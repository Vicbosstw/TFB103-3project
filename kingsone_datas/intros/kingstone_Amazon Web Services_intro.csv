Inhaltlich unver瓣nderte Neuauflage. Die Service-orientierte Architektur (SOA) als eine Form von entferntem Funktionsaufruf ist aktuell in aller Munde. Dabei ist das Prinzip, auf dem die Service-orientierte Architektur beruht, schon seit den 1970er Jahren bekannt und angewandt. Durch die fortschreitende Vernetzung von Anwendungssystemen entstehen jedoch immer neue M繹glichkeiten, Funktionen auf entfernten Systemen zu nutzen. Der Autor gibt einen ?berblick 羹ber die Service-orientierte Architektur allgemein sowie 羹ber XML Web Services als eine M繹glichkeit, eine SOA umzusetzen. Dar羹ber hinaus werden die Chancen f羹r den Einsatz von XML Web Services in einem Redaktionssystem dargestellt. Das Buch richtet sich an Studenten der Wirtschaftswissenschaften und der Informatik sowie an Praktiker gleicherma?en. IT-Manager k繹nnen und Anwender von Systemen, die XML Web Services benutzen oder zur Verf羹gung stellen, k繹nnen in vorliegendem Buch ihr Wissen auffrischen.

Revision with unchanged content. In this book we define a methodology for the semi-automated aggregation and adaptation of Web services capable of suitably overcoming semantic and behaviour mismatches in view of business process integration within and across organisational boundaries. We tackle the aggregation and adaptation of services described by service contracts, which consist of signature (WSDL), ontology information (OWL), and behaviour specification (YAWL). We first describe an aggregation technique that automatically generates contracts of composite services satisfying (behavioural) client requests from a registry of service contracts. Further on, we present a behaviour-aware adaptation technique that supports the customisation of services to fulfil client requests. The adaptation technique can be used to adapt the behaviour of services to satisfy both functional and behavioural requests. We support the generation of service contracts from real-world service descriptions by introducing a pattern-based compositional translator for the automated generation of YAWL workflows from BPEL business processes. In this way, we pave the way for the formal analysis, aggregation, and adaptation of BPEL processes.

Web services are self-contained applications that can be located on and invoked over the Internet. Because web services are built with standards such as XML, SOAP, UDDI, and WSDL, they are platform-neutral. For example, a sales rep may visit a local buyer who wants to order 10 copies of a book. Rather than waiting until he gets back to the office to place the order, the sales rep can review the inventory of the warehouse on his PDA using a web service and place the order immediately. If the local warehouse is short on inventory, another web service can search other distributors and their inventory and present alternate warehouses and quantities from which the sales rep can choose. The rep can select an option, and place the order via the web service.  The OMG's Unified Modeling Language, UML 2.0,  is a standard language for modeling software systems. The specifications for UML 2.0 is expected to be approved in first quarter 2003.

Inhaltlich unver瓣nderte Neuauflage. In den letzten Jahren erfuhren Web Services eine immer gr繹?ere Verbreitung. Mittlerweile ist es mit Hilfe von Prozessbeschreibungssprachen m繹glich, mehrere Web Services miteinander zu einem komplexen Web Service zu kombinieren. Urspr羹nglich wurden Web Services als Kommunikations- und Austauschform zwischen Softwareanwendungen konzipiert. Web Services unterst羹tzen damit in erster Linie B2B (Business-to-Business) Beziehungen. Mittlerweile ist aber auch die Anforderung entstanden, Web Services f羹r B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Beziehungen einzusetzen. Da die Nutzerinteraktion 羹ber ein Benutzerinterface erfasst werden muss, liegt die Problemstellung vor allem darin, abh瓣ngig vom Zustand des Gesch瓣ftsprozesses und je nach Ein- und Ausgabeparameter dynamisch eine passende und nutzerfreundliche Benutzerschnittstelle zu generieren. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, L繹sungen f羹r diese Problemstellung zu finden, zu evaluieren und anhand dieser Analyse ein Konzept vorzustellen, wie menschliche Benutzerinteraktionen in komplexen Web Services m繹glich sind.

Diese Arbeit demonstriert am Beispiel von Web Content Management Systemen (WCMS), wie eine breite Anzahl von Web Services in einer gebrauchstauglichen Art und Weise verwendet werden kann. Sie identifiziert dabei das Web als Plattform f羹r Inhalte und Anwendungen mit oft sehr gro?en und heterogenen Benutzerkreisen als interessante Herausforderung f羹r die Umsetzung von Usabilityzielsetzungen. Der Erfahrungsschatz der einzelnen Personen im Umgang mit dem Web divergiert ebenso wie die M繹glichkeiten und Eigenheiten der benutzten Endger瓣te, Plattformen und Browser.

Revision with unchanged content. The wide adoption of XML and related technologies led to the rise of a new paradigm for applications development. Web Services: WS, extend the traditional role of the Web for a stronger support for business to business interactions. The WS paradigm is based on the exposure of WS functionality via an interface description which has the potential of making WS available for various kinds of end-users. Another very promising future of WS consists of the potential of composing basic WS to produce more complex WS with a wide range of functionalities. The SOA was proposed to position the key players in this new paradigm where main operations will be executed using technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. The management of Quality of Web services: QoWS, as integral part of WS management will play an important role for the success of this paradigm. In this work, we investigate the management of QoWS for basic and composite WS by taking it into consideration as part of a systematic process for the development of WS. We studied the development of a new framework that intends to capture major management operations and the necessary extensions of SOA to support QoWS management.

This book provides practical information about web archives, offers inspiring examples for web archivists, raises new challenges, and shares recent research results about access methods to explore information from the past preserved by web archives. The book is structured in six parts. Part 1 advocates for the importance of web archives to preserve our collective memory in the digital era, demonstrates the problem of web ephemera and shows how web archiving activities have been trying to address this challenge. Part 2 then focuses on different strategies for selecting web content to be preserved and on the media types that different web archives host. It provides an overview of efforts to address the preservation of web content as well as smaller-scale but high-quality collections of social media or audiovisual content. Next, Part 3 presents examples of initiatives to improve access to archived web information and provides an overview of access mechanisms for web archives designed to be used by humans or automatically accessed by machines. Part 4 presents research use cases for web archives. It also discusses how to engage more researchers in exploiting web archives and provides inspiring research studies performed using the exploration of web archives. Subsequently, Part 5 demonstrates that web archives should become crucial infrastructures for modern connected societies. It makes the case for developing web archives as research infrastructures and presents several inspiring examples of added-value services built on web archives. Lastly, Part 6 reflects on the evolution of the web and the sustainability of web archiving activities. It debates the requirements and challenges for web archives if they are to assume the responsibility of being societal infrastructures that enable the preservation of memory. This book targets academics and advanced professionals in a broad range of research areas such as digital humanities, social sciences, history, media studies and information or computer science. It also aims to fill the need for a scholarly overview to support lecturers who would like to introduce web archiving into their courses by offering an initial reference for students.

This project deals with the problem of administrative overload in managing students, faculty; support personnel, and course data in the University, taking a case study of the University of Uyo, AKS, Nigeria. It proposes a Secure Student Information System (SSIS). This is expected to be a secure web-based data management system as a solution. Having this goal in mind, object-oriented design, client-server architectures, server-side application development tools, and database technologies are explored. Security measures are designed where necessary on the system to prevent unauthorized access and the best configuration of these tools is selected. These application development tools will be mainly open source software - where the user can have access to and modify the source code. As a result of the study, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and Apache server pages are found as the optimal servers side programming tools for the application. A working prototype of the system is provided based on MySQL DBMS, Apache web server, and PHP server pages.

The school of thought surrounding the urban ecosystem has increasingly become in vogue among researchers worldwide. Since half of the world's population lives in cities, urban ecosystem services have become essential to human health and wellbeing. Rapid urban growth has forced sustainable urban developers to rethink important steps by updating and, to some degree, recreating the human-ecosystem service linkage. Assessing, as well as estimating the losses of ecosystem services can denote the essential effects of urbanization and increasingly indicate where cities fall short. This book contains 13 thoroughly refereed contributions published within the Special Issue ""Urban Ecosystem Services"". The book addresses topics such as nature-based solutions, green space planning, green infrastructure, rain gardens, climate change, and more. The contributions highlight new findings for landscape architects, urban planners, and policymakers. Important future cities research is considered by looking at the system connectivity between the social and ecological sphere-via varying forms of urban planning, management, and governance. The book is supported by methods and models that utilize an urban sustainability and ecosystem service-centric focus by adding knowledge-base and real-world solutions into the urbanization phenomenon.

This book focuses on finding a way to sustain or enhance the learners' motivation during the learning process within a Web-Based Intelligent Tutoring System (WITS) environment. Studies showed that one of the biggest challenges in asynchronous e-learning environments (such as WITS) is how to keep learners motivated for the entire learning process. Thus, the main question was how best the system should behave in order to sustain or enhance the learners' motivation in such environments. This book suggested that the WITS may use motivational tactics rules to sustain/enhance the learners' motivation during the learning process. The first phase of this study uses an interview approach to extract the motivational tactics rules. The result of the interviews was extracting 64 motivational tactics rules in the form of event-condition-action. Those rules were validated in the second phase of this study using a questionnaire involving 120 participants.

The performance of SMEs in The Gambia is very poor; a possible solution is to provide mentoring service to them. Mentoring is the function of nurturing and supporting by providing SMEs with professional skills development, and moral support to positively impact on the business sustainability. However, little studies relate to mentoring of agricultural SMEs in The Gambia. This study empirically investigates the basic profile of agricultural business mentoring, the skill sets; and to represent the importance of the skills as represented in the model and to understand the mentoring for start-up business in the country. Semi structured questionnaires with reference to literature studies from other countries were used to gather data. Data was collected from staffs. A sample size of 100 respondents from the agro-enterprises was identified, out of which 62 were received. Results indicated that limited numbers of female staffs were involved in agro-enterprises. Male dominated in all areas (83.3% for managers; 78.0 employees), probably due to cultural influences.

This book focuses on how local, national and international civil society groups opposed the Belo Monte and S瓊o Luiz do Tapaj籀s hydroelectric projects in the Brazilian Amazon. In doing so, it explores how contemporary opposition to hydropower projects demonstrate a form of 'contested sustainability' that highlights the need for sustainable development agendas to take more into account than merely greenhouse gas emissions.   The assertion that society must look to successfully transition away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources often appears assured in contemporary environmental governance. However, what is less certain is who decides which forms of energy are deemed 'sustainable'. Contesting Hydropower in the Brazilian Amazon explores one process in which the sustainability of a 'green' energy source is contested. It focuses on how civil society actors have both challenged and reconfigured dominant pro-dam assertions that present the hydropower schemes explored as renewable energy projects that contribute to sustainable development agendas. The volume also examines in detail how anti-dam actors act to render visible the political interests behind a project, whilst at the same time linking the resistance movement to wider questions of contemporary environmental politics.   This interdisciplinary work will be of great interest to students and scholars of Sustainable Development, Environmental Justice, Environmental Governance and Development Studies.

A Wireless ad-hoc network is a temporary network set up by wireless mobile computers (or nodes) moving arbitrary in the places that have no network infrastructure. Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Black Hole Attack against network integrity absorbing all the packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur. There are lots of detection and defense mechanisms to eliminate the intruder that carry out the black hole attack. In this thesis, we simulated the black hole attack in various wireless ad-hoc network scenarios and have tried to find a response system in simulations.Similarly, another attack is Gray Hole Attack against network integrity which absorbs all data packets in the network In this thesis, we simulated the gray hole attack in various wireless ad-hoc network scenarios

This book provides comparative data on fish ecology and small-scale fisheries between Tapajos (clear water) and Negro (black water) rivers, in the Brazilian Amazon. These rivers are less studied than white water rivers and few books on Amazon fishes have addressed more than one river basin. These data can serve as a baseline to check future changes or impacts in these rivers, which can be affected by development projects, such as highways, deforestation, mining and dams. Besides information on fish biology, the book also discusses fish uses, fisheries and its importance for riverine people, comparing these data for each fish species between sites located inside and outside conservation units. The book is an outcome of the research project 'Linking sustainability of small-scale fisheries, fishers' knowledge, conservation and co-management of biodiversity in large rivers of the Brazilian Amazon', which was coordinated by the editor of this volume and funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NAS).

With the proliferation of GPS devices in daily life, trajectory data that records where and when people move is now readily available on a large scale. As one of the most typical representatives, it has now become widely recognized that taxi trajectory data provides rich opportunities to enable promising smart urban services. Yet, a considerable gap still exists between the raw data available, and the extraction of actionable intelligence. This gap poses fundamental challenges on how we can achieve such intelligence. These challenges include inaccuracy issues, large data volumes to process, and sparse GPS data, to name but a few. Moreover, the movements of taxis and the leaving trajectory data are the result of a complex interplay between several parties, including drivers, passengers, travellers, urban planners, etc. In this book, we present our latest findings on mining taxi GPS trajectory data to enable a number of smart urban services, and to bring us one step closer to the vision of smart mobility. Firstly, we focus on some fundamental issues in trajectory data mining and analytics, including data map-matching, data compression, and data protection. Secondly, driven by the real needs and the most common concerns of each party involved, we formulate each problem mathematically and propose novel data mining or machine learning methods to solve it. Extensive evaluations with real-world datasets are also provided, to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of using trajectory data. Unlike other books, which deal with people and goods transportation separately, this book also extends smart urban services to goods transportation by introducing the idea of crowdshipping, i.e., recruiting taxis to make package deliveries on the basis of real-time information. Since people and goods are two essential components of smart cities, we feel this extension is bot logical and essential. Lastly, we discuss the most important scientific problems and open issues in mining GPS trajectory data.

Build custom SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) tasks using Visual Studio Community Edition and C#. Bring all the power of Microsoft .NET to bear on your data integration and ETL processes, and for no added cost over what you've already spent on licensing SQL Server. New in this edition is a demonstration deploying a custom SSIS task to the Azure Data Factory (ADF) Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR).  All examples in this new edition are implemented in C#. Custom task developers are shown how to implement custom tasks using the widely accepted and default language for .NET development. Why are custom components necessary? Because even though the SSIS catalog of built-in tasks and components is a marvel of engineering, gaps remain in the available functionality. One such gap is a constraint of the built-in SSIS Execute Package Task, which does not allow SSIS developers to select SSIS packages from other projects in the SSIS Catalog. Examples in this book show how to create a custom Execute Catalog Package task that allows SSIS developers to execute tasks from other projects in the SSIS Catalog. Building on the examples and patterns in this book, SSIS developers may create any task to which they aspire, custom tailored to their specific data integration and ETL needs.  What You Will LearnConfigure and execute Visual Studio in the way that best supports SSIS task developmentCreate a class library as the basis for an SSIS task, and reference the needed SSIS assembliesProperly sign assemblies that you create in order to invoke them from your taskImplement source code control via Azure DevOps, or your own favorite tool setTroubleshoot and execute custom tasks as part of your own projectsCreate deployment projects (MSIs) for distributing code-complete tasksDeploy custom tasks to Azure Data Factory Azure-SSIS IRs in the cloudCreate advanced editors for custom task parameters Who This Book Is ForFor database administrators and developers who are involved in ETL projects built around SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). Readers do not need a background in software development with C#. Most important is a desire to optimize ETL efforts by creating custom-tailored tasks for execution in SSIS packages, on-premises or in ADF Azure-SSIS IRs.

The major benefit of a remote desktop connection is being able to connect to your data from anywhere in the world. Your data is in one place that is easy to see and you no longer have to have software installed on your own computer. Azure is one of the best virtual computers and networks providers for remote desktop (RDP) connections. When you create Azure account, you pay as you go. You purchase Azure services with pay-as-you-go pricing. You pay only for what you use each month, with no upfront commitment, and cancel anytime. You must add your credit/debit card for billing to use pay as you go subscription.But I was looking for totally free subscription where I don't need to add my credit card for billing. I found there are two possible options for that: 1) A sandbox gives you access to Azure resources. Your Azure subscription will not be charged. The sandbox may only be used to complete training on Microsoft Learn. Creating the Azure Virtual machines using sandbox which is learning subscription, you can connect to the VM via RDP port but you cannot access to Internet through the Internet Explorer. 2) Alternatively Microsoft Azure provides a free $100 credit for students accounts registered through university emails (free student subscription for around one year). There is internet access in the VM machine under this type of subscription.Azure documentations is too deep and it is hard to be understand creating and managing virtual computers and networks in Auzre for remote access connection by any beginner.

The contemporary world is characterized by the massive use of digital communication platforms and services that allow people to stay in touch with each other and their organizations. On the other hand, it is also a world with great challenges in terms of crisis, disaster, and emergency situations of various kinds. Thus, it is crucial to understand the role of digital platforms/services in the context of crisis, disaster, and emergency situations. The Handbook of Research on Digital Services in Crisis, Disaster, and Emergency Situations presents recent studies on crisis, disaster, and emergency situations in which digital technologies are considered as a key mediator. Featuring multi- and interdisciplinary research findings, this comprehensive reference work highlights the relevance of society's digitization and its usefulness and contribution to the different phases and types of risk scenarios. Thus, the book investigates the design of digital services that are specifically developed for use in crisis situations and examines services such as online social networks that can be used for communication purposes in emergency events. Highlighting themes that include crisis management communication, risk monitoring, digital crisis intervention, and smartphone applications, this book is of particular use to governments, institutions, corporations, and professionals who deal with crisis, disaster, and emergency scenarios, as well as researchers, academicians, and students working in fields such as communications, multimedia, sociology, political science, and engineering.

As a developer new to Web Services, how do you make sense of this emerging framework so you can start writing your own services today? This concise book gives programmers both a concrete introduction and a handy reference to XML web services, first by explaining the foundations of this new breed of distributed services, and then by demonstrating quick ways to create services with open-source Java tools.Web Services make it possible for diverse applications to discover each other and exchange data seamlessly via the Internet. For instance, programs written in Java and running on Solaris can find and call code written in C# that run on Windows XP, or programs written in Perl that run on Linux, without any concern about the details of how that service is implemented. A common set of Web Services is at the core of Microsoft's new .NET strategy, Sun Microsystems's Sun One Platform, and the W3C's XML Protocol Activity Group.In this book, author Ethan Cerami explores four key emerging technologies: XML Remote Procedure Calls (XML-RPC)SOAP - The foundation for most commercial Web Services developmentUniversal Discovery, Description and Integration (UDDI)Web Services Description Language (WSDL)For each of these topics, Web Services Essentials provides a quick overview, Java tutorials with sample code, samples of the XML documents underlying the service, and explanations of freely-available Java APIs. Cerami also includes a guide to the current state of Web Services, pointers to open-source tools and a comprehensive glossary of terms.If you want to break through the Web Services hype and find useful information on these evolving technologies, look no further than Web Services Essentials.

We all see what the internet does and increasingly don't like it, but do we know how and more importantly who makes it work that way? That's where the real power lays... The internet was supposed to be a thing of revolutions. As that dream curdles, there is no shortage of villains to blame--from tech giants to Russian bot farms. But what if the problem is not an issue of bad actors ruining a good thing? What if the hazards of the internet are built into the system itself? That's what journalist James Ball argues as he takes us to the root of the problem, from the very establishment of the internet's earliest protocols to the cables that wire it together. He shows us how the seemingly abstract and pervasive phenomenon is built on a very real set of materials and rules that are owned, financed, designed and regulated by very real people. In this urgent and necessary book, Ball reveals that the internet is not a neutral force but a massive infrastructure that reflects the society that created it. And making it work for--and not against--us must be an endeavor of the people as well.

This book transfers the newest service research concepts, such as value co-creation, to family forestry context. The book is aimed at as learning material for higher-education students in Western economies, and as a handbook for forest scientists worldwide. It has a strong theoretical base, but also a practical orientation with examples of novel forest services from different regions and contexts. The five parts of the book are: I Conceptualization of Service Approaches in Family Forestry; II Market and Policy Environment; III Public Service and Business Innovations; IV Communication, Cooperation, and Organizations for Services; and V Transitions Governance. Each part begins with a chapter that is more conceptual and thus sets the stage for the subsequent chapters, which then focus on a regional perspective or some more specific theme under the part's coverage.

Revision with unchanged content. An often stated problem in the state-of-the-art web search is its lack of user adaptation, as all users are presented with the same search results for a given query string. The effectiveness of a personalization of web search shows high variance in performance depending on the query, the user and the search context. To this end, carefully choosing the right personalization strategy in a context sensitive manner is critical for an improvement of search results. In this book, we first introduce some fundamentals of the general information retrieval process as well as incorporating relevance feedback information. We also present a brief summary of current personalization approaches followed by the presentation of a general framework that dynamically adapts the query-result ranking to the different information needs in order to improve the search experience for the individual user. This book is intended to act as a focal point for researchers and practitioners whose work is related to web information seeking and interaction, and with a precise focus on search personalization.

Integrating SOA and Web Services highlights how to integrate and realize Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with web services, which is one of the emerging technologies in IT. It additionally focuses on the latest technologies such as Metadata Management, Security issues, Quality of Service, and its commercialization. One chapter is also devoted to the study of Emerging standards and development tools for Enterprise Application Integration. Most enterprises have made extensive investments in system resources over the course of many years. Such enterprises have an enormous amount of data stored in legacy enterprise information systems (EIS), so it is not practical to discard existing systems. It is more cost-effective to evolve and enhance EIS. This could be done with the help of SOA. SOA is usually realized through web services. Web services specifications may add to the confusion of how to best to utilize SOA to solve business problems. In order for a smooth transition to SOA, using an architectural style that helps in realizing web services through SOA, this book concentrates on this architecture, realization, and integration of SOA with web services. It consists of 12 chapters and is recommended for all postgraduate Computer Science Students.

The World Wide Web has now been in use for more than 20 years. From early browsers to today's principal source of information, entertainment and much else, the Web is an integral part of our daily lives, to the extent that some people believe 'if it's not online, it doesn't exist.' While this statement is not entirely true, it is becoming increasingly accurate, and reflects the Web's role as an indispensable treasure trove. It is curious, therefore, that historians and social scientists have thus far made little use of the Web to investigate historical patterns of culture and society, despite making good use of letters, novels, newspapers, radio and television programmes, and other pre-digital artefacts. This volume argues that now is the time to ask what we have learnt from the Web so far.

This book is designed using Visual ASP .Net 2010 and MS-SQL Server 2008. The coding language used is VB.NET. The project involves settings for various options such as searching the web pages and extracts the mail ids, web URLs, phone numbers, songs download links and tags such as heading tags. The depth level is given so that not only from the given web pages but the pages linked with this web page are searched and the content is extracted. Multi-threading approach is used so that each page is searched by a separate thread and this assists in faster process. In the proposed system multiple web-pages can be searched in same or different web site with an intelligent search, thus it takes the resource from a webpage with the usage of depths. The intelligent search is performed using an advanced extraction called regular expression and so any kind of information can be extracted. For example, the pattern \d{6} retrieves the Indian Pincodes.

Inhaltlich unver瓣nderte Neuauflage. Die Zeiten des anonymen WWW sind vorbei. Der Mensch im Web 2.0 m繹chte pr瓣sent sein, will seine Identit瓣t preis-geben. Doch er will bei weitem nicht alles zeigen und schon gar nicht jedem. Identit瓣tsmanagement ist ein Stiefkind im heutigen Internet: Be-herrscht von wenigen Webangeboten - zwischen Marktinteressen und Daten-schutz. Wer mehr als Nickname und E-Mail-Adresse verbreiten m繹chte, w羹rde dies gerne nur einmal f羹r alle Angebote tun. Der Nutzer will Kontrolle 羹ber seine Daten behalten und frei gestalten k繹nnen. Bisher war dies nur ein Traum. Bekannte Techniken in Kombination erm繹glichen es, beliebige Identit瓣tsdaten aus-tauschbar, aufwandsarm und nutzerkontrolliert f羹r Netz-Dienste zur Ver-f羹-gung zu stellen: Ontologien erm繹glichen eine Verst瓣ndigung 羹ber die Art von Inhalten. Sie bilden ein Rahmenwerk f羹r Identit瓣tsdaten. Modular aufgebaut wird so ein Rahmenwerk f羹r Identit瓣tsdaten aus Einzelkomponenten: Aus Teil-on-to-lo-gien f羹r beispielsweise Adress-Daten des Online-Kaufhauses, Bewertungen einer Auktionsplattform und Interessenangaben aus einem Forum setzt sich das Ger羹st f羹r die Daten einer Identit瓣t zusammen.

Revision with unchanged content. Everyday, we engage in the use of networked information systems and websites to search for information. Whatever information users search for, it is highly possible that it can be found somewhere in the digital world. But, oftentimes, searching for information is neither effective nor efficient. When a user searches for information, a system often returns a large number of irrelevant results. Thus, the critical issue facing the current digital world is not the lack of information, but ill-structured information and inefficient information retrieval.This study concerned the testing of user performance when searching an ontology-driven information retrieval (ONTOIR) system that shows explicit relationships among resources. The goal was to examine whether or not ontology enhances user performance in terms of recall and search time. The experiment was conducted with 40 participants to evaluate and compare the differences in user performance (recall and search time) between an ontology-driven information retrieval system and a traditional, thesaurus-driven information retrieval system. Better recall and shorter search time were found when conducting relationship-based queries in an ontology-driven information retrieval system as compared to a thesaurus-based system. The book is addressed to knowledge managers, information architects, and other information professionals.

This book's main goals are to bring together in a concise way all the methodologies, standards and recommendations related to Data, Queries, Links, Semantics, Validation and other issues concerning machine-readable data on the Web, to describe them in detail, to provide examples of their use, and to discuss how they contribute to - and how they have been used thus far on - the ""Web of Data"". As the content of the Web becomes increasingly machine readable, increasingly complex tasks can be automated, yielding more and more powerful Web applications that are capable of discovering, cross-referencing, filtering, and organizing data from numerous websites in a matter of seconds.The book is divided into nine chapters, the first of which introduces the topic by discussing the shortcomings of the current Web and illustrating the need for a Web of Data. Next, ""Web of Data"" provides an overview of the fundamental concepts involved, and discusses some current use-cases on the Web where such concepts are already being employed. ""Resource Description Framework (RDF)"" describes the graph-structured data model proposed by the Semantic Web community as a common data model for the Web. The chapter on ""RDF Schema (RDFS) and Semantics"" presents a lightweight ontology language used to define an initial semantics for terms used in RDF graphs. In turn, the chapter ""Web Ontology Language (OWL)"" elaborates on a more expressive ontology language built upon RDFS that offers much more powerful ontological features. In ""SPARQL Query Language"" a language for querying and updating RDF graphs is described, with examples of the features it supports, supplemented by a detailed definition of its semantics. ""Shape Constraints and Expressions (SHACL/ShEx)"" introduces two languages for describing the expected structure of - and expressing constraints on - RDF graphs for the purposes of validation. ""Linked Data"" discusses the principles and best practices proposed by the Linked Data community for publishing interlinked (RDF) data on the Web, and how these techniques have been adopted. The final chapter highlights open problems and rounds out the coverage with a more general discussion on the future of the Web of Data.  The book is intended for students, researchers and advanced practitioners interested in learning more about the Web of Data, and about closely related topics such as the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Linked Data, Graph Databases, Ontologies, etc. Offering a range of accessible examples and exercises, it can be used as a textbook for students and other newcomers to the field. It can also serve as a reference handbook for researchers and developers, as it offers up-to-date details on key standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL, SHACL, ShEx, RDB2RDF, LDP), along with formal definitions and references to further literature. The associated website webofdatabook.org offers a wealth of complementary material, including solutions to the exercises, slides for classes, raw data for examples, and a section for comments and questions.

Websites are most important for information dissemination in this technological era. One of the important factors for the success of any organization or institution is its websites. Academic websites provide information about universities, institutes and departments, resources and services, faculty members, students, alumni and others. A good and well designed academic website is not only an excellent media for publicizing the activities and services but also helps to bring it, to the notice of the users about all the significant information which they must know in using their products and services. The aim of the academic websites' study is to evaluate the level of accomplishment of required characteristics such as usability, functionality, reliability and efficiency comparing partial and global preferences. In this study, an attempt has been made to identify the credibility factors for academic websites with respect to user perspectives. Based on the credibility factors identified by the Library and Information Science professionals, the academic websites are assessed. The expectations of the academic websites were identified and opinions about credibility factors were evaluated.

Revision with unchanged content. This book investigates several research problems which arise in modern Web Information Retrieval. First of all we consider the fact that there are many situations where a flat list of ten search results are not enough, and that the users might desire to have a larger number of results grouped on-the-fly in folders of similar topics. In this book, we describe Snaket, a hierarchical clustering meta-search engine which personalizes searches according to the clusters selected on-the-fly by users. Second, we consider those situations where users might desire to access fresh information such as news articles. We present a new ranking algorithm suitable for ranking those fresh type of information. Third, we will discuss numerical methodologies for accelerating the ranking methodologies used in Web Search. An important achievement for this book is that we show how to address the above predominant issues of Web Information Retrieval by using clustering and ranking methodologies. We demonstrate that both clustering and ranking have a mutual reinforcement property that has not yet been studied intensively.

At first sight, browsing the World Wide Web is a fairly intuitive and simple activity, but it turns out that users often experience difficulties in finding the information and services that they are looking for - or in returning to items that they have visited before. In order to improve the current design of Web sites and Web browsers, or to provide users with personalized interfaces, one needs to know how users interact with the Web. Although theoretical models and empirical data exist, the knowledge that they provide is limited and scattered. In this book, we integrate current insights and extend this body of knowledge with a number of user studies. Several methods are presented for obtaining, clearing, analyzing and visualizing Web usage data. Various aspects of user navigation styles are discussed. Particular attention is given to the issue why, when and how often users return to Web pages, and how browsers can support this more effectively. An important observation is that the Web has evolved from a hypermedia system to a hybrid between hypermedia and interactive applications. This book targets researchers and professionals who want to better understand and support the users that visit their Web sites or that make use of their applications and tools.

The main objective of reducing the gap between processor speed and memory speed, is achieved by proposing customization techniques to the web caches. These techniques can enhance the performance of the traditional web cache replacement policies deployed at the client side browser caches. This concept can be extended to group of users, so that the cache deployed in intermediate stages can also be customized to cater to a group of users and for co-operative caches. Experimenting with a grid of co-operating caches and speculating the interests and surfing pattern of more than one client is a real challenge.

Revision with unchanged content. Meanwhile web-services are starting to be established through out the busi-ness world, but web-services only offer stateless operation calls. Since workflow management systems are widely accepted to execute long-term (stateful) business processes within companies, the next step of great interest is to make stateful cooperative processes available through the web, so that two or more partners can collaborate in a long-term business process. BPEL is a joint attempt of Microsoft and IBM to establish a standard to make such cooperative processes available through the web. We attempt to enhance robustness and flexibility of these processes by introducing quality cons-traints. The whole of all quality constraints referring to a process ins-tance should provide a frame, in which the flow of this process instance is correct. To prove the concept of our quality constraint approach called WEPD (Web-Flow Extended Process Description) we implemented MaX (Monitoring and eXception handling component). This book defines WEPD and explains the implementation of the monitoring component of MaX. It is written for computer science graduate students as well as IT professionals and IT mana-gers.

Services like Youtube or MySpace, which stand for the Internet of the second generation, have attracted attention on the consumer market. The company market on the other hand has not been strongly influenced by the new trend. But Web 2.0 could also be used to improve enterprise information technology. Exam-ples are Web 2.0 concepts, which increase the effectiveness of data handling or concepts, which provide new communication methods. Therefore the use of Web 2.0 concepts in an enterprise context seems worth considering. Claus-M. Menzel explains in this book how the Web 2.0 approach could be used in an enterprise context and why the adoption of Web 2.0 could be a benefit for companies. For this objective the essence of Web 2.0 will first be clarified, as well as why and how this concept is working. It will be deduced which Web 2.0 elements can be used within companies and how they need to be adjusted to be used there. Furthermore this book will introduce technologies and applications which can be used for the realisation of web 2.0 in companies and compare these with the common enterprise infor-mation technologies.

The World Wide Web contains large volumes of Web pages that are poorly characterized in terms of both metadata and structure descriptions. Metadata is the data that describe data, for Web pages, it may provide a significant amount of information about the Web without examining its content and serves a variety of purposes. At the other side, the search engine needs to scrape all Web pages of the target Website, when a new Web page is first available, it will typically take several days-for the page to be detected and indexed by the search engine. Until a page has been indexed, the users cannot find information about it on search engine results. This represents a time and resource-consuming operation and heavy network bandwidth consumption involved with the retrieval of the mark-up code of these Web pages which finally affects the users by increasing the time taken for new content or a content modification to be reflected in the search engines results. For instance, Web-related metadata can improve search efficiency and the quality of the search results. This thesis proposes an approach called Multilateral Web Indexing Model (MWIM), which aims to describe a solution to the previous.

As Web-based interactive 3D graphics, popularly referred to as Virtual Reality (VR), continue to become more affordable, research and development groups in various fields have been adopting Web-based VR technology. Despite sub-stan-tial adoption, how and how much the technology benefits target users and the providers who choose to adapt the technology is not well un-der-stood. Previous research has established that VR provides users with unique human-computer interaction. However, little is known about how users ex-pe-rience the Web-based VR technology and how user-system interaction con-tri-bu-tes to system usability. This book investigates user perception of Web-based VR comparing to conventional 2D graphics and system usability affec-ted by the user-system interaction process. The impact of Web-based VR on sy-stem usability was empirically examined from an integrated view of tech-no-lo-gy acceptance in information systems and human-computer interaction. In addition, the impact of user characteristics on user-system interaction while using a VR system was examined. This book provides new knowledge about usability, sense of presence and tech-nology acceptance in VR and provides insights for future research, which should be important to anyone designing, developing and evaluating a VR system in general and to an electronic commerce or market research system in particular.

Revision with unchanged content. In the last years, the Web has become an invaluable source of information for almost every domain of knowledge. This has motivated researchers to considering the Web as a valid repository for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition. In this sense, Ontology Learning from web resources is a particularly interesting topic as Ontologies are required to achieve interoperability and information understanding in knowledge intensive environments such as the Semantic Web. This book analyzes the ontology construction process from the automatic learning point of view. It presents a novel approach for Ontology Learning, introducing new methods for knowledge acquisition from the Web. The adaptation of several learning techniques to the web corpus and the exploitation of particular characteristics of the Web environment composing an automatic, un-supervised and domain independent approach distinguishes the present proposal from previous works. The discussion, methods and results presented in this work should help researchers interested in taking profit from the information available in the Web and to create a consistent base of ontologies required for the Semantic Web.

Ranking - the algorithmic decision on how relevant an information artifact is for a given information need and the sorting of artifacts by their concluded relevancy - is an integral part of every search engine. In this book we investigate how structured Web data can be leveraged for ranking with the goal to improve the effectiveness of search. We propose new solutions for ranking using on-the-fly data integration and experimentally analyze and evaluate them against the latest baselines.

Web applications occupy a large space within the IT infrastructure of a business or a corporation. They simply just don't touch a front end or a back end; today's web apps impact just about every corner of it. Today's web apps have become complex, which has made them a prime target for sophisticated cyberattacks. As a result, web apps must be literally tested from the inside and out in terms of security before they can be deployed and launched to the public for business transactions to occur.  The primary objective of this book is to address those specific areas that require testing before a web app can be considered to be completely secure. The book specifically examines five key areas:    Network security: This encompasses the various network components that are involved in order for the end user to access the particular web app from the server where it is stored at to where it is being transmitted to, whether it is a physical computer itself or a wireless device (such as a smartphone).  Cryptography: This area includes not only securing the lines of network communications between the server upon which the web app is stored at and from where it is accessed from but also ensuring that all personally identifiable information (PII) that is stored remains in a ciphertext format and that its integrity remains intact while in transmission.  Penetration testing: This involves literally breaking apart a Web app from the external environment and going inside of it, in order to discover all weaknesses and vulnerabilities and making sure that they are patched before the actual Web app is launched into a production state of operation.  Threat hunting: This uses both skilled analysts and tools on the Web app and supporting infrastructure to continuously monitor the environment to find all security holes and gaps.  The Dark Web: This is that part of the Internet that is not openly visible to the public. As its name implies, this is the ""sinister"" part of the Internet, and in fact, where much of the PII that is hijacked from a web app cyberattack is sold to other cyberattackers in order to launch more covert and damaging threats to a potential victim.  Testing and Securing Web Applications breaks down the complexity of web application security testing so this critical part of IT and corporate infrastructure remains safe and in operation.

This study was conducted to investigate the perception of farmers of the effectiveness of the extension officers in the Kabbe Constituency, Namibia. A sample of 40 farmers was selected through a simple random sampling technique, and five extension technicians were interviewed in a focus group. Data were collected from farmers using a structured questionnaire that addressed the need of farmers regarding extension services being offered to them by the extension officers. This study was important in the context of the fact that sustainable food production is central to the alleviation of poverty in Namibia. In order to achieve sustainable food production, agricultural extension officers must be able to carry out their intended function: to offer their skills and expertise in sustainable agricultural methods and also to help the farmers to help themselves in addressing sustainable food production. This study further investigated how extension officers themselves define and execute their role, as well as how the perceptions and attitudes of the recipients of these services - the rural farmers - also impact the success of sustainable agricultural development programmes.

Revision with unchanged content. Mobile computing devices like PDAs, cell phones or laptops have become an indispensable part of everyday's life. As these systems are battery-powered and the user expects long operating times, energy-aware operation is crucial. Hardware components for mobile devices offer low-power operating modes that achieve energy savings at the cost of degraded performance or appli-cation quality, e.g., by reducing the CPU speed. This dissertation investigates software-controlled energy management and addresses these two, often conflicting goals: increasing the embedded system's runtime by saving energy and providing sufficient application quality. With a cooperative approach between the operating system and individual applications or the user, task-specific trade-offs between these goals can be made. Prototype implementations for embedded Linux are presented and evaluated with energy measurements, proving the feasibility of task-specific power management. This dissertation has a strong practical focus, being a valuable guide for computer scientists and software engineers both in academia and industry who deal with operating system design and low-power software architectures.

Internet of Things (IoT) is a technique to connect each and everything to the Internet, and it provides anything at any time regardless of irrespective of the location of the thing. As we are moving towards the IoT, the number of sensors deployed around the world is also growing at a rapid pace and an accelerated growth is expected in future. An increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are being developed in both research as well as commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection still remains a critical requirement and a challenge owing to its diversity and heterogeneity. This text presents a new architecture for fog computing along with mathematical modeling and logical design to achieve the minimized latency. Various methods have been introduced so as to carefully choose the fog node that helps in reducing the overall delay and generating quick responses. Different methods have been proposed to carry out a low latency and energy efficient sensor selection process for IoT services in the fog environment associated with any application presented in the form of flow based process(FBP).

Revision with unchanged content. The last few years have experienced a steady growth in research institutions' interest in developing research projects that involve more than one insti-tution's computing resources - forming virtual organizations. The goal of any virtual organization is to provide member institutions with an interoperable, easy to use and secure research environment. Shibboleth was one of the pre-mier choices of infrastructure to be used to create collaborative inter-institu-tional research environments as it provides a coherent architecture to securely share computing resources across multiple institutions without the need for individualized user credentials for each shared resource. Some of the prob-lems that Shibboleth encountered in practice deal with its distributed authentication and authorization mechanisms and its user data accessability design. This work addresses these issues and provides a solution that allows for fine-grained authorization services in any virtual organization. We pro-pose an extension to the Shibboleth design by separating the definition, management, and usage of the user's virtual organization entitlements from the identity provider. This book is addressed to professionals in Informa-tionTechnology, researchers and students in Distributed Systems, Networking and Security.

The Amazon is a land of superlatives. The complex ecosystem covers an area about the size of the continental U.S. The Amazon River discharges 57 million gallons of water per second--in two hours, this would be enough to supply all of New York City's 7.5 million residents with water for a year. Its flora and fauna are abundant. Approximately one of every four flowering plant species on earth resides in the Amazon. A single Amazonian river may contain more fish species than all the rivers in Europe combined. It is home to the world's largest anteater, armadillo, freshwater turtle, and spider, as well as the largest rodent (which weighs over 200 lbs.), catfish (250 lbs.), and alligator (more than half a ton). The rainforest, which contains approximately 390 billion trees, plays a vital role in stabilizing the global climate by absorbing massive amounts of carbon dioxide--or releasing it into the atmosphere if the trees are destroyed. Severe droughts in both Brazil and Southeast Asia have been linked to Amazonian deforestation, as have changing rainfall patterns in the U.S., Europe, and China. The Amazon also serves as home to millions of people. Approximately seventy tribes of isolated and uncontacted people are concentrated in the western Amazon, completely dependent on the land and river. These isolated groups have been described as the most marginalized peoples in the western hemisphere, with no voice in the decisions made about their futures and the fate of their forests. In this addition to the What Everyone Needs to Know� series, ecologist and conservation expert, Mark J. Plotkin, who has spent 40 years studying Amazonia, its peoples, flora, and fauna. The Amazon offers an engaging overview of this irreplaceable ecosystem and the challenges it faces.

Enterprises have made amazing advances by taking advantage of data about their business to provide predictions and understanding of their customers, markets, and products. But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today. The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way. The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.

Ecosystem services are developed through the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment defines ecosystem services as the benefits people derive from the ecosystem. The concept of ecosystem services has become a very important model for relating ecosystem functions to that of human welfare. Ecosystem services are categorized into four broad groups namely provisioning services, supporting services, cultural services and regulating services. For all the four categories of the ecosystem services, much attention is given to only the provisioning aspect neglecting the other relevant services such as regulating services. Some researchers have reported that, the human use of ecosystem services especially provisioning services has accelerated in the last 50 years and that they are being over-utilized. This study aimed at evaluating the ecosystem services, its importance and how to maintain ecological integrity with specific objectives of determining the effects of the respondents' demographic characteristics on their valuation of the ecosystems services as well as their willingness to pay and participate in the conservation the forest reserve.

Revision with unchanged content. Descriptions of data in the Semantic Web easily grow larger and more complex than the descriptions of traditional web pages and are thus more difficult to handle. The problem of how to structure complex systems has been addressed in traditional software engineering for decades and is commonly solved by splitting systems into components using different techniques. Recently, new techniques, like Aspect-Oriented Programming or the more generic Invasive Software Composition, were developed to fulfill newly emerging composition needs. These gray-box composition approaches access components through a well-defined interface, but modify internal parts of components during composition. This book investigates in trans-ferring composition techniques from the software engineering to the semantic web domain using the concepts of Invasive Software Composition. It shows how composition operators can be defined for software, query and ontology composition alike and how they can be tailored for specific needs of the Semantic Web domain. This book targets software engineers, researchers and students interested in modern software composition techniques and the emerging challenges of the Semantic Web.

Aquatic ecosystems are rich in biodiversity and home to a diverse array of species and habitats, providing a wide variety of benefits to human beings. Many of these valuable ecosystems are at risk of being irreversibly damaged by human activities and pressures, including pollution, contamination, invasive species, overfishing and climate change. Such pressures threaten the sustainability of these ecosystems, their provision of ecosystem services and ultimately human well-being.Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is now widely considered the most promising paradigm for balancing sustainable development and biodiversity protection, and various international strategies and conventions have championed the EBM cause and the inclusion of ecosystem services in decision-making. This open access book introduces the essential concepts and principles required to implement ecosystem-based management, detailing tools and techniques, and describing the application of these concepts and tools to a broad range of aquatic ecosystems, from the shores of Lough Erne in Northern Ireland to the estuaries of the US Pacific Northwest and the tropical Mekong Delta.

Revision with unchanged content. Relational.OWL is a technique to automatically convert a relational database into a Semantic Web representation, enabling Semantic Web applications to access data actually stored in relational databases using their own built-in functionality. Since this representation does not result in objects containing real semantics, we additionally show how to create mappings from the rela-tional model to a target ontology using an arbitrary closed RDF query language. Using current Semantic Web techniques, a formerly relational data item, once converted to its Semantic Web representation, can neither be identified unambiguously, nor be backtracked to its original storage location in the relational database. We hence introduce a novel URI scheme for identifying not only databases, but also their schema and data components like tables or columns, giving us the possibility to specify the exact and identifying storage location of any data item in its original data source.

The World Wide Web can be considered a huge library that in consequence needs a capable librarian responsible for the classification and retrieval of documents as well as the mediation between library resources and users. Based on this idea, the concept of the ""Librarian of the Web"" is introduced which comprises novel, librarian-inspired methods and technical solutions to decentrally search for text documents in the web using peer-to-peer technology.The concept's implementation in the form of an interactive peer-to-peer client, called ""WebEngine"", is elaborated on in detail. This software extends and interconnects common web servers creating a fully integrated, decentralised and self-organising web search system on top of the existing web structure. Thus, the web is turned into its own powerful search engine without the need for any central authority.This book is intended for researchers and practitioners having a solid background in the fields of Information Retrieval and Web Mining.

Revision with unchanged content. With the advent of an increasing number of multicast services such as audio/video streaming and news broadcast, accounting for the resources consumed by subscribers becomes essential. However, multicast environ-ments are inherently more susceptible to attacks. Although e-commerce protocols such as SSL, TLS, and SET protocols offer some forms of security, they cannot be directly applied to secure e-commerce sessions in the multi-cast environment. As secured multicast services gain popularity in the Internet, at one point there would be a significant response from the service providers to support e-commerce through multicast networks. Therefore, this book presents a Multicast Security Protection Profile (MSPP) that identifies and secures the operating environment of multicast sessions. An architectural framework called SETMS has been designed to secure e-commerce trans-actions for multicast services. It provides authentication of host through HIP, authorization of subscriber and his e-payments through a variant of the 2KP, accounting for the subscriber's resource consumption, and supports non-repudiation through PKI. SETMS has been evaluated using the CC based MSPP specs and validated using the AVISPA. The book is addressed to professionals and researchers involved in securing computer networks; multicast and e-commerce environments, and the e-commerce protocol designers.

Website security made easy. This book covers the most common ways websites get hacked and how web developers can defend themselves. Every website today is vulnerable to attack and a compromised website can ruin a company's reputation. Consider the Heartland Payment System data breach of 2008: the Heartland attackers made off with 130 million credit card numbers using a SQL injection attack to gain access to the web-servers that handled payment data. Web Security for Developers covers everything a web developer needs to know about web security. Readers will learn who attackers are and what they have at their disposal, how the Internet and websites operate, and various ways websites get attacked. Author Malcolm McDonald explores common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, as well as common vulnerabilities like information leakage. The first half of the book describes security concepts every developer should know while the second half delves into the individual vulnerabilities themselves, offering real-world examples and code samples.

This volume explores major wetland ecosystem services, such as climate cooling and water quality improvement, and discusses the recent wetland conservation and restoration activities in China and neighboring countries. The role of wetlands in either cooling or warming the climate is analyzed as the net balance between carbon sequestration and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. Wetlands start off having a net warming effect on the climate but in time switch to net cooling. Further, they remove 40% of the N and P from run-off and groundwater flow in agricultural areas, but wetlands need to amount to 10% of the total catchment area to make a difference.Reflecting on the recent large investment in wetland ecological studies in China and neighboring countries, the book addresses invasive species in coastal wetlands as well as the protection and wise use of tidal flats around the Yellow Sea. It also presents promising regional case studies on wetland restoration. The book is intended for academics, students and practitioners in the field of wetland ecology, management and restoration, as well as consultants and professionals working in conservation, wise use and environmental policy.

Given Perl's natural fit for web applications development, it's no surprise that Perl is also a natural choice for web services development. It's the most popular web programming language, with strong implementations of both SOAP and XML-RPC, the leading ways to distribute applications using web services. But books on web services focus on writing these applications in Java or Visual Basic, leaving Perl programmers with few resources to get them started. Programming Web Services with Perl changes that, bringing Perl users all the information they need to create web services using their favorite language.Programming Web Services with Perl steers clear of the hype surrounding web services and concentrates on what is useful and practical. The book introduces the major web services standards, such as XML-RPC, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, and shows how to implement Perl servers and clients using these standards. You'll find detailed references on both the XML and SOAP toolkits, and learn when to use one technology in favor of the other. The book is rich with programming examples that you'll find useful well past the learning stage. And, moving beyond the basics, the book offers solutions to problems of security, authentication, and scalability.Some of the topics covered in the book are: HTTP and XML basicsXML-RPC and the toolkitsSOAP and toolkitsSOAP:: LiteUsing SOAP with SMTP and other protocolsAdvertising and discovering with UDDI and WSDLThe REST methodologyThe future of web servicesProgramming Web Services with Perl was written for Perl programmers who have no prior knowledge of web services. You can pick up this book without any understanding of XML-RPC or SOAP and be able to apply these technologies easily, through the use of publicly available Perl modules detailed in the book.If you're interested in applying XML-RPC and SOAP technologies to distributed programming applications, then Programming Web Services with Perl is a book you'll want to have.

Flexible packaging today has one of the highest growth rates across all printing sectors, achieving an annual global growth of close to five percent. Important trends include smaller run lengths, a requirement for multi-versions and variations, personalization and a growing interest in adding in-line value ‒ all undoubted opportunities for narrow- and mid-web label converters (using both flexo and digital technology) to capture a growing portion of the flexibles market.Jobs with the shortest run sizes are in pouches of any kind, as well as in single serve and one-dose packs and sachets. These are key areas where label converters can most readily enter the flexible packaging market. Indeed, narrower and mid-web conventional and digital printing has effectively opened up the market to a whole range of new customers who have never previously had a solution for short-run flexible packaging orders.But it's not all quite straightforward for a label converter to move into flexible packaging. They need to have a comprehensive understanding of paper, foil and filmic substrates ‒ as well as multi-layer constructions and barrier properties, of pack sealing, and of the specific user requirements needed for the many different types of liquids, powders, gels, creams and solids that have to be packaged. Pre-press requirements are different, inks have to withstand sealing, web- and sealing widths are important, co-efficient of slip can be critical, while a good understanding of form, fill and seal machines is ideal.This book has set out to provide both the knowledge and expert guidance for label and other converters looking to enter or expand their production into flexible packaging ‒ a key stepping stone to success.Chapters include:   Flexible packaging - an introductionPaper and board, metallic foil, films and multi-layer constructionsTypes of flexible packaging and special constructionsPre-press, printing and convertingUnderstanding forming, filling, sealing and lidding operationsMarkets, applications and opportunities

This second edition of the book Green Web-II - Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN Program / Policy Development in Environment Conservation Domain: with reference to India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh investigates the IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states of South Asia with different capacities. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in biodiversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at the global, regional and country levels. This book adds to our knowledge firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have previously been mainly the subject of political science. Secondly, it critically explores one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Finally, the research also shows the historical development of global institutions and IUCN's activities with member nations in helping to define or redefine the concept of global governance. The outcomes of this research will also be beneficial for global collaboration, networking, and for the identification of common concerns among the many environmental and conservational organizations at the international and national level. In this broader sense, the research outcomes might be beneficial to constituencies of the global North as well as global South because of the nature and coverage of IUCN and its role in conservation policy formation. This effort may serve as a model for additional research on international organizations.  Technical topics discussed in the book include: The Motivation for Environmental Conservation- How personal efforts make a differenceThe Role of International Environment Conservation OrganizationsThe Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theoryGovernance performance and Competitiveness Popularity indicesKnowledge creation and diffusionConservation commons

This volume presents a parametric, packet-based, comprehensive model to measure and predict the audiovisual quality of Internet Protocol Television services as it is likely to be perceived by the user. The comprehensive model is divided into three sub-models referred to as the audio model, the video model, and the audiovisual model. The audio and video models take as input a parametric description of the audiovisual processing path, and deliver distinct estimates for both the audio and video quality. These distinct estimates are eventually used as input data for the audiovisual model. This model provides an overall estimate of the perceived audiovisual quality in total. The parametric description can be used as diagnostic information. The quality estimates and diagnostic information can be practically applied to enhance network deployment and operations. Two applications come to mind in particular: Network planning and network service quality monitoring. The audio model can be used indifferently for both applications. However, two variants of the video model have been developed in order to address particular needs of the applications mentioned above. The comprehensive model covers effects due to resolution, coding, and IP-packet loss in case of RTP-type transport. The model applied to quality monitoring is standardized under the ITU-T Recommendations P.1201 and P.1201.2.

CQA archives of previously asked questions and their answers, this means that one can freely ask any question on web forums and expect some good, honest answers. On other side, it takes effort to go through all possible answers of a search question and to make sense of them but this process take too much time like the popular question to have 100 of answers, and it is very time-consuming for a user to inspect them all. To resolve this problem thus system mainly works on the ranking of QA pairs and online forums. These QA pairs are ranked by fine-grained and QA forwarding techniques.This technique ranks based on the rating given by the common user. This technique explicitly captures relationships between questions and their best answers by modeling topical dependencies. In some of condition unsatisfied answers on system resolved by online forum system with direct communication. In the QA system, not only a user can post questions and answers, but also it can correct spell at the time of posting question and answer, this system used fuzzy spell check API.

Though almost no one knows it, the most diverse forests and aquatic systems in the nation lie in Alabama. Described as America's Amazon, Alabama has more species per square mile than any other state. Its rivers are home to more species of fish, crayfish, salamanders, mussels, snails and turtles than any other aquatic system in North America. And the contest isn't even close. California, for instance, has nine species of crayfish, while Alabama has eighty-four. The Colorado River system, which drains seven Southwestern states, is home to 26 species of fish, while Alabama's rivers are home to 350 species. But the wild places of the state are also under siege. Alabama has suffered more aquatic extinctions than any other state. In fact, nearly half of all extinctions in the United States since the 1800s happened in Alabama, which has been logged, mined, and poisoned by a succession of industries. In this compelling portrait of the rough history of Alabama's rivers and the lands they flow through, Raines makes a case that more has been lost in Alabama than any other state thanks to the destructive hand of man. The version of Alabama that exists in the mind of the public - lynchings and fire hoses, cotton fields and steel mills - comes from things we've done to Alabama, and has for too long overshadowed the stunning natural splendor of the place. Saving America's Amazon highlights this other Alabama, a wild place of incredible diversity, of ancient gardens and modern edens. The ascendant view among scientists today is that Alabama's wild places should be treasured and protected as one of the richest and most diverse regions on the globe, an internationally important ""biodiversity hotspot."" But that is not what is happening on the ground in Alabama, which spends less on environmental protection than any other state. Instead, the constant stream of newly discovered species struggles to keep pace with the number of creatures being declared forever lost. The time of reckoning is here for the people of Alabama, who must decide whether their state will wear the crown for being the most diverse place on the continent, or the crown for the place with the most extinctions. One thing is certain, Alabama cannot lay claim to both crowns forever.

It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 11th ACM Conference on Web Science (Websci'19), June 30 - July 3, 2019, Boston, MA, USA.This year, the conference theme is ""Synergies for the Good: The Web and Society"". We welcomedinterdisciplinary contributions, especially those that had a broad perspective on the web, includingthose that combined analyses of web data with other types of data (e.g., from surveys or interviews)to better understand user behavior (online and offline); carried out longitudinal studies; presentedsuccessful cases of interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary web research; used mixed-methodapproaches; critically reflected on the methods used; discussed responsible forms of Web Science(e.g. regarding standards, methods, generalizability of results); and/or those that reflected on thesocietal impact of web research, how the web is perceived in the media and in society, and whetherthis clashes with our self-image of Web Science. Thus, research on the interaction of society and theweb was invited, and we received submissions highlighting web implications, synergies derived, and how the web as a socio-technical system will evolve in future.WebSci'19 was a unique conference where a multitude of disciplines converged in a creative andcritical dialogue with the aim of understanding the web and its impacts. WebSci'19 welcomedparticipation from diverse fields including (but not limited to) art, anthropology, computer andinformation sciences, communication, economics, humanities, informatics, law, linguistics, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. Following the tradition of earlierconferences, contributions to WebSci'19 aimed to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thecommunity engaged with novel and thought-provoking ideas and discussed original research, work in progress, analysis, and practice in the field of Web Science, its current theoretical, methodological, and epistemological challenges as well as Web practices of individuals, collectives, institutions, and platforms. This year we were very pleased to accept 41 submissions for the regular research track chosen outof 130 submissions. We are grateful for the support of the Program Committee which consisted of16 senior members and 66 regular members who selected an interesting, varied, exciting programcomprising 31 long and 10 short papers. In addition to the posters selected from the Call forPosters, eight contributions were invited to be presented as a poster because they sparked fruitfuldiscussions among the reviewers and were deemed to be of great interest and relevance to theWebSci'19 community.This year WebSci'19 encouraged authors to particularly prepare and publish reproducibilityinformation of conducted research and resources, such as source code and datasets. Authors wereasked to add (if possible) a link (e.g. DOI or URL) to data or any other information relevant to theirsubmission. With this measure WebSci'19 aimed at raising awareness of the reproducibility issueand demonstrated that, as a community-driven conference, it subscribes to and actively promotesOpen Science principles in research.

Human well-being depends in many ways on maintaining the stock of natural resources which deliver the services from which human's benefit. However, these resources and flows of services are increasingly threatened by unsustainable and competing land uses. Particular threats exist to those public goods whose values are not well-represented in markets or whose deterioration will only affect future generations. As market forces alone are not sufficient, effective means for local and regional planning are needed in order to safeguard scarce natural resources, coordinate land uses and create sustainable landscape structures.   This book argues that a solution to such challenges in Europe can be found by merging the landscape planning tradition with ecosystem services concepts. Landscape planning has strengths in recognition of public benefits and implementation mechanisms, while the ecosystem services approach makes the connection between the status of natural assets and human well-being more explicit. It can also provide an economic perspective, focused on individual preferences and benefits, which helps validate the acceptability of environmental planning goals. Thus linking landscape planning and ecosystem services provides a two-way benefit, creating a usable science to meet the needs of local and regional decision making.   The book is structured around the Driving forces-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses framework, providing an introduction to relevant concepts, methodologies and techniques. It presents a new, ecosystem services-informed, approach to landscape planning that constitutes both a framework and toolbox for students and practitioners to address the environmental and landscape challenges of 21st century Europe.

The last three decades have marked an era of technological upheaval as frenetic and groundbreaking as there ever has been. From early desktop computers and mobile phones to virtual reality: the web is now virtually inseparable from all facets of human interaction and daily life. But it wasn't always funny cat videos and sleek interfaces.This collection is a visual journey through time, gathering the very earliest examples of what we today take for granted: the first website to use surround sound, the first drag-and-drop navigation, the first page-turn effect, the first website to use seamless video integration, the first viral site, the first parallax website, the first 'upload-your-face' website, the first site to incorporate a mobile phone, the first ever YouTube-like ""website"", and many more.It gathers more than 200 websites, and each comes with quotes and insights from the creators themselves--an invaluable peek into the minds of pioneers who paved the pixelized way for many to follow, including Jonathan Gay (Flash), Gabo Mendoza (Gabocorp), Yugo Nakamura (Yugop), Peter Van Den Wyngaert (NRG.BE), Joshua Davis (Praystation), and Eric Jordan (2Advanced).This comprehensive visual history gathers 21 chapters that detail, for every year since 1998, the best websites and examples of hardware used at the time, and explore how user experience, usability, and technological milestones have influenced the development of the internet we use today. Year-by-year factsheets and smart Google insights orient the reader through major developments across such categories as world news headlines, highest grossing films, new soft and hardware, greatest website traffic, and many more.For many, this collection will offer a virtual trip down nostalgia lane--but all generations will find a sweeping reference work as well as a celebration of how the earliest creative minds came to define the web, and eventually the world, as we know it.

Content preparation is an integral part of the usability equation: it answers the question of what information is needed for effective decision making. Once content preparation has been established, the question how to present what can be answered. Content Preparation Guidelines for the Web and Information Appliances: Cross-Cultural Comparisons provides a theoretical foundation and operational tools to effectively prepare content so that users are able to make correct decisions regarding the purchase of goods and services. Traditionally, human aspects of computing have been assessed by usability evaluation methods, which determine how well the system is designed for joyful, satisfying, and productive use. But, effectively designing the how without providing a solid foundation for designing the what can not result in effective web and information appliance-based operations. This book presents a review and reappraisal of the science base of content preparation and descriptions of four major studies on content preparation involving more than 1,200 participants. Based on these studies, it establishes a factor structure of content preparation and relative importance of each factor in effective decision making and concludes with guidelines for the design of content for a variety of populations.Unlike previous publications in usability that have predominantly concentrated on how to present information, this book focuses on what information should be presented and the information appliances for different cultures. With a cross-cultural comparison and a review of fundamental theories, the book not only answers the question of what information needs to be presented for effective decision making, but also addresses the impact of culture on content usability.

A kingpin willing to murder to protect his dark web drug empire. A corrupt government official determined to avoid exposure. The death of a dark web drugs czar in mysterious circumstances in a Bangkok jail cell, just as the author arrives there. A death in Minnesota leads detectives into the world of dark web murder-for-hire where hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin is paid to arrange killings, beatings, and rapes. Meanwhile, the owner of the most successful hitman website in history is threatening the journalists who investigate his business with a visit from his operatives--and the author is at the top of his list. There's the world wide web--the internet we all know that connects us via news, email, forums, shopping, and social media. Then there's the dark web--the parallel internet accessed by only a select few. Eileen Ormsby has spent the past five years exploring every corner of the Dark Web. She has shopped on darknet markets, contributed to forums, waited in red rooms, and been threatened by hitmen on murder-for-hire sites. This book will take you into the murkiest depths of the web's dark underbelly: a place of hitmen for hire, red rooms, hurtcore sites, and markets that will sell anything a person is willing to pay for--including another person.

The Tapaj籀s River, a major tributary of the Amazon, is renowned for its extraordinary biodiversity and the vitality of its indigenous and riverine communities. But it is gradually being carved up by highways, hydroelectric dams and railways, built to allow agribusiness, the new powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, to export soya and other products though the Amazon River. Amazon Besieged tells the story of two writers' long investigative trip along the basin in 2016 and 2017. As if travelling through history, the authors were able to trace the way an outside economic force arrives and dispossesses earlier inhabitants. They started their journey in the south of the Tapaj籀s river basin, where modern Brazil is firmly entrenched, with its paved roads and huge soya plantations, and moved north, where outsiders are engaged in a violent tussle with the earlier inhabitants who still occupy much of the land. Travelling by canoe and pick-up, the authors visited remote indigenous villages and isolated communities of rubber-tappers and fisherfolk. They recorded moving testimony of the pressure these people are experiencing, with the arrival of dam builders, loggers and land-grabbers. At times, these outsiders show little respect for the law, openly sending in illegal militias to evict the original inhabitants. Yet the outcome is far from clear, for today indigenous and riverine communities know full well that they are struggling for their very survival. Overcoming traditional hostilities, they have created powerful new alliances and are forging links with environmentalists, who know that they are the true guardians of the forest.

The core idea behind Real World Web Services is simple: after years of hype, what are the major players really doing with web services? Standard bodies may wrangle and platform vendors may preach, but at the end of the day what are the technologies that are actually in use, and how can developers incorporate them into their own applications? Those are the answers Real World Web Services delivers. It's a field guide to the wild and wooly world of non-trivial deployed web services.The heart of the book is a series of projects, demonstrating the use and integration of Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and many more web services. Some of these vendors have been extremely successful with their web service deployments: for example, eBay processes over a billion web service requests a month!The author focuses on building 8 fully worked out example web applications that incorporate the best web services available today. The book thoroughly documents how to add functionality like automating listings for auctions, dynamically calculating shipping fees, automatically sending faxes to your suppliers, using an aggregator to pull data from multiple news and web service feeds into a single format or monitoring the latest weblog discussions and Google searches to keep web site visitors on top of topics of interest-by integrating APIs from popular websites most people are already familiar with.For each example application, the author provides a thorough overview, architecture, and full working code examples.This book doesn't engage in an intellectual debate as to the correctness of web services on a theological level. Instead, it focuses on the practical, real world usage of web services as the latest evolution in distributed computing, allowing for structured communication via Internet protocols. As you ll see, this includes everything from sending HTTP GET commands to retrieving an XML document through the use of SOAP and various vendor SDKs.

Ecology, like all literary narrative, has the potential for turnabout, surprise, lessons learned, and tragedy. The stories in Threads from the Web of Life and The Shark and the Jellyfish describe protagonists, their competitors, and the habitats that provide the setting for their interaction--habitats that have become surprisingly complex with the passage of evolutionary time.  One niche moves across a world of flowers that reaches its earliest peak bloom in the low valleys and then peaks later among the slopes of the foothills--a rolling habitat. Another hop-scotches across the ocean floor, compelling its occupants to migrate from the fallen body of one dead whale to the next. Yet another appears in the aftermath of typhoons, requiring its inhabitants to search the tropical coastline for the latest storm landfall.  These tales are filled with no less intrigue than other literary works, but they transpire out of the sight of most readers. Once known only to ecologists, in Threads from the Web of Life and The Shark and the Jellyfish, available for the first time in a single deluxe paperback, these stories become accessible to everyone with an interest in natural history.

What Is This Book About? This is a book about Web Services. Web Services are still more like a movement than a mature technology. The movement is motivated by a vision of a semi-auto- mated Web that can support long chains of interactions between autonomous agents. There are three important components to that vision. One is interoperabil- ity: a service can have clients (agents) from any platform, in any language. Another is autonomy: an agent can discover the services it needs from their published descriptions that include both what the service can do and how it does it (the interfaces of available actions). The third is (semi) automatic code creation: one description can be used by a development framework to automate the creation of code for clients and by the services themselves. As of today, interoperability is close to full realization, with only occasional glitches; autonomy is a distant vision; but it still has problems. Interoperability has been achieved code creation is useful in part by using an XML-based high-level protocol (SOAP) for message exchanges between clients and services. As long as the client can produce messages in the right format, it doesn't matter what language they're written in or on what platform they run. The first three chapters of our book show how to write platform-independent Web Services clients in Javascript and Java running from within a browser (IE6 or Mozilla).

 《為什麼你的好意害了貓？》

 第一本全面透析貓咪聖經，
 美國最具權威的貓行為專家教你如何正確理解貓咪思維、判讀貓咪行為語言、
 提供安全且舒適的貓咪生活環境、自主檢查貓咪健康狀況……

 如果你不懂貓，那你應該認真研究這本書的每一個主題，好讓自己具備貓咪的正確觀念；如果你認為你懂貓，那你更應該看！儘管你可能不需要了解如何挑選獸醫或如何設置貓砂盆，但採用像貓咪的邏輯思考，從貓咪的視角檢視他的生活，便能解決行為問題、防範潛在問題發生，避免飼主常犯的錯誤。
 沒錯，即使是經驗豐富的飼主，在貓科世界裡也往往會見樹不見林！過去你認為的對貓好，是不是其實讓貓很困擾？只要你願意，你的貓可以過得比你想得更好。

 ■ 給他真正需要的，才是愛
 我們往往將自己覺得「好的」提供給自己的愛貓，但卻有不少飼主忽略了，你的愛貓是否也覺得這樣是「好」？
 就像許多人喜歡在洗手間擺上擴香，因此覺得貓砂若有香味一定可以讓貓感到舒適；但事實上貓咪的嗅覺比人類敏感得多，這樣的香氛對貓來說過度刺激，反而會讓貓不想用貓砂。試想，你願意進入一間有著過濃香水的洗手間嗎？不要從飼主的角度出發，試著從貓咪的角度思考，讓他真正享受到你的愛！

 ■ 小心！這些行為問題與健康問題，肇因可能就是你！
 許多被我們貼上「壞」標籤的行為，其實在貓咪世界裡都是正常的舉動。動物並不笨，牠們重複出現的行為一定都具有某種目的。
 一時的便宜行事，都有可能讓貓誤解你是在獎勵他，一但你將貓咪的「壞行為」或「不正常」視為就是貓咪使壞這麼簡單，只會妨礙你找到解決辦法，破壞你與貓咪的感情，甚至導致他出現嚴重的健康警報。

《為什麼你給的溺愛貓不要？》

 美國最具權威的貓行為專家
 回答150個關於貓咪行為的疑難雜症！
 成功導正、停止貓咪惱人行為的關鍵就在於「理解」，
 便溺訓練、情緒溝通、環境打造、飲食須知、健康隱憂……全面解答。

 ■貓的不守規矩並不是簡單地出於「不爽」、「報復」或是「隨機」
 即使你跟貓咪相處幾十載，也深深愛著此生物，你還是有可能在撫摸他的時候被他們忽然不悅的舉動嚇到，不懂愛貓的情緒所為何來。對於貓咪，我們都有想問但無法獲得回答的問題，可能是為什麼他們總在奇怪的地方做奇怪的事情？更重要的是如何停止這樣的行為？現在，一切終於有了出口，這些問題都能獲得解答。

 □為什麼我的貓會舔我的頭髮？
 □為什麼我的貓只在我使用電腦時才對我撒嬌？
 □該如何讓我的貓咪和新來的毛小孩和平相處？甚至是即將共同生活的另一半？

 ■所有行為不當的貓，背後都有一位不諳貓性的飼主！
 沒有人像潘媽（潘˙強恩班奈特）這般了解貓咪，她專業地破除了飼主與一般人對於貓咪行為的錯誤迷思！在本書中，潘媽用她擔任貓行為顧問三十年的經驗，針對貓的疑難雜症，提供清楚、明瞭、簡單的答案。從幼貓的飼養、最困擾飼主的便溺問題、貓的醫療建議、不當行為分析與老貓注意事宜……全書以主題分類各式提問，提供已證實有效的方法來解決（或預防）貓咪行為問題。

 ■貓的這些行為肇因，甚至有些就是你自己！
 環境與飼主的行為大大地影響了貓的健康與否，貓的不良行為大部分跟貓受到的刺激或暗示很有關係。貓的行為也是與飼主的溝通，而你的回應也會間接「鼓勵」或是「嚇阻」到他，就像是大家都很喜歡的貓呼嚕，作者跟你說可別以為只是開心這麼簡單，有的時候貓反而是緊張也說不定。當貓出現這些行為時，你知道該如何正確理解與應對了嗎？

 本書特色：
 1、從幼貓到老貓，從挑選到送別，貓咪的一生全面關注。
 2、便溺問題、飲食給予、生活用品挑選、基礎美容方法、醫學建議，專業知識完整揭露！
 3、書末附有貓的內外科疾病醫療附錄，列出貓咪可能會罹患的疾病，方面飼主更了解所有這些會侵襲貓咪的疾病！

It used to be a few times a year Apple would take the stage and announce something that everyone's head exploded over! The iPhone! The iPad! The Apple Watch! The iPod!That still happens today, but Apple also is well aware of the reality: most people don't upgrade to new hardware every year. How does a company make money when that happens? In a word: services. In the past few years (especially in 2019) Apple announced several services--things people would opt into to pay for monthly. It was a way to continue making money even when people were not buying hardware.For it to work, Apple knew it had to be good. They couldn't just offer a subpar service and expect people to pay because it said Apple. It had to be good. And it is!This book will walk you through those services and show you how to get the most out of them.

Have you ever needed to share processing between two or more computers running programs written in different languages on different operating systems? Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers. And if you want to build your own XML-RPC implementation for another environment, the detailed explanations in this book will serve as a foundation for that work.

Java Web Services in a Nutshell is a high-speed tutorial and a quick reference for the technologies that Sun Microsystems is creating for implementing web services with Java. This book is a succinct introduction and handy reference to the Java/XML APIs, more commonly known as the JWSDP or ""Java Web Services Development Pack."" These APIs are taking the Java world by storm, as they are capable of handling everything from simple XML to SOAP to full ebXML vocabularies.Although ""web services"" technology has suffered from much hype and overly grand expectations, there is plenty of solid development going on, especially in extending enterprise applications, and a huge amount of this development is being done in Java. As a result, the J2EE APIs for web services are evolving rapidly, and this new ""in a Nutshell"" book covers them all in depth.One of the most important APIs in the JWSDP is JAX-RPC (Java API for XML-based RPC). It's also the API that developers most consistently post questions about. Java Web Services in a Nutshell covers all aspects of JAX-RPC in detail, with tutorial coverage alone exceeding 150 pages. This book offers developers everything they need to program with JAX-RPC.Java Web Services in a Nutshell begins with an introduction to Java web services, including a discussion of how they differ from web applications. The author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web services, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as the means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters cover: JAX-RPCSOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)Reliable SOAP messaging with JAXMWSDLAdvanced JAX-RPCJAXR, the XML-based registry APIWeb Services ToolsThe balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference containing documentation for the various API packages.Intended for Java developers who need to implement Java services or who need their applications to access existing web services, Java Web Services in a Nutshell delivers practical information to help developers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized official documentation. If web services and Enterprise Java are any part of your job description -- of if you'd like them to be -- you'll want this book close beside as you work.

Web 2.0 makes headlines, but how does it make money? This concise guide explains what's different about Web 2.0 and how those differences can improve your company's bottom line. Whether you're an executive plotting the next move, a small business owner looking to expand, or an entrepreneur planning a startup, Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide illustrates through real-life examples how businesses, large and small, are creating new opportunities on today's Web.This book is about strategy. Rather than focus on the technology, the examples concentrate on its effect. You will learn that creating a Web 2.0 business, or integrating Web 2.0 strategies with your existing business, means creating places online where people like to come together to share what they think, see, and do. When people come together over the Web, the result can be much more than the sum of the parts. The customers themselves help build the site, as old-fashioned ""word of mouth"" becomes hypergrowth.Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide demonstrates the power of this new paradigm by examining how: Flickr, a classic user-driven business, created value for itself by helping users create their own valueGoogle made money with a model based on free search, and changed the rules for doing business on the Web-opening opportunities you can take advantage ofSocial network effects can support a business-ever wonder how FaceBook grew so quickly?Businesses like Amazon tap into the Web as a source of indirect revenue, using creative new approaches to monetize the investments they've made in the WebWritten by Amy Shuen, an authority on Silicon Valley business models and innovation economics, Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide explains how to transform your business by looking at specific practices for integrating Web 2.0 with what you do.

The web services architecture provides a new way to think about and implement application-to-application integration and interoperability that makes the development platform irrelevant. Two applications, regardless of operating system, programming language, or any other technical implementation detail, communicate using XML messages over open Internet protocols such as HTTP or SMTP. The Simple Open Access Protocol (SOAP) is a specification that details how to encode that information and has become the messaging protocol of choice for Web services.Programming Web Services with SOAP is a detailed guide to using SOAP and other leading web services standards--WSDL (Web Service Description Language), and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration protocol). You'll learn the concepts of the web services architecture and get practical advice on building and deploying web services in the enterprise.This authoritative book decodes the standards, explaining the concepts and implementation in a clear, concise style. You'll also learn about the major toolkits for building and deploying web services. Examples in Java, Perl, C#, and Visual Basic illustrate the principles. Significant applications developed using Java and Perl on the Apache Tomcat web platform address real issues such as security, debugging, and interoperability.Covered topic areas include: The Web Services ArchitectureSOAP envelopes, headers, and encodingsWSDL and UDDIWriting web services with Apache SOAP and JavaWriting web services with Perl's SOAP:: LitePeer-to-peer (P2P) web servicesEnterprise issues such as authentication, security, and identityUp-and-coming standards projects for web servicesProgramming Web Services with SOAP provides you with all the information on the standards, protocols, and toolkits you'll need to integrate information services with SOAP. You'll find a solid core of information that will help you develop individual Web services or discover new ways to integrate core business processes across an enterprise.

第一本全面透析貓咪聖經，
 美國最具權威的貓行為專家教你如何正確理解貓咪思維、判讀貓咪行為語言、
 提供安全且舒適的貓咪生活環境、自主檢查貓咪健康狀況……

 如果你不懂貓，那你應該認真研究這本書的每一個主題，好讓自己具備貓咪的正確觀念；如果你認為你懂貓，那你更應該看！儘管你可能不需要了解如何挑選獸醫或如何設置貓砂盆，但採用像貓咪的邏輯思考，從貓咪的視角檢視他的生活，便能解決行為問題、防範潛在問題發生，避免飼主常犯的錯誤。

 沒錯，即使是經驗豐富的飼主，在貓科世界裡也往往會見樹不見林！過去你認為的對貓好，是不是其實讓貓很困擾？只要你願意，你的貓可以過得比你想得更好。

■ 給他真正需要的，才是愛
 我們往往將自己覺得「好的」提供給自己的愛貓，但卻有不少飼主忽略了，你的愛貓是否也覺得這樣是「好」？
 就像許多人喜歡在洗手間擺上擴香，因此覺得貓砂若有香味一定可以讓貓感到舒適；但事實上貓咪的嗅覺比人類敏感得多，這樣的香氛對貓來說過度刺激，反而會讓貓不想用貓砂。試想，你願意進入一間有著過濃香水的洗手間嗎？不要從飼主的角度出發，試著從貓咪的角度思考，讓他真正享受到你的愛！

【你的貓咪不是你的貓咪！】
× 因為家具一直被破壞，所以想帶貓咪去爪……
 這是個非常嚴酷的手術，相當於將你每根手指的第一指節切除，光想就覺得很痛吧！若貓咪會破壞家具，請先回到貓咪的思考，確認自己是否有提供穩定且合適材質的貓抓板、貓抓柱？

× 選擇有蓋貓砂盆，避免味道外洩，並確保尿液與貓砂不會掉出貓砂盆外。
 有蓋貓砂盆的確能防止臭味外洩──因為所有的臭味都被關在貓砂盆內，因此你的貓咪每次進去排泄時都得忍受濃厚的臭味。
 另外個子較高的貓咪可能必須低頭以避免頂到貓砂盆的上蓋，你能想像自己在一間空氣不流通又非常窄小的洗手間還能感到舒適嗎？

【愛之適足以害之】
× 覺得貓咪就是喜歡吃鮪魚，乾脆單純餵食貓咪鮪魚→
 消耗身體的維他命E，引起脂肪組織炎（steatitis）

× 依照飼料包上的用餐指示，甚至還常常獎勵零食→
 沒有考量自家貓咪的狀態，不知不覺讓貓越來越胖，誘發心臟病、糖尿病和關節炎

■ 小心！這些行為問題與健康問題，肇因可能就是你！
 許多被我們貼上「壞」標籤的行為，其實在貓咪世界裡都是正常的舉動。動物並不笨，牠們重複出現的行為一定都具有某種目的。

 一時的便宜行事，都有可能讓貓誤解你是在獎勵他，一但你將貓咪的「壞行為」或「不正常」視為就是貓咪使壞這麼簡單，只會妨礙你找到解決辦法，破壞你與貓咪的感情，甚至導致他出現嚴重的健康警報。

【這樣誤解，害了你也害了貓咪】
 貓咪忽然無差別撒尿，以為貓只是耍脾氣而對他動怒→
 無差別撒尿是一種名為貓下泌尿道疾病（FLUTD）的常見病徵，貓咪若罹患貓下泌尿道疾病會出現頻尿的症狀，但每次只能排出少量尿液。
 隨著症狀惡化，膀胱發炎會導致貓咪出現急尿的情況，必須立刻排尿以舒緩不適。

 因為貓咪一直跟在身後猛打、亂叫、咬人，而施予體罰→
 貓咪缺乏持續的刺激，就會出現尋求關注的行為。請思考最近是否確實因為忙碌而減少陪伴貓咪玩耍的時間，體罰不僅不人道，其實也是一種變相的回應，會導致貓咪誤解，只要我這麼做，就會獲得關注，進而繼續行為。

■ 我們覺得自己的貓咪應該更懂事，但其實我們才是應該更懂事的人
 我們對貓咪的要求真的很多，把他們整天關在家裡無事可做，硬塞他們不想要的同伴給他們，定了一堆規矩還朝令夕改。我們不帶貓咪出門散步，還規定他們只能在貓砂盆裡便溺，但貓砂盆的清潔度往往遠低於貓咪的標準。

 請別忘了，你與貓咪的關係就是一段真正的感情，就像任何感情一樣，你們必須互相溝通，了解彼此的需求。

 人們往往承擔了成為貓咪飼主的責任，卻期望由貓咪單方面付出：希望貓咪壓抑天性，而且能神奇地理解這個說著他根本聽不懂的語言的巨人內心的所有想法。

 身為飼主的你有責任教育自己，以便了解這個你選擇共度人生的美麗生物。請藉由本書學會解讀貓咪要傳達的訊息、了解貓咪的需求，理解貓咪的行為！

本書特色

 1、從幼貓到老貓，從挑選到送別，貓咪的一生全面關注。
 2、便溺問題、飲食給予、生活用品挑選、基礎美容方法、醫學建議，專業知識完整揭露！
 3、書末附有貓的內外科疾病醫療附錄，列出貓咪可能會罹患的疾病，方面飼主更了解所有這些會侵襲貓咪的疾病！

Describing the technologies to combine language resources flexibly as web services, this book provides valuable case studies for those who work in services computing, language resources, human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and service science. The authors have been operating the Language Grid, which wraps existing language resources as atomic language services and enables users to compose new services by combining them. From architecture level to service composition level, the book explains how to resolve infrastructural and operational difficulties in sharing and combining language resources, including interoperability of language service infrastructures, various types of language service policies, human services, and service failures.The research based on the authors' operating experiences of handling complicated issues such as intellectual property and interoperability of language resources contributes to exploitation of language resources as a service. On the other hand, both the analysis based on using services and the design of new services can bring significant results. A new style of multilingual communication supported by language services is worthy of analysis in HCI/CSCW, and the design process of language services is the focus of valuable case studies in service science. By using language resources in different ways based on the Language Grid, many activities are highly regarded by diverse communities.This book consists of four parts: (1) two types of language service platforms to interconnect language services across service grids, (2) various language service composition technologies that improve the reusability, efficiency, and accuracy of composite services, (3) research work and activities in creating language resources and services, and (4) various applications and tools for understanding and designing language services that well support intercultural collaboration.

This volume contains lecture notes of the 14th Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2018), held in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, in September 2018. The research areas of Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Knowledge Graphs have recently received a lot of attention in academia and industry. Since its inception in 2001, the Semantic Web has aimed at enriching the existing Web with meta-data and processing methods, so as to provide Web-based systems with intelligent capabilities such as context awareness and decision support. The Semantic Web vision has been driving many community efforts which have invested a lot of resources in developing vocabularies and ontologies for annotating their resources semantically. Besides ontologies, rules have long been a central part of the Semantic Web framework and are available as one of its fundamental representation tools, with logic serving as a unifying foundation. Linked Data is a related research area which studies how one can make RDF data available on the Web and interconnect it with other data with the aim of increasing its value for everybody. Knowledge Graphs have been shown useful not only for Web search (as demonstrated by Google, Bing, etc.) but also in many application domains.

Web services are poised to become a key technology for a wide range of Internet-enabled applications, spanning everything from straight B2B systems to mobile devices and proprietary in-house software. While there are several tools and platforms that can be used for building web services, developers are finding a powerful tool in Microsoft's .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET. Designed from scratch to support the development of web services, the .NET Framework simplifies the process--programmers find that tasks that took an hour using the SOAP Toolkit take just minutes.  Programming .NET Web Services is a comprehensive tutorial that teaches you the skills needed to develop web services hosted on the .NET platform. Written for experienced programmers, this book takes you beyond the obvious functionality of ASP.NET or Visual Studio .NET to give you a solid foundation in the building blocks of web services, and leads you step-by-step through the process of creating your own. Beginning with a close look at the underlying technologies of web services, including the benefits and limitations, Programming .NET Web Services discusses the unique features of the .NET Framework that make creating web services easier, including the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the namespaces used in .NET programming. Filled with numerous code examples using the C# language, the book leads you through some of the more challenging issues of web services development, including the use of proxies, marshalling of complex data types, state management, security, performance tuning and cross-platform implementation. The book also covers: Creating and publishing your first web service The UDDI project, tModels and what they mean for web service publishers Securing web service applications  Written for programmers who are familiar with the .NET Framework and interested in building industrial-strength web services, Programming .NET Web Services is full of practical information and good old-fashioned advice.

Getting to Know Web GIS, a workbook with detailed, step-by-step exercises, teaches readers how to share resources online and build web GIS applications easily and quickly. It covers Esri's suite of web GIS technologies including ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS for Server, web app templates, WebApp Builder, API for JavaScript, mobile GIS apps, mobile SDKs, CityEngine, and 3D web maps.  Holistic Approach: Unlike books that focus on individual products, this book teaches web GIS technologies as a holistic platform. Each chapter completes an application project using multiple products from server side to browser/client side. Easy to Apply: You don't have to be a developer to build web apps. This book facilitates immediate productivity. It teaches how to build engaging web apps without a single line of programming. The two chapters involving programming are easy to follow and don't require a strong programing background.

A gripping first-person account of how scientists came to understand our universe's mysterious structureJ. Richard Gott was among the first cosmologists to propose that the structure of our universe is like a sponge made up of clusters of galaxies intricately connected by filaments of galaxies--a magnificent structure now called the cosmic web and mapped extensively by teams of astronomers. Here is his gripping insider's account of how a generation of undaunted theorists and observers solved the mystery of the architecture of our cosmos.The Cosmic Web begins with modern pioneers of extragalactic astronomy, such as Edwin Hubble and Fritz Zwicky. It goes on to describe how, during the Cold War, the American school of cosmology favored a model of the universe where galaxies resided in isolated clusters, whereas the Soviet school favored a honeycomb pattern of galaxies punctuated by giant, isolated voids. Gott tells the stories of how his own path to a solution began with a high-school science project when he was eighteen, and how he and astronomer Mario Jurič measured the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies, a filament of galaxies that, at 1.37 billion light-years in length, is one of the largest structures in the universe.Drawing on Gott's own experiences working at the frontiers of science with many of today's leading cosmologists, The Cosmic Web shows how ambitious telescope surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are transforming our understanding of the cosmos, and how the cosmic web holds vital clues to the origins of the universe and the next trillion years that lie ahead.-- ""Publishers Weekly""

This book develops a crowdsourced sensor-cloud service composition framework taking into account spatio-temporal aspects. This book also unfolds new horizons to service-oriented computing towards the direction of crowdsourced sensor data based applications, in the broader context of Internet of Things (IoT). It is a massive challenge for the IoT research field how to effectively and efficiently capture, manage and deliver sensed data as user-desired services. The outcome of this research will contribute to solving this very important question, by designing a novel service framework and a set of unique service selection and composition frameworks.Delivering a novel service framework to manage crowdsourced sensor data provides high-level abstraction (i.e., sensor-cloud service) to model crowdsourced sensor data from functional and non-functional perspectives, seamlessly turning the raw data into ""ready to go"" services. A creative indexing model is developed to capture and manage the spatio-temporal dynamism of crowdsourced service providers.Delivering novel frameworks to compose crowdsourced sensor-cloud services is vital. These frameworks focuses on spatio-temporal composition of crowdsourced sensor-cloud services, which is a new territory for existing service oriented computing research. A creative failure-proof model is also designed to prevent composition failure caused by fluctuating QoS.Delivering an incentive model to drive the coverage of crowdsourced service providers is also vital. A new spatio-temporal incentive model targets changing coverage of the crowdsourced providers to achieve demanded coverage of crowdsourced sensor-cloud services within a region.The outcome of this research is expected to potentially create a sensor services crowdsourcing market and new commercial opportunities focusing on crowdsourced data based applications. The crowdsourced community based approach adds significant value to journey planning and map services thus creating a competitive edge for a technologically-minded companies incentivizing new start-ups, thus enabling higher market innovation.This book primarily targets researchers and practitioners, who conduct research work in service oriented computing, Internet of Things (IoT), smart city and spatio-temporal travel planning, as well as advanced-level students studying this field. Small and Medium Entrepreneurs, who invest in crowdsourced IoT services and journey planning infrastructures, will also want to purchase this book.

In questo saggio: si espone la teoria dell`evoluzione di specie animali che hanno generato esseri evoluti prima ancora che qualunque cosa assomigliasse ad un uomo, creando delle civilt? pre-umane; si cerca il luogo in cui sorgeva Atlantide e si ipotizzano i luoghi e il modo in cui gli antichi l`abbiano lasciata usando un tipo particolare di energia.Attraverso un linguaggio semplice, si parte dall`idea di Dale Russel, raccogliendo le testimonianze di questi esseri in libri antichi, nei Testi Sacri, nei Libri Sacri, e persino nei ritrovamenti di scheletri, aggiungendo nuove teorie a quelle postulate da altri illustri scienziati riconosciuti e non dalla scienza ufficiale, fino a giungere alla mia teoria sulla frequenza dei corpi animati e non. Ci saranno citati spezzoni di Testi Sacri; storie che narrano di esseri che hanno trasmesso il sapere ai ""sacerdoti del tempio""; storie di esseri che sono diventati ostili nei confronti dell`uomo; storie di esseri che hanno preso in sposa le figlie degli uomini per creare gli ""Eroi del passato"" e persino storie inventate da me per spiegare meglio.Tra tutte queste storie, il saggio si conclude con quelle che narrano di esseri che usavano veicoli capaci di spostarsi, non solo sulla terra e nell`acqua, ma anche nell`aria e tra un pianeta e l`altro o addirittura tra una galassia e l`altra e con l'uso di un energia da me ipotizzata che ho chiamato ""induzione di frequenza"".

There exists a small, hard-core percentage of UFO reports that defy all efforts by scientists to explain away as natural or man-made objects. Providing considerable details of a strange symmetrical metallic and glowing object that can scoot around in the air at phenomenal speeds and still reveal to the witnesses when landed on the ground and at close range of artificial looking features, such as a door, portholes, certain fixed or movable fuselage protrusions, flashing lights, and in some cases even the occupants themselves, these odd-looking objects have raised considerable interest among some scientists.The question on the minds of curious and open-minded scientists is, ""What are these objects?""In 1969, a US government-sponsored study by the University of Colorado headed by Dr Edward U. Condon concluded that UFO reports on the whole represented nothing new to science and, therefore, will not advance our scientific knowledge. If there is anything electromagnetic about the nature of UFOs as noted by genuine witnesses, one must assume it has to be ball lightning.Now, after looking at the reports, SUNRISE has uncovered something to advance science, and with it a new technology.The scientific advancement comes by way of our understanding of the nature of radiation and how it interacts with solid matter, as well as in one area of electromagnetism that discusses the emission of radiation from a charged surface. Indeed, the latter concept has been around for more than a century, but is considered by physicists who have studied this special ""charged"" case as one of the most poorly understood in all of physics. Today, this will change as scientists realize the reality of this concept and how it can be used. What all this means is that there is a way in physics to accelerate a charged object in an exponential manner that will permit UFO occupants to reach our planet.Can we build this technology today? You be the judge by reading this intriguing book.

Describing the technologies to combine language resources flexibly as web services, this book provides valuable case studies for those who work in services computing, language resources, human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), and service science. The authors have been operating the Language Grid, which wraps existing language resources as atomic language services and enables users to compose new services by combining them. From architecture level to service composition level, the book explains how to resolve infrastructural and operational difficulties in sharing and combining language resources, including interoperability of language service infrastructures, various types of language service policies, human services, and service failures.The research based on the authors' operating experiences of handling complicated issues such as intellectual property and interoperability of language resources contributes to exploitation of language resources as a service. On the other hand, both the analysis based on using services and the design of new services can bring significant results. A new style of multilingual communication supported by language services is worthy of analysis in HCI/CSCW, and the design process of language services is the focus of valuable case studies in service science. By using language resources in different ways based on the Language Grid, many activities are highly regarded by diverse communities.This book consists of four parts: (1) two types of language service platforms to interconnect language services across service grids, (2) various language service composition technologies that improve the reusability, efficiency, and accuracy of composite services, (3) research work and activities in creating language resources and services, and (4) various applications and tools for understanding and designing language services that well support intercultural collaboration.

	想要打造好用、有效率、令使用者滿意的網站，就需要完善的 UX 設計！
	網站企劃、網站開發者、設計總監、製作人、設計師、工程師……
	網頁設計相關人士必讀的 UX Design 指南

	「UX」是什麼？「UX」是「User eXperience」的縮寫，翻譯為「使用者體驗」。有種說法是，「UX」並非一般所指的產品或服務等「事物」，而是包含事物在內，所謂的環境「狀態」的設計。

	舉例來說，我們以為咖啡店賣的商品（事物）是咖啡，實際上，咖啡的定價中包含了咖啡店內店員的應對、座椅的舒適性、內部裝潢、場所、顧客種類、時間……等全部（狀態）的價值。使用者絕對不是光憑咖啡本身就掏錢，而是購買坐在咖啡店裡喝咖啡的完整體驗。

	同理可知，做為網站設計者，一個網站的好壞也不是光看表面上的操作介面 (UI) 和視覺設計，還有使用者的操作感覺、使用體驗。然而，在網站做出來之前，我們要如何了解使用者的體驗、進而改善網站呢？那就是這本書要教你的事。

	本書由實際在日本大型數位行銷公司 IMJ Corporation 執行 UX 設計的作者群負責執筆，為網站製作者設計了循序漸進的 UX 設計課程。從 UX 設計基礎開始，到「易用性評估」、「製作原型」、「結構化腳本」、「使用者調查」、「顧客旅程地圖」、「塑造使用者形象」、「導入組織」等，共分成 8 章來說明。有鑑於許多企業對 UX 設計不熟悉，或是因預算問題、時程問題而導入困難，作者群皆從經手過的案例來解析，並在書中收錄了實際導入組織時可用的技巧及大小兩個專案模型案例，把現實狀況與實作方法整合在本書中，而不只是紙上談兵。另外，還提供範本下載，讓你不只是理解，也能立刻動手嘗試，是一本可以讓你體驗 UX 設計現場的絕佳參考書。

涵蓋現有流行動態語言（PHP、Python、Perl、Java、Ruby 和ASP.NET）與Nginx伺服器的結合。
透過在生產環境中的具體應用，詳細講述每一種應用伺服器（包括開發架構）的多種不同結合方式。
詳細講述應用程式伺服器的緩存技術，特別是對Memcached伺服器的應用。

	Nginx伺服器在網際網路推波助瀾的作用下脫穎而出，創下了高平行處理的記錄，因此，在短短10年的發展中，在全世界前100萬的網站中，已經有5.1% 的網站使用了Nginx 伺服器，使得Nginx 成為繼Apache（70.2%）和IIS（20.5%）之後的第三大Web 伺服器軟體，而且它的使用數量與日俱增，直逼Apache 的市場。

	Nginx 運作在Linux下，是一個輕量的Http 伺服器。所謂輕量，就是他的安裝設定簡單，佔用系統資源少，能快速處理大量的請求，除了他的「相對」年輕不穩定形象之外，真不知傳統的Apache 或IIS 怎麼和他比。年過20歲的Apache 在10年前，老成穩重的形象似乎比現在也10 歲的Nginx 還要明顯，但10歲時的Apache和現在10 歲的Nginx 比起來，我只能說，穩定又快速、支援的開發語言多，功能又「撈過界」、真的沒有不選Nginx 的理由。

	目前全球Web 伺服器平台，Nginx 已經有超過12% 的佔有率(以域名計算)，全世界有2千2萬百個域名使用Nginx，著名的Github，Wordpress.com 早就使用Nginx 了。

A gripping first-person account of how scientists came to understand our universe's mysterious structureJ. Richard Gott was among the first cosmologists to propose that the structure of our universe is like a sponge made up of clusters of galaxies intricately connected by filaments of galaxies--a magnificent structure now called the cosmic web and mapped extensively by teams of astronomers. Here is his gripping insider's account of how a generation of undaunted theorists and observers solved the mystery of the architecture of our cosmos.The Cosmic Web begins with modern pioneers of extragalactic astronomy, such as Edwin Hubble and Fritz Zwicky. It goes on to describe how, during the Cold War, the American school of cosmology favored a model of the universe where galaxies resided in isolated clusters, whereas the Soviet school favored a honeycomb pattern of galaxies punctuated by giant, isolated voids. Gott tells the stories of how his own path to a solution began with a high-school science project when he was eighteen, and how he and astronomer Mario Jurič measured the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies, a filament of galaxies that, at 1.37 billion light-years in length, is one of the largest structures in the universe.Drawing on Gott's own experiences working at the frontiers of science with many of today's leading cosmologists, The Cosmic Web shows how ambitious telescope surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are transforming our understanding of the cosmos, and how the cosmic web holds vital clues to the origins of the universe and the next trillion years that lie ahead.-- ""Publishers Weekly""

It's no longer enough to make your site easy to learn and use: Web designers need to help their users feel comfortable with every aspect of their site interactions: physical, mental, and emotional. Drawing upon advanced research in psychology and human-computer interfaces -- as well as extensive practical Web design experience -- Albert N. Badre shows precisely how to accomplish this. Badre goes beyond ""mere usability,"" introducing a complete, Web-specialized framework that lets you ""design for context,"" taking into account every aspect of the Web environment. Shaping Web Usability begins by reviewing essential human-computer interaction principles for the Web; then outlines a usability strategy that takes multiple contexts into account: extrinsic design, users, genre, site, and page. Badre offers deep insight into Web users themselves: their skill levels, personalities, and demographics; and presents a full chapter on the unique needs of older Web users. Along the way, he addresses the key issues that make Web usability so challenging, including security and privacy, platform independence, dynamic content, compatibility, and navigation. You'll learn how to ensure that aesthetics and usability complement each other; how to extend usability to handheld devices; and how to evaluate Web usability most effectively. For all Web designers, developers, usability specialists, marketers, and others concerned with the Web user experience.

""A stereotype of computer science textbooks is that they are dry, boring, and sometimes even intimidating. As a result, they turn students' interests off from the subject matter instead of enticing them into it. This textbook is the opposite of such a stereotype. The author presents the subject matter in a refreshing story-telling style and aims to bring the Internet-generation of students closer to her stories.""　--Yingcai Xiao, The University of AkronIntroduction to Middleware: Web Services, Object Components, and Cloud Computing provides a comparison of different middleware technologies and the overarching middleware concepts they are based on. The various major paradigms of middleware are introduced and their pros and cons are discussed. This includes modern cloud interfaces, including the utility of Service Oriented Architectures. The text discusses pros and cons of RESTful vs. non-RESTful web services, and also compares these to older but still heavily used distributed object/component middleware. The text guides readers to select an appropriate middleware technology to use for any given task, and to learn new middleware technologies as they appear over time without being greatly overwhelmed by any new concept. The book begins with an introduction to different distributed computing paradigms, and a review of the different kinds of architectures, architectural styles/patterns, and properties that various researchers have used in the past to examine distributed applications and determine the quality of distributed applications. Then it includes appropriate background material in networking and the web, security, and encoding necessary to understand detailed discussion in this area. The major middleware paradigms are compared, and a comparison methodology is developed. Readers will learn how to select a paradigm and technology for a particular task, after reading this text.Detailed middleware technology review sections allow students or industry practitioners working to expand their knowledge to achieve practical skills based on real projects so as to become well-functional in that technology in industry. Major technologies examined include: RESTful web services (RESTful cloud interfaces such as OpenStack, AWS EC2 interface, CloudStack; AJAX, JAX-RS, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core), non-RESTful (SOAP and WSDL-based) web services (JAX-WS, Windows Communication Foundation), distributed objects/ components (Enterprise Java Beans, .NET Remoting, CORBA).The book presents two projects that can be used to illustrate the practical use of middleware, and provides implementations of these projects over different technologies.This versatile and class-tested textbook is suitable (depending on chapters selected) for undergraduate or first-year graduate courses on client server architectures, middleware, and cloud computing, web services, and web programming.

The first successful field theory was created by the Scottish Physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the mid -19th century - the electromagnetic field theory. Then in the early 1900s, Einstein spent 30yrs of his life developing a unified field theory but all in vain. One limitation with Einstein's work was at first his rejection, and then his ignorance of quantum theory. Einstein was motivated by an intellectual need to unify the forces of nature. He felt very strongly that all of nature must be described by a simple force field theory from which all other forces can be deduced. In principle, if one had the formula of a Unified field theory at hand, it would be possible to derive every other natural law from them, including all the laws of physics, chemistry, even molecular biology. Without the use of the mathematics of the standard model and the notions of Einstein's general relativity theory, we postulate a single force field equation from which all other physics laws are derived.

Investigating the complex nature of environmental problems requires the integration of different environmental processes across major components of the environment. Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) not only includes analyzing and modelling environmental changes, but also supports planning alternatives that promote environmental monitoring and management.The adoption of integrated modelling approaches requires the development of frameworks which may be used to investigate individual environmental processes and their interactions with each other. Integrated modelling systems and frameworks are often the only way to examine important environmental processes and interactions, relevant spatial and temporal scales, and feedback mechanisms of complex systems for CEA.This book examines the ways in which interactions and relationships between environmental components are understood, paying special attention to climate, land, water quantity and quality, and both anthropogenic and natural stressors. It reviews modelling approaches for each component and existing integrated modelling systems for CEA. Finally, it proposes an integrated modelling framework and provides perspectives on future research avenues for cumulative effects assessment.

Praise for The Complete Website Planning Guide A great, accessible and practical guide that you can quickly use to get better results from your next website build. Get to it!Would you build a house without blueprints and expect it to be perfect?That's how many people go about their web projects, with napkin drawings, spoken discussions, part finished summaries and guides and wonder why it's not finished on time, costs more than it should and people aren't happy with it.You can be the architect of your next website project and avoid delays, scope creep, missing functionality and extra costs.In The Complete Website Planning Guide you can learn how to easily create blueprints (a scope) for your, or your clients, website that will solve many of the key problems that occur in website development projects.After more than 20 years running a design and development agency Darryl still couldn't find a standard way that clients and developers could outline exactly what they needed to get the job done most effectively. Most briefs or planning methods either focus on general things like platform, hosting and general design guidelines. Many agencies or freelancers still fly by the seat of their pants using their experience to guide the project.So he wrote this guidebook as an instruction manual to create useful site plans without missing out important requirements, or needing to be overly technical.In this simple step-by-step guide he walks you through the process of establishing what the website really needs to do and shows you how to do it.If you want to build your next website before you pick a theme and try to wedge your needs into it, before you tell your designer to copy someone else's site read this book and create your website plan.If you are a freelancer or agency developer don't take on a client or quote a new project without helping them plan the site properly.Learn how to create a plan so you can avoid overruns, scope creep and lost money.This is the very first step you need for your next web project, download the free templates and resources, and join the facebook group where you can get advice on working through your own plan.  And now you can also buy the companion Complete Website Planning Guide Workbook to use side by side with this book.What readers said: ""If you are a business owner, read it, print out the templates and have these discussions with your designers. Trust me, even if you do only a few things in this guide, your outcome will be 100% better than if you just choose your site based on the pretty colours."" Ed Pelgen""I am a freelancer and this is what I was looking for. Darryl has used his experience in laying out the problems faced by clients and freelancers and also given some templates and methods to follow before starting a new project"" Amrinder Singh

The Georgia Pest Management Handbook provides current information on selection, application, and safe use of pest control chemicals. This handbook has recommendations for pest control around homes and on pets; for pests of home garden vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals; and for pests of public health interest associated with our homes. Cultural, biological, physical, and other types of control are recommended where appropriate. Pesticide recommendations are based on information on the manufacturer labels and on performance data from research and extension trials at the University of Georgia and its sister institutions. Because environmental conditions, the severity of pest pressure, and methods of application vary widely, recommendations do not imply that performance of pesticides will always be acceptable. This publication is intended to be used only as a guide. Trade and brand names are used only for information. The University of Georgia does not guarantee nor warrant published standards on any product mentioned; nor does the use of a trade or brand name imply approval of any product to the exclusion of others that may also be suitable.

Foreword While Mobile Communications continues to be a very successful industry, the number of s- cessful mobile applications still seems to be limited. Certainly, mobile voice and email are attractive to more and more customers. However especially during the boom around the UMTS license auctions much more fancy mobile applications were discussed, sometimes seen implemented - but never really widely used. Often high costs, especially compared to the costs of the ""fixed"" Internet, were given as r- sons for this. But considering the prices businesses, and more and more private people, pay for mobile voice and email connectivity, other reasons must exist for the reluctance to use mobile applications. One reason seems to be that quite a few people are not convinced, that mobile access or receiving information on a mobile device adds value. More formally spe- ing, usefulness or a relative advantage are not perceived, especially when the ones receiving the information are busy decision makers, who have other things to do. Especially when c- fronted with the still existing weaknesses of mobile devices, e. g. their limited I/O-capabilities they may see mobile work as mobile stress with no sustainable use.

Whether you need a new tool or just inspiration, Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks explores modern options, giving you a taste of each with ideas that will help you create better apps. You'll see frameworks that leverage modern programming languages, employ unique architectures, live client-side instead of server-side, or embrace type systems. You'll see everything from familiar Ruby and JavaScript to the more exotic Erlang, Haskell, and Clojure.  The rapid evolution of web apps demands innovative solutions: this survey of frameworks and their unique perspectives will inspire you and get you thinking in new ways to meet the challenges you face daily.  This book covers seven web frameworks that are influencing modern web applications and changing web development: Sinatra, CanJS, AngularJS, Ring, Webmachine, Yesod, Immutant. Each of these web frameworks brings unique and powerful ideas to bear on building apps.  Embrace the simplicity of Sinatra, which sheds the trappings of large frameworks and gets back to basics with Ruby. Live in the client with CanJS, and create apps with JavaScript in the browser. Be declarative with AngularJS; say what you want, not how to do it, with a mixture of declarative HTML and JavaScript. Turn the web into data with Ring, and use Clojure to make data your puppet. Become a master of advanced HTTP with Webmachine, and focus the power of Erlang. Prove web theorems with Yesod; see how Haskell's advanced type system isn't just for academics. Develop in luxury with Immutant, an enlightened take on the enterprise framework. Seven Web Frameworks will influence your work, no matter which framework you currently use.  Welcome to a wider web. What You Need:   You'll need Windows, MacOS X or Linux, along with your favorite web browser. Each chapter will cover what you need to download and which language versions are required.

 Nginx（engine x）是俄羅斯人Igor Sysoev 撰寫的一款高性能的HTTP 和反向代理伺服器。Nginx 選擇了epoll 和kqueue 作為網路I/O 模型，在高連接並行的情況下，Nginx 是Apache 伺服器不錯的替代品，它能夠支援高達50,000 個並行連接數的回應，執行穩定，且記憶體、CPU 等系統資源消耗非常低。


 除了少數具有開發能力的公司之外，商業網站架設就是二選一，Linux 陣營Apache，Windows 選IIS，長久以來，這兩個產品霸佔了90% 以上的Web 伺服器市場。在選完邊後，我們也忙著偵錯、校調，最佳化、設定，設計這個既定的架構，不斷的找資料，問專家，想方案，以應付日益龐大及複雜的應用環境。


 但是，有沒有其它的選擇，讓我們一開始就不需要煩惱已經可預見的問題？


 Apache 如其名，一開始當然是一個以「補丁(patch，英文發音接近)」為主的Web 伺服器。但在「自由軟體」的加持下，與身處相對較穩定的類Unix 環境中，自然受「較高級」工程師寵愛。但這個對於Windows 系統的虛榮優勢，在同處於類Unix 環境的其它產品中不見得能佔到便宜。Nginx 這個後起之秀的網頁伺服器，在Linux 環境下，讓Apache 馬上降級成面對夢幻隊的板凳球員。


 許多知名公司在招聘系統工程師、網路工程師時，都會加上對Nginx 設定管理經驗的要求。Nginx 作為新興的Web 伺服器，發展趨勢迅猛，已經在眾多知名網站的各項產品中取代Apache。但是，Nginx 相關的中文資料卻比較欠缺，本書就是為對Nginx 伺服器實作應用感興趣的讀者準備的。


 雲端時代進入高原期，虛擬化在底層已完全成熟，上層的平台是否還有進步空間不得而知，但能讓同樣硬體發揮5-10倍效能的軟體，相信你也會忍不住想試試。學習Nginx 也許無法讓你立即高人一等，但換個完全相容又更強大的產品，而無需陡峭的學習曲線，怎麼看都是蠻酷的一件事。

In Newton's view, all objects exert a force that attracts other objects. That universal law of gravitation worked pretty well for predicting the motion of planets as well as objects on Earth and it's still used, for example, when making the calculations for a rocket launch. But Newton's view of gravity didn't work for some things, like Mercury's peculiar orbit around the sun. The orbits of planets shift over time, and Mercury's orbit shifted faster than Newton predicted.Einstein's idea was that gravity is not a force, but it is really an effect caused by the curvature of space and time. Although all its predictions have almost been confirmed by experiment, General relativity fails to explain details near space time singularities at the centre of Black holes and the mysterious dark matter. Which means Einstein equations cannot explain the motion of stars in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Mordehai Milgrom MOND explains the motion of stars in galaxies correctly without assuming Dark matter. Therefore MOND is an alternative to Newton's law of Universal gravitation. However the most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems.Most theorists believe that gravitons must exist, and that they could be candidates for Dark matter, because quantum theory has successfully explained every other force of nature. But not everyone agrees. No theory claiming to unify quantum theory with GR has been successfully verified, and this has raised suspicions that perhaps gravity isn't like any other force - in which case gravitons may not exist. The theory of quantum gravity is expected to be able to provide a satisfactory description of the microstructure of space time at the so called Planck scales, at which all fundamental constants of the ingredient theories, c (speed of light), h ( Planck constant) and G ( Newton's constant), come together to form units of mass, length and time. The search for the full theory of quantum gravity has been stymied by the fact that gravity's quantum properties never seem to manifest in actual experience. One option for a solution to this conundrum is string theory, or the idea that everything we perceive as a particle or force is simply an excitation of a closed or open string, vibrating at specific but unique frequencies. One of the major criticisms of string theory has to do not with the theory so much as with theorists. Not only that, the strings of string theory are stupendously small, thought to be somewhere around the Planck scale, a bare 10-34 meters across. That's far, far smaller than anything we can possibly hope to probe even with our most precise instruments. The strings are so small, in fact, that they appear to us to be point-like particles, such as electrons and photons and neutrons. We simply can't ever stare at a string directly.Therefore emergent gravity or entropic gravity is a theory in modern physics that describes gravity as an entropic force, a force with macro-scale homogeneity but which is subject to quantum level disorder and not a fundamental interaction.The theory has been controversial within the physics community but has sparked research and experiments to test its validity. The problem is, if emergent gravity just reproduces General Relativity, there's no way to test the idea. What we need instead is a prediction from emergent gravity that deviates from General Relativity.Finally when all is said and done, the fifth force is proposed and its first result is that it reproduces the MOND and Emergent gravity results from one single force equation and solves all gravitational problems leaving none untouched. Although it is accurate there is one problem; it can't explain the origin of gravity.Gravity is then fixed by postulating that it is as a result of the Casimir effect due to vacuum polarizations with sounding experimental proof. This book will help you fix Gravity.

In Newton's view, all objects exert a force that attracts other objects. That universal law of gravitation worked pretty well for predicting the motion of planets as well as objects on Earth and it's still used, for example, when making the calculations for a rocket launch. But unfortunately it cannot be derived from first principles.While Newton was able to formulate his law of gravity in his monumental work, he was deeply uncomfortable with the notion of ""action at a distance"" that his equations implied. In 1692, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote:  ""That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it."" He never, in his words, ""assigned the cause of this power"". In all other cases, he used the phenomenon of motion to explain the origin of various forces acting on bodies, but in the case of gravity, he was unable to experimentally identify the motion that produces the force of gravity. Moreover, he refused to even offer a hypothesis as to the cause of this force on grounds that to do so was contrary to sound science. He lamented that ""philosophers have hitherto attempted the search of nature in vain"" for the source of the gravitational force, as he was convinced ""by many reasons"" that there were ""causes hitherto unknown"" that were fundamental to all the ""phenomena of nature"". These fundamental phenomena are still under investigation and, though hypotheses abound, the definitive answer has yet to be found. ""I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena and I feign no hypotheses.... It is enough that gravity does really exist and acts according to the laws I have explained, and that it abundantly serves to account for all the motions of celestial bodies."" Newton In this book gravity has been derived from first principles without any assumptions. What has been believed to be a fundamental force for years can actually be derived from first principles has this book explains. The derivation is simple and straight foward. The experiment to the derivation has also been proposed. This book will help us rethink Physics.

除了少數具有開發能力的公司之外，由於歷史因素和使用習慣，商業網站架設就是二選一，Linux 陣營Apache，Windows 選IIS，長久以來，這兩個產品當然霸佔了90% 以上的Web 伺服器市場，在選完邊之後，我們也忙著偵錯、校調，最佳化、設定，設計這個既定的架構，不斷的找資料，問專家，想方案，以應付日益龐大及複雜的應用環境。　　但是，有沒有其它的選擇，讓我們從一開始就不需要煩惱已經可預見的問題？　　Apache 如其名，一開始當然是一個以「補丁(patch，英文發音接近)」為主的Web 伺服器。但在「自由軟體」的加持下，再加上身處相對較穩定的類Unix 環境中，自然成為「較高級」工程師的寵愛。但這個對於Windows 系統的虛榮優勢，在同處於類Unix 環境的其它產品中不見得能佔什麼便宜。Nginx 這個後起之秀的網頁伺服器，在Linux 環境下，讓Apache 馬上降級成面對夢幻隊的板凳球員。　　Nginx（“engine x”）是俄羅斯人Igor Sysoev 撰寫的一款高性能的HTTP 和反向代理伺服器。Nginx 選擇了epoll 和kqueue 作為網路I/O 模型，在高連接並行的情況下，Nginx 是Apache 伺服器不錯的替代品，它能夠支援高達50,000 個並行連接數的回應，執行穩定，且記憶體、CPU 等系統資源消耗非常低。　　近期，許多知名網際網路公司的系統工程師、網路工程師招聘資訊中，都加上了一條對Nginx 設定管理經驗的要求。Nginx 作為新興的Web 伺服器，目前的發展趨勢迅猛，已經在眾多知名網站的各項產品中取代Apache。但是，Nginx 相關的中文資料卻比較欠缺，本書就是為對Nginx 伺服器實作應用感興趣的讀者準備的，適用於以前沒有接觸過Nginx，或者對Nginx 有一些了解並希望能夠進一步深入，以及對Nginx 有較多研究，希望共同探討的專業系統工程師、個人網站站長及一切Linux/Unix 從業人員。　　雲端時代進入高原期，虛擬化在底層已完全成熟，上層的平台是否還有進步空間不得而知，但能讓同樣硬體發揮5-10倍效能的軟體，相信你也會忍不住想試試。台灣叢薾小國若不放眼全球市場，不是Thomas Friedman 眼中「創意加工」型的人，遲早會成為扁平世界3.0 的泡沫，學習Nginx 也許無法讓你立即高人一等，但換個完全相容又更強大的產品，而無需陡峭的學習曲線，怎麼看都是蠻酷的一件事。

Natural environments provide enormously valuable, but largely unappreciated, services that aid humans and other earthlings. It is becoming clear that these life-support systems are faltering and failing worldwide due to human actions that disrupt nature's ability to do its beneficial work.  Ecosystem Services: Charting a Path to Sustainability documents the National Academies' Keck Futures Initiative Conference on Ecosystem Services. At this conference, participants were divided into 14 interdisciplinary research teams to explore diverse challenges at the interface of science, engineering, and medicine. The teams needed to address the challenge of communicating and working together from a diversity of expertise and perspectives as they attempted to solve a complicated, interdisciplinary problem in a relatively short time. Ecosystem Services: Charting a Path to Sustainability describes how ecosystem services scientists work to document the direct and indirect links between humanity's well-being and the many benefits provided by the natural systems we occupy.  This report explains the specific topics the interdisciplinary research teams addressed at the conference, including the following:   -how ecosystem services affect infectious and chronic diseases -how to identify what resources can be produced renewably or recovered by developing intense technologies that can be applied on a massive scale -how to develop social and technical capabilities to respond to abrupt changes in ecosystem services -how to design agricultural and aquacultural systems that provide food security while maintaining the full set of ecosystem services needed from landscapes and seascapes -how to design production systems for ecosystem services that improve human outcomes related to food and nutrition -how to develop appropriate methods to accurately value natural capital and ecosystem services -how to design a federal policy to maintain or improve natural capital and ecosystem services within the United States, including measuring and documenting the effectiveness of the policy -how to design a system for international trade that accounts for impacts on ecosystem services -how to develop a program that increases the American public's appreciation of the basic principles of ecosystem services

Developing applications for Android and other mobile devices using web technologies is now well within reach. When the capabilities of HTML5 are combined with CSS3 and JavaScript, web application developers have an opportunity to develop compelling mobile applications using familiar tools. Not only is it possible to build mobile web apps that feel as good as native apps, but to also write an application once and have it run a variety of different devices.  While the HTML5 specification is still evolving, there is a lot that can be used right now to build mobile web apps. Mobile web apps are now starting to provide many of the features that were once only available to native-language-based apps in Java, Objective-C, etc. Pro Android Web Apps teaches developers already familiar with web application development, how to code and structure a web app for use on the Android mobile platform.

Since it was developed, Newton's law of gravitation and many other laws of physics cannot be derived from one grand underlying principle. Deriving Newton's law of gravitation or Einstein general relativity theory, would mean that gravity emerges from something else and that would mean that the only known Newton's law of universal gravity is no longer a fundamental law of physics.Although this might be true, I believe that everything must have an origin. I believe that there is a fundamental universal physical law from which all other known physical laws can be deduced. I also believe that the laws of physics are not picked at random but there exists an underlying principle from which they can be derived with ease. Failure for some minds to grasp this principle doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Because I was used to deriving and proving formulae in pure math, I didn't like the way the laws of physics were presented to me without proof. A physics tutor would just write down a set of physical laws without proof. There are so many physics books which still do the same thing.Being curious and passionate to finding out how I couldderive all the laws of physics from one single equation is proof that this book would have never existed in the first place if had not discovered the hidden principle that underlies all physics.

People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where did we come from? How did the universe begin? What is the meaning and design behind it all? Is there anyone out there? The creation accounts of the past now seem less relevant and credible. They have been replaced by a variety of what can only be called superstitions, ranging from New Age to Star Trek. But real science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more satisfying. I am a scientist. And a scientist with a deep fascination with physics, cosmology, the universe and the future of humanity. I was brought up by my parents to have an unwavering curiosity and, like my father, to research and try to answer the many questions that science asks us. I have spent my life travelling across the universe, inside my mind. Through theoretical physics, I have sought to answer some of the great questions. At one point, I thought I would see the end of physics as we know it, but now I think the wonder of discovery will continue long after I am gone. We are close to some of these answers, but we are not there yet. The problem is, most people believe that real science is too difficult and complicated for them to understand. But I don't think this is the case. To do research on the fundamental laws that govern the universe would require a commitment of time that most people don't have; the world would soon grind to a halt if we all tried to do theoretical physics. But most people can understand and appreciate the basic ideas if they are presented in a clear way with equations, which I believe is possible and which is something I have enjoyed trying to do throughout my life. It has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. Our picture of the universe has changed a great deal in the last fifty years, and I'm happy if I have made a contribution. One of the great revelations of the space age has been the perspective it has given humanity on ourselves. When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race. I want to add my voice to those who demand why we must ask the big questions immediate action on the key challenges for our global community. I hope that going forward, even when I am no longer here, people with power can show creativity, courage and leadership. Let them rise to the challenge of the sustainable development goals, and act, not out of self-interest, but out of common interest. I am very aware of the preciousness of time. Seize the moment. Act now.

I believe in the W3C's principle of One Web--that services and information on the web should be thematically consistent and accessible to all kinds of devices, without regard to differences in presentation capabilities. Informally, the One Web principle means that if I write my grocery list online at home in Firefox, I should be able to view the list and check off my purchases at the grocery store using my mobile phone. That said, the Mobile Web and its ecosystem are unique in many ways--in access patterns, user behaviors, browser technologies, and client capabilities. A recent mobiThinking report coined the maxim ""utility is the engine of the Mobile Web"". This phrase has become my mantra for Mobile Web development and I encourage you to adopt it as well. Mobile Web content succeeds when it solves a real problem for a user on the move. Driving directions, public transportation, business listings, news headlines, social networking, and banking are all examples of content that succeeds on the Mobile Web because real people using mobile phones in their daily lives find this information to be relevant, local, and immediately available.

You hold in your hands a recipe book. With clear examples and no wasted words, designer Dan Cederholm shows how to put web standards to work creating beautiful, lightweight interfaces that are accessible to all. Dan isn't here to make the creative or business case for standards-based web design. Others (cough) have already done that. And frankly, if you've bothered to pick up this book and thumb through its pages, you probably already know the accessibility, longevity, and business benefits standards-based design provides. You don't need another overview or elevator pitch; you need a practical, roll-up-your-sleeves, component view, and that's what this book delivers. In down-to-earth, natural language--the same kind of language that's found on good websites-- Dan examines universal site elements such as page divisions and navigation. Using a teaching method he pioneered at SimpleBits.com, Dan shows how web standards make these universal page components easier to create, easier to modify when your boss or client requests la- minute changes, and most important of all, easier for people to use.

Web 2.0 is more pervasive than ever, with business analysts and technologists struggling to comprehend the opportunity it represents. So what exactly is Web 2.0 -- a marketing term or technical reality? This fascinating book finally puts substance behind the phenomenon by identifying the core patterns of Web 2.0, and by introducing an abstract model and reference architecture to help you take advantage of them.  In Web 2.0 Architectures, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor -- who have 40 years of combined experience with technical specifications and industry trends -- examine what makes successful Web 2.0 services such as Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia work. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.  This book reveals:  A Web 2.0 model:  How the classic Client-Server model evolved into a more detailed Web 2.0 model. Web 2.0 reference architecture:  A generic component view of basic Web 2.0 patterns that can be repurposed for other commercial ventures. Specific Web 2.0 patterns:  How service oriented architecture (SOA), Software as a Service (SaaS), participation-collaboration, mashups, rich user experience, collaborative tagging systems (Folksonomy), and more can be used in your business.  If you want to understand what makes Web 2.0 tick, and how it will enhance your business, Web 2.0 Architectures takes you right to the core.

How many times have you seen a web site and said, ""This would be exactly what I wanted-- if only . . . "" If only you could combine the statistics here with data from your company's earnings projections. If only you could take the addresses for those restaurants and plot them on one map. How often have you entered the date of a concert into your calendar with a single click instead of retyping? How often do you wish that you could make all the different parts of your digital world--your e-mail, your word processor documents, your photos, your search results, your maps, your presentations--work together more seamlessly? After all, it's all digital and malleable information--shouldn't it all just fit together? In fact, below the surface, all the data, web sites, and applications you use could fit together. This book teaches you how to forge those latent connections--to make the Web your own--by remixing information to create your own mashups. A mashup, in the words of the Wikipedia, is a web site or web application ""that seamlessly combines content from more than one source 1 into an integrated experience. "" Learning how to draw content from the Web together into new integrated interfaces and applications, whether for yourself or for other others, is the central concern of this book.

When I quit my day job in the summer of 2006 to bring an idea of mine to life as an Internet startup, I was faced with a huge number of questions and not a lot of clear answers. The excitement of starting a new project was soon tempered by the difficulty of choosing among the dizzying array of possible technical platforms and solutions. While the shelves were full of books focusing on each of the components of a web application, what I really wanted was a look at how all the pieces fit together. Too often, I found books that seemed like annotated versions of Javadocs, with he- ful explanatory notes that setEnabled(boolean enabled) would set the enabled flag. At the other end of the spectrum were abstract architectural tracts that might have made for good reading but certainly didn't give me a head start on the architecture. I wanted to see how these technologies worked when used for nontrivial applications; I wanted to see ugly problems and their solutions--I wanted a look at the source code of a modern web application.

Over the last couple of years, we've noticed that our customers have gotten more demanding when it comes to the usability of their web applications. Inspired by the ""web 2.0"" trend and applications such as Gmail and the like, we've tried many approaches to building these rich Internet applications (RIAs). But all of these had one big flaw: they required us to learn a different language, including adhering to a whole new set of conventions and best practices. Only with the introduction of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) have we begun to feel confident about building this kind of application in a maintainable fashion. This book introduces GWT within the context just described, and will guide you through the first steps of using it to build real-world applications. The goal is to get you as a Java developer up to speed quickly by providing just enough background and a lot of hands-on code samples. During the course of the book, we'll guide you through the different aspects of GWT that we feel are important, and leave out the ones we feel are out-of-scope for beginners. Most of the code samples will gradually build to make up a real-world sample application that allows you to manage your tasks using a web application. After reading this book, you'll be equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to start building real-world applications using GWT.

The Challenge of Accessibility When Tim Berners-Lee created the Web, he had some very specific goals in mind. Certainly, creating a technology that allowed the sharing of information was a main part of that goal, but an interesting piece of Berners-Lee's vision has always had to do with the human side of the Web. After all, it's not machines that use the Web, but people. Accessibility has become a hot topic in web design, despite the fact that it has always been a part of the original vision. In a broad sense, accessibility simply means ensuring that a given page on the Web is able to be accessed. Accessibility is not about disability; rather, it's about people getting to the shared information that the vision of the Web has made manifest. There has also been a lot said about how accessibility relates to web standards and vice versa. Realistically, accessibility relies on aspects of related web standards, but has in fact become a science, art, and practice of its own. It's a deep specialty, and one that is highly problematic, as what might make a page accessible to one person could conceivably render it inaccessible to another.

Many of today's web development books and articles cover single aspects of the development life cycle, delving only into specific features rather than looking at the whole picture. In this book, we will develop a complete web application. Although we will be using various third-party libraries and tools to aid in development, we will be developing the application from start to finish. The focus of this book is on Web 2. 0, a catchphrase that has been in use for a few years now and is typically used to refer to web sites or web applications that have particular char- teristics. Some of these characteristics include the following: - Correctly using HTML/XHTML, CSS, and other standards - Using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to provide a responsive application without requiring a full refresh of pages - Allowing syndication of web site content using RSS - Adding wikis, blogs, or tags Although not everybody is an advocate of the ""Web 2. 0"" phrase, the term does signify forward progress in web development. And although not everybody has the need to provide a wiki or a blog on their web site, the other characteristics listed (such as correct standards usage) provide a good basis for a web site and should be used by all developers, regardless of how they want their web site or application categorized. I wrote this book because I want to share with other users how I build web sites.

As a web user, you'll no doubt have noticed some of the breathtaking applications available in today's modern web, such as Google Maps and Flickrdesktop applications than the old style web sites you are used to. You've probably also wished that you could create such things, and then thought ""nahhh, I'd need to know a lot of complicated code to be able to even start creating sites like these."" Well, think again.There is a lot of complicated code involved in cutting-edge ""Ajax-style"" web applications, but a lot of the hard work is already done for you, and available on the Web. JavaScript libraries exist to provide most of that Ajax/DOM Scripting functionality out of the box. Application programming interfaces (APIs) exist to allow you to transplant complicated applications such as Google Maps and Flickr right into your own web sites. And hosting services such as Flickr and YouTube provide all you need to store and retrieve your media (be it images, video, or whatever) at your leisure, without having to worry about bandwidth issues and file naming nightmares.All you need to know is enough to successfully wire together all this functionality successfully and responsibly, and this book shows you how. It starts from the very beginning of your journey, showing you what's available, what you need, and how to set up an effective development environment. After a solid base has been built, it shows you how to build up each aspect of your site, including storing, retrieving, and displaying content, adding images and video to your site, building effective site navigation and laying it all out beautifully using CSS, promoting your content so you will attract visitors to your site, and adding special effects to enhance usability and design asthetics...all with ready-made functionality available on the Web! Life as a web developer has never been easier.

Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines.  The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process.  Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book's companion web site. The rules include how to:  Make Fewer HTTP Requests Use a Content Delivery Network Add an Expires Header Gzip Components Put Stylesheets at the Top Put Scripts at the Bottom Avoid CSS Expressions Make JavaScript and CSS External Reduce DNS Lookups Minify JavaScript Avoid Redirects Remove Duplicates Scripts Configure ETags Make Ajax Cacheable  If you're building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable.  ""If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve's guidelines, the Web would be a dramatically better place. Between this book and Steve's YSlow extension, there's really no excuse for having a sluggish web site anymore.""  -Joe Hewitt, Developer of Firebug debugger and Mozilla's DOM Inspector  ""Steve Souders has done a fantastic job of distilling a massive, semi-arcane art down to a set of concise, actionable, pragmatic engineering steps that will change the world of web performance.""  -Eric Lawrence, Developer of the Fiddler Web Debugger, Microsoft Corporation

Designing for the Web is a wonderful thing. The ability to publish something and have it appear immediately and globally is an empowering feeling. I'll never forget the first rush I felt when, as a print designer, I could simply ""upload"" some files and have them be immediately visible, rather than waiting in trepidation for the boxes to return from the printer. Back then the Web was simpler, there were fewer materials and tools, and ""styling"" was something you hacked together using bizarre hacks and workarounds to achieve even the simplest of tasks. The browser landscape was equally testing. Now we're in a much better position. We have a wonderful thing called CSS that allows us to style pages with concise style rules and leave the HTML to describe the content, not the pr- entation. Content can be repurposed for different media. But anyone keen to learn web design (from scratch, or to improve their existing skills) has a bewildering job on their hands. The publishing market is saturated with good books on web design, HTML, and CSS.

""The Bartlett's provide a convenient identification guide and reference manual for the reptiles and amphibians most likely to be encountered by visitors to the Amazon basin. It will be of great interest to ecotourists and herpetological hobbyists, and the basic natural history information will be useful to professional biologists who are not specialists in the taxa covered in the book.""--Paul E. Moler, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Though travel to the Amazon Basin once was accessible only to the most intrepid explorer, today the region is a popular destination for scores of ecotourists, visitors who are likely to observe 50 species of reptiles and amphibians in just a weeklong trip. Until publication of this illustrated field guide, no book has been available to help identify these delightful, stunning, and sometimes venomous creatures. This handbook offers a colorful, easy-to-use guide to more than 250 of the snakes, lizards, turtles, frogs, and salamanders common to the Amazonian regions of Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Colombia. From brightly colored frogs so small they fit on a thumbnail to large poisonous snakes camouflaged by green and brown patterned skin, it features all the more frequently seen species as well as types that are less common, and it also provides basic natural history information. Clear close-up photos accompany text that describes appearance, range, size, and color and lists similar species. For many years the authors have led tours to the rainforest. They travel remote rivers on small boats, bunk in tents pitched on sleeping platforms, and walk seldom-trodden trails, usually finding a herpetologic species new to them on each trip. At times, they were hard-pressed to identify the species they photographed; their fellow travelers have found the task even more difficult. For those who want to attach names and information to their natural surroundings, this new field guide will open up the beautiful and mysterious world of herpetofauna. In addition, students of rainforest ecology will find useful information about the infinite variety of rainforest adaptations, and hobbyists will appreciate hard-to-find information about imported specimens.R.D. Bartlett is the author of many books, including In Search of Reptiles and Amphibians and Popular Boas and Pythons, and has published more than 500 articles about herpetology in such magazines as Tropical Fish Hobbyist, Reptiles, and Reptile and Amphibian. Patricia Bartlett is the coauthor with R.D. Bartlett of numerous books, including A Field Guide to Florida Reptiles and Amphibians. Together they have led herpetology photography tours to many areas of the Amazon Basin.

To achieve success in today's ever-changing and unpredictable markets, competitive businesses need to rethink and reframe their strategies across the board. Instead of approaching new product development from the inside out, companies have to begin by looking at the process from the outside in, beginning with the customer experience. It's a new way of thinking-and working-that can transform companies struggling to adapt to today's environment into innovative, agile, and commercially successful organizations.Companies must develop a new set of organizational competencies: qualitative customer research to better understand customer behaviors and motivations; an open design process to reframe possibilities and translate new ideas into great customer experiences; and agile technological implementation to quickly prototype ideas, getting them from the whiteboard out into the world where people can respond to them.In Subject to Change: Creating Great Products and Services for an Uncertain World, Adaptive Path, a leading experience strategy and design company, demonstrates how successful businesses can-and should-use customer experiences to inform and shape the product development process, from start to finish.

Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.  Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.  The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:  Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.  There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.

In order to establish and then maintain a successful presence on the Web, designing a creative site is only half the battle. What good is an intricate Web infrastructure if you're unable to measure its effectiveness? That's why every business is desperate for feedback on their site's visitors: Who are they? Why do they visit? What information or service is most valuable to them?  Unfortunately, most common Web analytics software applications are long on functionality and short on documentation. Without clear guidance on how these applications should be integrated into the greater Web strategy, these often expensive investments go underused and underappreciated.  Enter Web Site Measurement Hacks, a guidebook that helps you understand your Web site visitors and how they contribute to your business's success. It helps organizations and individual operators alike make the most of their Web investment by providing tools, techniques, and strategies for measuring--and then improving--their site's usability, performance, and design. Among the many topics covered, you'll learn: definitions of commonly used terms, such as ""key performance indicators"" (KPIs) how to drive potential customers to action how to gather crucial marketing and customer data which features are useful and which are superfluous advanced techniques that senior Web site analysts use on a daily basis By examining how real-world companies use analytics to their success, Web Site Measurement Hacks demonstrates how you, too, can accurately measure your Web site's overall effectiveness. Just as importantly, it bridges the gulf between the technical teams charged with maintaining your Web's infrastructure and the business teams charged with making management decisions.  It's the technology companion that every site administrator needs.

""Ryan Barnett has raised the bar in terms of running Apache securely. If you run Apache, stop right now and leaf through this book; you need this information."" -- Stephen Northcutt, The SANS Institute The only end-to-end guide to securing Apache Web servers and Web applications Apache can be hacked. As companies have improved perimeter security, hackers have increasingly focused on attacking Apache Web servers and Web applications. Firewalls and SSL won't protect you: you must systematically harden your Web application environment. Preventing Web Attacks with Apache brings together all the information you'll need to do that: step-by-step guidance, hands-on examples, and tested configuration files. Building on his groundbreaking SANS presentations on Apache security, Ryan C. Barnett reveals why your Web servers represent such a compelling target, how significant exploits are performed, and how they can be defended against. Exploits discussed include: buffer overflows, denial of service, attacks on vulnerable scripts and programs, credential sniffing and spoofing, client parameter manipulation, brute force attacks, web defacements, and more. Barnett introduces the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmarks, a set of best-practice Apache security configuration actions and settings he helped to create. He addresses issues related to IT processes and your underlying OS; Apache downloading, installation, and configuration; application hardening; monitoring, and more. He also presents a chapter-length case study using actual Web attack logs and data captured ""in the wild."" For every sysadmin, Web professional, and security specialist responsible for Apache or Web application security. With this book, you will learn to * Address the OS-related flaws most likely to compromise Web server security * Perform security-related tasks needed to safely download, configure, and install Apache * Lock down your Apache httpd.conf file and install

A practical and concise book that teaches XML from the ground up. This tutorial style presents various XML methodologies and techniques in an easy to understand way, building a basis for further exploration.XML is essentially an enabling technology, dry and boring on its own. As a result, most books on the market are dry, and academic in nature teaching theory rather than practice. This book actually teaches practical, real-world applications of XML, using the very latest version of PHP (PHP 5) as the base language .No Nonsense XML Web Development with PHP explains how XML can be put to use in real-world projects. The book also covers buzz topics such as RSS and Web Services. From the PublisherIf ever there were a candidate for ""Most Hyped Technology' it would be Extensible Markup Language (XML). 'No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP' cuts through the hype and shows you how to get the most of this powerful, multifaceted technology.No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP dispenses with the theoretical possibilities of XML and presents real, practical uses of XML that you can apply to your existing Websites today. The book will teach you, step-by-step, exactly how to: Create a full-blown Content Management System (CMS) based on XML.Create a dynamic site map using XSLT.Generate XML feeds (including RSS) for your Website.Facilitate transfer of important information between disparate systems using XML-RPCUse the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate documents.Rapidly process XML using PHP 5.0's built-in SimpleXML functionality.Unlike other dry, boring, theoretical writing on XML, this book doesn't cover the entire spectrum of XML technologies; it covers practical uses of XML that are useful to Web developers right now.This book is designed to help you to get your feet (and perhaps your ankles, shins, and knees) wet with the topic of XML. You can instantly test out and apply the code examples provided in the book (and available for free download) to get a hands-on feel for the technology, and you'll gain the confidence to go out and build more.The XML-powered content management system (CMS) that you'll build will be a complete, ready-to-use application. It draws on the author's experience of building XML-poweredWho Should Read This Book?No-Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP is ideal for Web developers who want to discover what can be done using XML, whether they be experienced with PHP or relative newcomers. All that's needed to get started is a good understanding of HTML and some experience with PHP.The book is written in the usual SitePoint style: it's clear and fun to read, with plenty of blocks of example code that you can apply immediately to your own Websites.There's no need to re-type any of the code from the book. As always, all customers will receive instant download access to all the code and files used in the book so you can apply them immediately to your own projects.What Slashdot.org Says...""Kudos to the author for writing chapters on XML without sounding boring, redundant or too academic. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in developing PHP-driven Web sites that provide or consume Web services, work with XML data or generate XML for others to use.""

Most web design books concentrate on a single technology or piece of software, leaving the designer to figure out how to put all the pieces together. This book is different. Web Designer's Reference provides a truly integrated approach to web design. Each of the dozen chapters covers a specific aspect of creating a web page, such as working with typography, adding images, creating navigation, and crafting CSS layouts. In each case, relevant XHTML elements are explored along with associated CSS, and visual design ideas are discussed. Several practical examples are provided, which you can use to further your understanding of each subject. This highly modular and integrated approach means that you learn about technologies in context, at the appropriate time and, upon working through each chapter, you craft a number of web page elements that you can use on countless sites in the future.This book is ideal for those making their first moves into standards-based web design, experienced designers who want to learn about modern design techniques and move toward creating CSS layouts, graphic designers who want to discover how to lay out their designs, and veteran web designers who want a concise reference guide.The book's advocacy of web standards, usability, and accessibility with a strong eye toward visual design means it is of use to technologists and designers alike, enabling everyone to build better websites. And for those moments when a particular tag or property value slips your mind, the book provides a comprehensive reference guide that includes important and relevant XHTML elements and attributes, XHTML entities, web colors, and CSS 2.1 properties and values.

SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2005 is the latest version of the reporting technology from Microsoft. This book examines all of the technology that SSRS provides to design, author, render and deploy professional business reports to the Web or to the company intranet (in a variety of formats, from HTML to XML, PDF, or TIFF), with detailed examples at every step.It covers all of the new functionality present in the 2005 version, including the new management and business intelligence development studios, as well as the new report viewer controls and end-user reporting tools. It also contains significantly expanded chapters on business intelligence, along with a wealth of tips and workarounds for effective development with SSRS.The authors are both highly experienced with SQL Server and with business reporting in the medical industry, which is subject to rigorous HIPAA regulations and strict security. It is not their intention to evangelize the product or present ""idealized"" examples based on the simple built-in schemas. Instead, they take a hard, critical look at the technology and provide exactly what the reader needs to know to deliver effective reports. Their code examples are based on real, complex schemas and the need to deliver versatile, dynamic reports, as well as on strict security and performance requirements.In summary, this book will provide you with step-by-step guides, best practices, and real code examples covering all of the common Reporting Services tasks, including:  A detailed overview of the reporting architecture and tools  The new Report Definition Language Standard, which is XML-based and allows you to define reports in VS.NET  Building effective queries for high-performance reporting  Building custom .NET applications with SSRS  Rendering reports to HTML, XML, PDF and Excel  Deploying secure reports, using Windows authentication through Active directory  Business Intelligence reporting using SQL Server Analysis Services

No sooner had I finished my first book on SharePoint technologies titled Microsoft Share- Point: Building Office 2003 Solutions than Gary Cornell sent me an e-mail asking for a sequel. I thought about the concept for a while and began to realize that there was a definite need in the SharePoint community for a book that went beyond the basics of team sites and web part construction. Based on feedback from customers, postings on the Web, e-mail inquiries, and blogs, I realized that people were struggling to create real solutions with SharePoint techno- gies. Everyone understands the basics, but many are having difficulty overcoming certain l- itations, customizing sites, and integrating with other Microsoft technologies. As SharePoint gains hold, I am increasingly seeing development teams stretching the product to behave in new ways. Much of this effort involves changing the underlying XML structure of SharePoint or manipulating the content database directly. This is an area where some guidance is required because you can easily destroy a SharePoint installation by man- ulating either of these subsystems. Many teams are also drastically changing the navigation system that SharePoint uses. P- ular alternatives involve the use of tabs or treeview controls to present views of sites and inf- mation. Additionally, developers often want to significantly customize search capabilities and present the results in unique ways. These modifications can dramatically impact performance if not done correctly. Finally, developers are beginning to realize that SharePoint is more than just an intranet.

There are many reasons for serving up dynamic content from a web site: to offer an online shopping site, create customized information pages for users, or just manage a large volume of content through a database. Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the background and tools to do the job safely and reliably. Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL, Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world applications. It goes into detail on such practical issues as validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks like?), logging in users, and using templates to give your dynamic web pages a standard look. But this book goes even further. It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools. Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking. Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software that are still in widespread use. This new edition has been redesigned around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics include: Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix(R), Windows(R), and Mac OS(R) X systems Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency User input validation, security, and authentication The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes Production of PDF reports

On the World Wide Web, speed and efficiency are vital. Users have little patience for slow web pages, while network administrators want to make the most of their available bandwidth. A properly designed web cache reduces network traffic and improves access times to popular web sites--a boon to network administrators and web users alike.Web Caching hands you all the technical information you need to design, deploy, and operate an effective web caching service. It starts with the basics of how web caching works, from the HTTP headers that govern cachability to cache validation and replacement algorithms.Topics covered in this book include: Designing an effective cache solutionConfiguring web browsers to use a cacheSetting up a collection of caches that can talk to each otherConfiguring an interception cache or proxyMonitoring and fine-tuning the performance of a cacheConfiguring web servers to cooperate with web cachesBenchmarking cache productsThe book also covers the important political aspects of web caching, including privacy, intellectual property, and security issues.Internet service providers, large corporations, or educational institutions--in short, any network that provides connectivity to a wide variety of users--can reap enormous benefit from running a well-tuned web caching service. Web Caching shows you how to do it right.

As long as there's been a Web, people have been trying to make it faster. The maturation of the Web has meant more users, more data, more features, and consequently longer waits on the Web. Improved performance has become a critical factor in determining the usability of the Web in general and of individual sites in particular.Web Performance Tuning, 2nd Edition is about getting the best possible performance from the Web. This book isn't just about tuning web server software; it's also about streamlining web content, getting optimal performance from a browser, tuning both client and server hardware, and maximizing the capacity of the network itself.Web Performance Tuning hits the ground running, giving concrete advice for quick results -- the ""blunt instruments"" for improving crippled performance right away. The book then shifts gears to give a conceptual background of the principles of computing performance. The latter half of the book examines each element of a web transaction -- from client to network to server -- to find the weak links in the chain and show how to strengthen them.In this second edition, the book has been significantly expanded to include: New chapters on Web site architecture, security, reliability, and their impact on performanceDetailed discussion of scalability of Java on multi-processor serversPerl scripts for writing web performance spiders that handle logins, cookies, SSL, and moreDetailed instructions on how to use Perl DBI and the open source program gnuplot to generate performance graphs on the flyCoverage of rstat, a Unix-based open source utility for gathering performance statistics remotelyIn addition, the book includes many more examples and graphs of real-world performance problems and their solutions, and has been updated for Java 2.This book is for anyone who has waited too long for a web page to display, or watched the servers they manage slow to a crawl. It's about making the Web more usable for everyone.

But don't just take our word for it. Read what others are saying about The Unusually Useful Web Book  ""This book definitely stands out. Most books of this nature are stuffed with irrelevant and non-substantive information that only add confusion to an already complex process. This book delivers an overwhelming amount of information but presents it in a way that is both approachable and useful. There was a lot of information that I could immediately apply to current projects."" Garo Green, Director of Publications, lynda.com  ""The coverage is practical and comprehensive. I'm not aware of other titles that take this comprehensive approach to web building, addressing the entire life cycle of web design and development as well as the roles required in each phase."" Laura McCabe, co-author of Special Edition Using Flash MX  ""Anyone that has a passion for web design, both novices and professionals, will enjoy this book. For the novice, it's an eye opener and the reader will probably be compelled to soak in all the material, cover to cover. For the professional, it's a strong reinforcement of things we often overlook and a great reference tool. I'm a professional and found it to be an up-to-date and refreshing read, and I plan on using it as a required textbook in the classroom for my students! They will truly benefit from this book and refer to it over and over again!"" Rosanna Yeung, Multimedia & Web Design Instructor, The Art Institute of California

Since the first edition of this classic reference was published, World Wide Web use has exploded and e-commerce has become a daily part of business and personal life. As Web use has grown, so have the threats to our security and privacy--from credit card fraud to routine invasions of privacy by marketers to web site defacements to attacks that shut down popular web sites.  Web Security, Privacy & Commerce goes behind the headlines, examines the major security risks facing us today, and explains how we can minimize them. It describes risks for Windows and Unix, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, and a wide range of current programs and products. In vast detail, the book covers: Web technology--The technological underpinnings of the modern Internet and the cryptographic foundations of e-commerce are discussed, along with SSL (the Secure Sockets Layer), the significance of the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), and digital identification, including passwords, digital signatures, and biometrics. Web privacy and security for users--Learn the real risks to user privacy, including cookies, log files, identity theft, spam, web logs, and web bugs, and the most common risk, users' own willingness to provide e-commerce sites with personal information. Hostile mobile code in plug-ins, ActiveX controls, Java applets, and JavaScript, Flash, and Shockwave programs are also covered. Web server security--Administrators and service providers discover how to secure their systems and web services. Topics include CGI, PHP, SSL certificates, law enforcement issues, and more. Web content security--Zero in on web publishing issues for content providers, including intellectual property, copyright and trademark issues, P3P and privacy policies, digital payments, client-side digital signatures, code signing, pornography filtering and PICS, and other controls on web content. Nearly double the size of the first edition, this completely updated volume is destined to be the definitive reference on Web security risks and the techniques and technologies you can use to protect your privacy, your organization, your system, and your network.

This book presents style guidelines based on quantitative research and practitioner lore about what works on the web, what flops, and what looks like leftover newsprint. It shows how to apply those guidelines to many common Internet genres such as customer assistance, product descriptions, distance learning, marketing emails, or webzines. The book also includes case studies of the prose from popular sites-two page spreads that will show a screenshot, and analysis of the prose to see how well it works. As more companies recognize that their survival depends on putting the whole company up on the web, everyone will have to write material that appears on the website-not just specialists in IT, or Marketing, or some out-sourced agency. This is the handbook for those people.

    此書的目的是幫助讀者開發Domino 網頁應用程式。在書中，不會看到LotusScript的歷史（因為誰會在乎？）、來自Proust的例子或諸如 “ 為了建立視界，從功能表選「建立」的「視界」選項 ” 毫無價值的句子。相反的，作者會用一連串的範例來幫助讀者，因為以不變應萬變是最好的方法。
    簡言之，作者的目標是希望在Domino領域，讀者能和他並駕齊驅，並能創造出更好的Domino工作環境。

資料庫實務
　近年來，隨著 Internet 的快速成長，我想有大半的功勞得歸功於 Microsoft 所發展的 Windows 作業系統，也可以說，若沒有 Windows 作業系統的問世，那今日的資訊是否能如此普及還是一個疑問，即使在眾人抱怨聲不斷及責難下成長的 Windows 作業系統，穩定性極為不佳，但在市場上的佔有率仍是第一。所以 PHP 能夠在市場上竄紅，要感謝 Linux、 FreeBSD 等作業系統。但是資訊能夠擁有今日的普及，卻得歸功於 Windows。

　Internet 近年來的成長是如此快速，要如何用簡單又快速的方式，輕鬆架構一套屬於您個人風格的 Web 網站資料庫？歡迎您打開”PHP 與 My SQL 架構 Web 資料庫實務”一書，一窺其中的奧妙！

The vitality and accessibility of Fritjof Capra's ideas have made him perhaps the most eloquent spokesperson of the latest findings emerging at the frontiers of scientific, social, and philosophical thought. In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point,  he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life,  Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the ""web of life."" During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life,  Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations. Now available in paperback for the first time, The Web of Life is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's Chaos,  Gregory Bateson's Mind and Matter,  and Ilya Prigogine's Order Out of Chaos.

網頁≠網路產品

HTML+CSS≠良好的使用流程

掌握這精髓，朝網路產品設計師的道路邁進吧！

	 

	網頁已經不再只是使用者與網路交流的唯一媒介，我們每天用的手機應用程式，例如Facebook、Twitter、Pinterest，也是網路交流的一部分。這些與網路有關的「產品」，就是「網路產品」。

	 

	網路產品要的不只是外觀漂亮、效果酷炫，讓使用者感覺不到背後的流程運作，還會想重複使用，這才算的上是成功的使用者體驗。因此，拋開過去只侷限在「網頁設計」、「UI設計」、「UX設計」的思考範圍吧，要製造出成功的網路產品，你必須像個產品設計師一樣思考。

	 

	Etsy是Alexa排名的全球前兩百大、美國前五十大網站，要能每個月成交上千萬筆訂單，必須要設計出讓這千萬名使用者都流暢的瀏覽過程。蘭迪．杭特以Etsy創意總監的自身經驗，介紹要以產品設計師的角度思考，該具備何種思維、技能、工具，並解釋使用者在網路瀏覽過程中的感受。

	 

	如果你還不確定成為一名網路產品設計師需要注意哪些細節，如果想知道如何讓使用者更常使用你的網路產品，這本書絕對是你迎接新思維的最佳入門解說。

接著第四章是一些步驟，讓您能夠安裝「所有的」Oracle軟體在一台機器上，也就是資料庫，應用程式伺服器以及發展環境。在理想的情況下，您將會需要一部性能中上的個人電腦來安裝這些軟體。電腦上應該要有Windows NT或Windows 2000作業系統，至少256MB的記憶體（128MB也成，但是要大一點的硬碟置換空間）。整個安裝過程的指令是假設安裝在Windows 2000之上，但是絕大多數的指令在Linux和其他Unix環境下也都一樣。 
第五章則介紹一些應用程式發展的方法論，無論您選擇用Java、PL/SQL或其他語言都可以派上用場。 
第六章描述用Java servlet和Oracle JDeveloper發展四個小型網頁程式；第七章則改用PL/SQL語言完成這些工作。為了讓您在各個章節中相互對照，這兩章採用同樣的資料，這也說明了儘管程式語言不同，寫程式的方法都是大同小異。 
第八章和第九章講的是如何用Oracle程式碼產生工具，也就是Oracle Designer和Oracle Portal。在這兩章裏，同樣的四個小應用程式也拿來當作例子。 
第十章則提到Oracle主從式架構發展工具Forms和Reports，它們同樣可以來發展網頁應用程式。 
第十一章列出一些當您在發展Oracle網頁應用程式時會用到的一些工具和小幫手。
第十二章則解釋範例程式中用到的核心程式庫（本書所有範例程式都可以從www.vesterli.com下載）。最後一章提供您一些書籍和網站的建議清單，讓您可以繼續深入研究到達Oracle網頁應用程式大師的境界。
