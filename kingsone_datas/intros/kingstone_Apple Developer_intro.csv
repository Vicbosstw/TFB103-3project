Welcome to the Apple Software Protection Digest - dedicated to the subject of protection and how it relates to software for the Apple II series of computers. You will learn how to protect, unprotect and backup your software. Inside this collection are Jules H. Gilder's six issues published between 1985 and 1986. Too often, purchasers of programs get stuck. They buy a program only to discover that it can't be used with a particular accessory board or disk drive. And, because the program is protected, it can't be modified. Apple II owners need a place where they can get more information about software protection. They need to know what software protection is, how it's implemented, what are the consequences of it, how it can be overcome if necessary and if there are any comparable unprotected alternatives to particular protected software packages. Apple Software Protection Digest will provide you with this information and more. It will show you new ways to protect, unprotect and backup your programs. It will teach you how to prevent others from accessing your programs and it will show you how to make them more difficult to copy. In addition, you'll learn how to overcome these and other protection schemes that are in use. You'll learn how to use the powerful, but complicated nibble copy programs. You'll also learn how to crack or remove protection entirely from many programs. With the programs that are included in each issue of the Digest, you'll build a valuable library of utility software that will make the job of protecting, unprotecting and backing up software easier. And, tutorials will keep you up-to-date on both simple and sophisticated protection techniques. In addition to all this, you will get reviews of hardware, software and books that are of particular importance to the software protection field. Programmers work long, hard hours to get their software working and they deserve to be compensated fairly for it. On the other hand, the honest consumer should not be penalized and limited in their application of a particular program simply because the publisher decided to protect it. You may have a legitimate need to backup a program and we hope to supply you with the knowledge you need to do that. Alternatively, you may wish to protect a program that you've written so that others can't copy it. We'll show you how to do that too.

Apple scab, caused by the fungal pathogen Venturia inaequalis (Cke.) Wint. (anamorph Spilocaea pomi Fr.), is a major disease affecting apples grown in temperate climates around the world including Pakistan. This disease can have a significant economic impact as diseased fruit are not marketable. The uncontrolled disease results in the reduction of fruit quality and quantity or almost complete devastation of apple crop. Severe attacks of scab had a negative effect on tree viability the following year, due to lower leaf photosynthetic activity, fewer fruit buds and leaves being formed, more leaves being dropped and that scab also had a debilitating effect on normal wood growth needed for high yields. Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the key contributor of apple production in Pakistan. Orchard management techniques, such as leaf litter control, can reduce primary inoculum but usually are not sufficient to control apple scab, and as many as 18-25 fungicide applications per season may be required. Information regarding pathogen epidemiology and control available to apple growers for the sustainable control of scab is largely unknown and needs to be addressed.

This recently released product uses the watchOS 7.0 which is the more improved version of the operating system for the Apple watch series. The watch OS 7.0 is very compatible with Apple iPhones using iOS 14.0.Aside from this, the Apple watch series 6 has been redesigned for better performance. The processor is an A13 bionic (S6) which makes the watch about 20% better in its speed and performance. The Apple watch series 6 can ultimately be connected to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ultra wideband. It also comes with a storage capacity of about 32 GB while its RAM is 1 GB.As amazing as all the new features are, it's not quite as easy to use with an iPhone; the lack of buttons, the smaller screen, and general UI can create a frustrating initial experience. The point of this book is to help new Apple Watch users (and users updating to watchOS 7 from an older device) and seniors get the most out of their investment....

Covering these skills alongside the fundamentals and foundations of modern web development, rather than specifics of current technologies and frameworks (which can age quickly), all programming examples are given in the context of the web as it is in 2018. Although you need to feel comfortable working on code at the system, database, API, middleware or user interface level, depending on the task in hand, you also need to be able to deal with the big picture and the little details. The Full Stack Developer recognizes skills beyond the technical, and gives foundational knowledge of the wide set of skills needed in a modern software development team.  What You'll LearnPlan your work including Agile vs Waterfall, tools, scrum, kanban and continuous deliveryTranslate UX into code: grids, component libraries and style guidesDesign systems and system architectures (microservices to monoliths)Review patterns for APIs (SOAP, AJAX, REST), defining API domains, patterns for REST APIs and more API goodnessStudy the various front-end design patterns you need to knowStore data, what to consider for security, deployment, in production and more  Who This Book Is For New graduates or junior developers who are transitioning to working as part of a larger team structure in a multi-disciplinary teams and developers previously focused on only front-end or back-end dev transitioning into full stack.

Working effectively with Apple platforms at a corporate or business level includes not only infrastructure, but a mode of thinking that administrators have to adopt to find success. A mode of thinking that forces you to leave 30 years of IT dogma at the door. This book is a guide through how to integrate Apple products in your environment with a minimum of friction. Because the Apple ecosystem is not going away.You'll start by understanding where Apple, third-party software vendors, and the IT community is taking us. What is Mobile Device Management and how does it work under the hood. By understanding how MDM works, you will understand what needs to happen on your networks in order to allow for MDM, as well as the best way to give the least amount of access to the servers or services that's necessary. You'll then look at management agents that do not include MDM, as well as when you will need to use an agent as opposed to when to use other options. Once you can install a management solution, you can deploy profiles on a device or you can deploy profiles on Macs using scripts. With Apple Device Management as your guide, you'll customize and package software for deployment and lock down devices so they're completely secure. You'll also work on getting standard QA environments built out, so you can test more effectively with less effort. Apple is forging their own path in IT. They trade spots with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as the wealthiest company to ever exist. And they will not be constrained by 30 or more years of dogma in the IT industry. You can try to shoehorn Apple devices into outdated modes of device management, or you can embrace Apple's stance on management with the help of this book. What You'll LearnDeploy profiles across devices effectively and securelyInstall apps remotely both from the app store and through custom solutionsWork natively with Apple environments rather than retrofitting older IT solutions Who This Book Is ForMac administrators within organizations that want to integrate with the current Apple ecosystem, including Windows administrators learning how to use/manage Macs, mobile administrators working with iPhones and iPads, and mobile developers tasked with creating custom apps for internal, corporate distribution.

The Nobel laureate Otto Warburg--a cousin of the famous finance Warburgs--was widely regarded in his day as one of the most important biochemists of the twentieth century, a man whose research was integral to humanity's understanding of cancer. He was also among the most despised figures in Nazi Germany. As a Jewish homosexual living openly with his male partner, Warburg represented all that the Third Reich abhorred. Yet Hitler and his top advisors dreaded cancer, and protected Warburg in the hope that he could cure it.In Ravenous, Sam Apple reclaims Otto Warburg as a forgotten, morally compromised genius who pursued cancer single-mindedly even as Europe disintegrated around him. While the vast majority of Jewish scientists fled Germany in the anxious years leading up to World War II, Warburg remained in Berlin, working under the watchful eye of the dictatorship. With the Nazis goose-stepping their way across Europe, systematically rounding up and murdering millions of Jews, Warburg awoke each morning in an elegant, antiques-filled home and rode horses with his partner, Jacob Heiss, before delving into his research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society.Hitler and other Nazi leaders, Apple shows, were deeply troubled by skyrocketing cancer rates across the Western world, viewing cancer as an existential threat akin to Judaism or homosexuality. Ironically, they viewed Warburg as Germany's best chance of survival. Setting Warburg's work against an absorbing history of cancer science, Apple follows him as he arrives at his central belief that cancer is a problem of metabolism. Though Warburg's metabolic approach to cancer was considered groundbreaking, his work was soon eclipsed in the early postwar era, after the discovery of the structure of DNA set off a search for the genetic origins of cancer.Remarkably, Warburg's theory has undergone a resurgence in our own time, as scientists have begun to investigate the dangers of sugar and the link between obesity and cancer, finding that the way we eat can influence how cancer cells take up nutrients and grow. Rooting his revelations in extensive archival research as well as dozens of interviews with today's leading cancer authorities, Apple demonstrates how Warburg's midcentury work may well hold the secret to why cancer became so common in the modern world and how we can reverse the trend. A tale of scientific discovery, personal peril, and the race to end a disastrous disease, Ravenous would be the stuff of the most inventive fiction were it not, in fact, true.

More recent myths about particle physics and Einstein's theory of relativity are discredited too, and a number of dubious generalizations, like the notion that science and religion are antithetical, or that science can neatly be distinguished from pseudoscience, go under the microscope of history.Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science brushes away popular fictions and refutes the widespread belief that science advances when individual geniuses experience ""Eureka!"" moments and suddenly grasp what those around them could never imagine.""Delightful...thought-provoking...Every reader should find something to surprise them.""--Jim Endersby, Science""Better than just countering the myths, the book explains when they arose and why they stuck.""--The Guardian

Alles an diesem Ger瓣t wurde so konzipiert, dass es dich zu mehr Bewegung motiviert. Die Serie 5 ist noch einen Schritt weiter gegangen und hat eine der am h瓣ufigsten nachgefragten Funk-tionen hinzugef羹gt: ein st瓣ndig eingeschaltetes Dis-play. Etwas, das, wie zu bemerken ist, funktioniert, ohne dass die Batterie darunter leidet.So erstaunlich all die neuen Funktionen auch sind, ist sie nicht ganz so einfach zu bedienen wie ein iPhone; das Fehlen von Tasten, der kleinere Bild-schirm und die allgemeine Benutzeroberfl瓣che k繹n-nen zu einer frustrierenden ersten Erfahrung f羹hren.

In a word: services. In the past few years (especially in 2019) Apple announced several services--things people would opt into to pay for monthly. It was a way to continue making money even when people were not buying hardware.For it to work, Apple knew it had to be good.

Development of a successful technique for apple micropropagation is very important to produce healthy, disease free plants and in the rapid multiplication of scions and rootstocks with desirable traits. This progress is dependent on several factors such as applied technique, plant material preparation and medium composition, especially, plant growth regulators. Successful micropropagation of apple using pre-existing meristems (culture of apical buds or nodal segments) is influenced by several internal (physiological state, genotype), and external (medium composition, technique, in vitro conditions) factors. Different stages of apple micropropagation such as shoot multiplication, rooting of microshoots and acclimatization were strongly dependent upon medium composition. In this book, mainly impact of medium composition (plant growth regulators, mineral nutrients, organic and gelling agents) on growth asects such as: multiplication rate, shoot elongation, bud formation, leaf development, callusing and rooting of different apple genotypes cultured on gelled basal Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium are discussed in details.

Time and Consistent Relativity: Physical and Mathematical Fundamentals establishes a new and original theory of time relativity, which is fully consistent. It explains why Einstein's theory of time relativity is physically meaningless and mathematically based on tacit inacceptable assumptions, and why it represents the singular case from the mathematical point of view. The consistent relativity theory established in the book represents an exit from the situation created by Einstein's theory of time relativity.This original book presents novel results on time and its relativity that constitute the consistent relativity theory. The results are free of mistakes, inconsistencies, and paradoxes of Einstein's time relativity theory. The author's original discoveries and results constitute the new physical and mathematical fundamentals on time and its relativity. The book presentation is concise, clear, and self-contained. It covers the phenomenon of time and its properties and results in a definition and characterization of time. It enables the great variety of new mathematical results presented in the form of theorems and their corollaries and specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for the corresponding statements to hold. The proofs are rigorous.This book:   Explains the physical nature of time   Presents the definition and characterization of time   Explains the physical sense of time relativity   Rejects Einstein's time relativity theory as the general one   Proves that Einstein's time relativity theory represents a singular case valid under tacit, physically meaningless and mathematically inacceptable, assumptions   Generalizes and extends the Galilean-Newtonian meaning of time and its relativity   Introduces various new classes of mathematical transformations related to temporal, spatial, and velocity coordinates and proves the necessary and sufficient conditions for their validity   Discovers a great specter of new results on the time uniqueness, relativity, and temporal speed   Discovers and proves a great specter of new results on the velocity and its transformations   Discovers and proves a great specter of new results on the light speed and its invariance and non-invariance   Discovers and proves the relationship of the light speed and the upper limiting speed   Opens new directions for further research in physics and mathematical physics

Eclipse is a new open-source, Java-based, extensible development platform designed for nothing in particular but everything in general. Because of its roots, it is currently most popular as a Java integrated development environment (IDE). Eclipse ships with plugins for writing and debugging Java code. Additional plugins for more advanced Java development, such as JSP/servlets, are available from third parties. This book provides a thorough guide to using Eclipse features and plugins effectively in the context of real-world Java development. Realistic examples demonstrate how to use Eclipse effectively to build, test and debug applications using the tools provided by Eclipse and other third-party open source plugins. The reader will learn how to use plugin tools for using Eclipse in a team environment, including using Ant for more sophisticated build processes and CVS for source control. Plugin-ins for building web applications, using J2EE technologies, such as JSP/Servlets and EJB, are also discussed. Complementing this coverage of Eclipse in the context of development is a reference providing a comprehensive guide to Eclipse. Because Eclipse and its plugins provide a remarkable array of features, it is often hard to learn what features are available and how they can be invoked. This reference lays things out clearly: feature-by-feature, menu-by-menu.

What do Ford Financial, IBM, and Victoria's Secret have in common? Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB). As the industry standard for platform-independent reusable business components, EJB has just become Sun Microsystem's latest developer certification. Whether you want to be certifiable or just want to learn the technology inside and out, Head First EJB will get you there in the least painful way. And with the greatest understanding.You'll learn not just what the technology is, but more importantly, why it is, and what it is and isn't good for. You'll learn tricks and tips for EJB development, along with tricks and tips for passing this latest, very challenging Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. You'll learn how to think like a server. You'll learn how to think like a bean. And because this is a Head First book, you'll learn how to think about thinking.Co-author Kathy Sierra was one of Sun's first employees to teach brave, early adopter customers how to use EJB. She has the scars. But besides dragging you deep into EJB technology, Kathy and Bert will see you through your certification exam, if you decide to go for it. And nobody knows the certification like they do - they're co-developers of Sun's actual exam!As the second book in the Head First series, Head First EJB follows up the number one best-selling Java book in the US, Head First Java. Find out why reviewers are calling it a revolution in learning tough technical topics, and why Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy says, ""Java technology is everywhere...if you develop software and haven't learned Java, it's definitely time to dive in ""Head First.""And with Head First book, you don't even have to feel guilty about having fun while you're learning; it's all part of the learning theory. If the latest research in cognitive science, education, and neurobiology suggested that boring, dry, and excruciatingly painful was the best way to learn, we'd have done it. Thankfully, it's been shown that your brain has a sense of style, a sense of humour, and a darn good sense of what it likes and dislikes.In Head First EJB, you'll learn all about: Component-based and role-based development The architecture of EJB, distributed programming with RMIDeveloping and Deploying an EJB applicationThe Client View of a Session and Entity beanThe Session Bean Lifecycle and Component ContractThe Entity bean Lifecycle and Component ContractContainer-managed Persistence (CMP)Container-managed Relationships (CMR)EJB-QLTransactionsSecurityEJB ExceptionsThe Deployment DescriptorThe Enterprise Bean Environment in JNDIProgramming Restrictions and PortabilityThe book includes over 200 mock exam questions that match the tone, style, difficulty, and topics on the real SCBCD exam. See why Kathy and Bert are responsible for thousands of successful exam-passers--""The Sun certification exam was certainly no walk in the park, but Kathy's material allowed me to not only pass the exam, but Ace it!""--Mary Whetsel, Sr. Technology Specialist, Application Strategy and Integration, The St. Paul Companies""Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates are two of the few people in the world who can make complicated things seem damn simple, and as if that isn't enough, they can make boring things seem interesting.""--Paul Wheaton, The Trail Boss, javaranch.com""Who better to write a Java study guide than Kathy Sierra, reigning queen of Java instruction?

本書完整介紹如何使用Developer - Developer Server 6.0發展Internet應用程式。書中提供專家建議、詳細解說及完全解答，帶領您透過Developer創造堅固且精確的Internet應用程式。

建議大家閱讀IEEE Software雜誌最近刊登David Garlan、Robert Allen及John Ockerbollm發表的Architectural Mismatch：Why Reuse Is so Hard (IEEE Software，第12冊編號6，1995年11月，第17至26頁)。本篇文章影響我對「再使用」軟體的觀念。「再使用」是軟體工程的聖杯，但是軟體界卻從沒有武士能尋獲此聖杯。文章中探討了原因何在，最主要的原因是設計者無法找到適合的可再使用的軟體。
追尋軟體「再使用」聖杯的觀念看起來似乎合理，但是我也相信軟體界大多數的人都不是高貴的武士，永遠尋找完美。我們大部份只想著把工作完成，盡力給顧客有價值的成品。軟體再使用的原則的確有道理，但以現實的角度來看卻不盡然。
特定的工具有特定的用途。舉例而言，你到規模大的五金行，你會發現許多不同款式的鋸子，不同的木頭要使用不同的鋸子，不同的切割方向也要使用不同的鋸子，不同的切割地點也要使用不同的鋸子(如鋸斷牆壁上的木頭需要特別的鋸子，因為你不可能把牆壁搬到桌上再用一般的鋸子切割)。你也要依據電源供應來選擇鋸子，也可能只是為了節省一些錢(如比較各家廠牌、國際廠牌或是偏好國貨)而選用不同的鋸子。再者，世界每天改變，新的建材、新的地點及新的賣商每天都增加，創造了更多的需求。您要有對工具、建材、場合及較大的現金流通有多年的經驗，才能針對不同的工作選用適當的鋸子。 
能幹的建造師不會死板地依照工具設計時的預期功能來使用工具。根據經驗，他們會視不同的場合巧妙地運用工具。「使用」工具與「設計」工具不同，使用工具需要一些知識及創意。但是巧妙地運用工具仍有基本的限制，任何運用都不可能超出設計的限制。 
如同鋸子一樣，Developer也是一種工具。經過12年多的發展，Developer已成為高效能、範圍廣的應用工具。就如同任何工具一般，Developer也有它的限制及缺點，它有預期的功能，但是使用者可以勇敢地設法突破這些預期的功能，以達到巧妙的運用。

在天文觀測中，有不少“引力異常現象”，是既有的引力理論所無法解釋的。因此，研究各種空間粒子的運動對形成力的影響，具有舉足輕重的意義。本人從客觀實際出發，根據恒星的粒子輻射，推導出了恒星的三個斥力公式，並且撰寫了恒星斥力的文章。力的存在一定會有施力者。我反復揣摩：靠品質本身就能形成引力，這從能量守恆定律的角度看，是說不通的。進一步的推論是，引力的施力者應該存在於品質之外。經過長期思考，我認為，相鄰的兩個物體之間，能出現“引力”，根據引力表現出的各種特徵，比較像是宇宙空間環境中漫射的神秘莫測的強透射粒子搗鬼的結果。目前，我們雖然全面探測它們有困難，但也不能輕率地否認它們的存在和作用。中微子是強透射粒子的典型代表，尤其是 。 是隱形高手，身懷絕技，最有可能是引力的肇事者。宇宙中中微子的通量，目前我們無法確知。在沒有找到更有說服力的引力理論之前，要認可宇宙大爆炸理論是完全正確的，也為時尚早。2013年3月，我對強透射粒子作用於兩物體之間，建立分析模型，從構造方面重新推導了引力公式，當得到 這一形式後，並沒有見到 ，而是在 的寶座上尊坐著七個因數。這一新的引力公式，對引力理論中長期保留的某些懸案，給出了有價值的回答。由於恒星存在斥力，致使恒星與其週邊天體之間的“引力與斥力之和”，與行星與其週邊天體之間的“引力與斥力之和”，其構成要素是不一樣的。也就是說，地球對於地球上每個“蘋果”的合力，與太陽對於太陽的每個“蘋果”（八大行星以及小行星們）的合力，其力的構成要素（包括萬有引力、輻射斥力、旋轉離心力和地面支撐力）是不一樣的。這也是本書書名《太陽的蘋果》的由來。本書的內容，從一個側面證明了，我們過去公認的牛頓引力公式中的“常數 值”項，應該不是一個常數。這一核心內涵，作者通過本書提出來。特結此書，呈獻給廣大的科學工作者，以方便共同探討神秘莫測的引力問題。

""This book is written from a powerfully felt, personal perspective: that software construction is primarily a problem-solving activity; that all problem-solving requires creativity; that software problem-solving is deeply complex, perhaps more deeply complex than any other activity; and that, therefore, software problem-solving requires the ultimate in creativity."" --Robert L. Glass, from the Preface In Software Creativity 2.0, acclaimed author Robert L. Glass explores a critical, yet strangely neglected, question: What is the role of creativity in software engineering and computer programming? With his trademark easy-to-read style and practical approach, backed by research and personal experience, Glass takes on a wide range of related angles and implications. To name only a few: * Are discipline and formality at odds with flexibility and agility? * When are control-driven vs. experimentation-driven approaches most effective? * Can we ""make creativity happen"" in a software organization? * Which is more important, process or product? * How do theory and practice interact in the software field? Can practitioners and academe complement each other more effectively? * Is there a missing link between creativity and software design? * What is the balance of ""intellectual"" and ""clerical"" tasks in software work? * Can we still find a place for plain old fun? Revised, updated, and expanded, Software Creativity 2.0 also features a new Foreword by Tom DeMarco, author of Peopleware, and a new Preface by author Robert L. Glass.

Software Conflict 2.0: The Art and Science of Software Engineering updates and expands a neglected classic in the field. The nearly 60 essays in this book--always easily digestible, often profound, and never too serious--are the work of pioneer Robert L. Glass, 50 year software veteran, and author or editor of more than 25 books, including the recent bestseller Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering. As loyal Glass readers have come to expect, Software Conflict 2.0 takes up large themes and important questions, never shying away from controversy. Robert Glass has a unique perspective, owing partly to his longevity in the field, partly to his breadth and depth of experience as a practitioner, and partly to his experiences on multiple continents crossing back and forth between the worlds of the university and the professional programming shop. No matter what unique corner of the software engineering world you call home--be it aerospace or e-commerce--whether you are a researcher, hardcore coder, consultant, or manager, Software Conflict 2.0 tackles questions and conflicts that you will recognize. Bob Glass's wide and deep perspective on the art and science of software engineering will widen and deepen your own perspective. Pragmatic Programmer Andy Hunt writes in his Foreword to this book, ""Eleventh-century philosopher Pierre Abelard taught that, 'The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question, and by seeking we may come upon the truth.' Welcome to Bob's essays on software conflict. Here you'll find the seeds of doubt, some underlying questions, and a fellow seeker."" We couldn't agree more. The first edition of Software Conflict was published circa 1990 and, until now, has been out of print for some time. Why? Mainly because that聶s the normal pattern for software books: a new book is hot when it hits the streets, but then trends change, paradigms shift, and eventually the publisher stops placing orders with the printer. As hundreds of new books are published every year, a real treasure can be buried in the shifting sands. Sometimes the significance of a software book transcends the endless cycle of trends and revolutions. In fact, some of the great software books continue to be discussed even decades after their original publication. Why do people keep reading these ""dated"" software engineering books? Because the insights of these great books are timeless, as valid today as they were yesterday. Because these insights help us become better software professionals, better researchers, better managers. And because the writings of a computing pioneer like Robert L. Glass might just reveal something about where we are today and where we聶re headed. Software Conflict 2.0 features six new essays by Robert Glass and a new Foreword by Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Programmers.

Learning Carbon is designed to get you programming right away in Carbon(TM), one of two APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces) Macintosh(R) programmers can use to write applications that run native in Mac(R) OS X. Using Carbon, you don't have to rewrite your Mac OS programs entirely to get them to take advantage of the new features in Mac OS X. Instead, all you have to rewrite is the 10 to 20 percent of the code that can't be translated to OS X. For C programmers, Apple's Carbon is the essential building block for applications on Mac OS X. With Carbon, you can use simple, traditional C interfaces to create world-class applications for a world-class operating system.After orienting you with a detailed tour of a Carbon application, Learning Carbon walks you through the entire process of designing and creating a complete Carbon application called Moon Travel Planner. Along the way, you'll be introduced to two pivotal development tools: Project Builder and Interface Builder. You'll learn key concepts about Carbon and Mac OS X programming, including event management, resource handling, and bundle anatomy. And you'll get direct, hands-on instruction on how to implement essential application tasks, such as managing windows, printing documents, opening and saving files, creating and responding to menu commands, providing user help, and organizing your application for easy localization in multiple countries and languages. After finishing this book, you'll be ready to start writing your own Carbon applications.Written by Apple insiders with access to engineers deeply involved in creating Mac OS X, Learning Carbon brings you information that's not available anywhere else, to get you in on the ground floor of the exciting new Mac OS X application development market.
