All computer systems can suffer from malware, ransomware, rootkit and viruses, including Linux and BSD OS. Thankfully, very few viruses exist for Linux, so users typically do not install antivirus software. It is still recommended that Linux users have antivirus software installed on Linux systems that are on a network or that have files being transferred to the device. Some users may argue that antivirus software uses up too much resources. Thankfully, low-footprint software exists for Linux. To better understand antivirus programs, it may be beneficial to understand malware itself. If you are running a SME business with a number of workstations, it might be a good idea to install an antivirus on the central computer that manages all the emails, data and traffic in your company. The best way to protect a system against viruses is to only download and install software from trusted sites and developers. With the discontinuation of AVG Antivirus for Linux and the lack of security suite from big players such as Symantec Norton or Intel McAfee, Linux are left with a few choices when it comes to OS security. Linux users are generally free from virus attack but bugs that enables a hacker to take over your linux system is out there, thus an antivirus with a good firewall is a must for your Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Bodhi, Elementary, Fedora, CentOS and more.

In the world of Unix operating systems, the various BSDs come with a long heritage of high-quality software and well-designed solutions, making them a favorite OS of a wide range of users. Among budget-minded users who adopted BSD early on to developers of some of today's largest Internet sites, the popularity of BSD systems continues to grow. If you use the BSD operating system, then you know that the secret of its success is not just in its price tag: practical, reliable, extraordinarily stable and flexible, BSD also offers plenty of fertile ground for creative, time-saving tweaks and tricks, and yes, even the chance to have some fun.""Fun?"" you ask. Perhaps ""fun"" wasn't covered in the manual that taught you to install BSD and administer it effectively. But BSD Hacks, the latest in O'Reilly's popular Hacks series, offers a unique set of practical tips, tricks, tools--and even fun--for administrators and power users of BSD systems.BSD Hacks takes a creative approach to saving time and getting more done, with fewer resources. You'll take advantage of the tools and concepts that make the world's top Unix users more productive.

You'll learn how to be more productive in the command line, timesaving tips for setting user-defaults, how to automate long commands, and save long sessions for later review.
