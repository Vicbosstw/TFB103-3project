The Raspberry Pi Pico is a remarkable microcontroller. It has a power and sophistication that would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. For the sort of jobs it is ideal for, it has plenty of processing power and enough memory to make tasks that would have once required careful planning, relatively easy. Instead of struggling with the machine, you can now focus on getting a good implementation of your algorithms. To enjoy all of its power and sophistication there is no better language than C. It wastes none of the power and it gives you what you need to get at the new features. However, getting started with the Pico with C is no easy feat, which is what motivated this book about creating programs so that testing and debugging is easy.Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico in C uses the highly popular VS Code as its development environment and shows how to use a Raspberry Pi or a desktop PC running Windows as your development machine. The purpose of the book is to reveal what you can do with the Pico's GPIO lines together with widely used sensors, servos and motors and ADCs. After covering the GPIO, outputs and inputs, events and interrupts, it gives you hands-on experience of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), the SPI bus, the I2C bus and the 1-Wire bus. One of the key advantages of the Pico is its PIO (Programmable I/O) and while this is an advanced feature it is included in this book. After finding out how the PIO works, we apply it to writing a PIO program for the DHT22 and the 1-Wire bus. One current drawback of the Pico it is that it doesn't have a network connection. To solve this problem there is a chapter on using the low-cost ESP8266 as a WiFi client and web server. The two devices together make the Pico a true IoT device. Harry Fairhead has a hardware background and, having worked with microprocessors and electronics in general, for many years, he is an enthusiastic proponent of the IoT and embedded computing. He is the author of two books intended for C programmers, Fundamental C: Getting Closer To The Machine and  Applying C For the IoT With Linux and four books on the using the Raspberry Pi in an IoT context, two using C and two using Python. He is now working on a Python version of this book for the Pico.

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. Although stage I osteosarcoma has a promising prognosis, stage III osteosarcoma with lung metastases with only about 30% survival rate is worrying. Expression of EGFR and its downstream proteins has been regularly observed in osteosarcoma. In this book, the main focus is on two major aims: 1.Analysis of the role of EGFR signaling during bone tumor formation by breeding H2-c-fosLTR transgenic mice, that develop OS with 100% penetrance, to mice that harbor either reduced (Egfrwa2/wa2) or elevated (Col1-AREG) EGFR signaling; 2.Analysis of the effect of EGFR inhibition on proliferation, viability and apoptosis as well as on EGFR downstream signaling proteins in c fos transgenic osteosarcoma cells.

 Fully updated and authoritative reference to wind energy technology written by leading academic and industry professionals The newly revised Third Edition of the Wind Energy Handbook delivers a fully updated treatment of key developments in wind technology since the publication of the book's Second Edition in 2011. The criticality of wakes within wind farms is addressed by the addition of an entirely new chapter on wake effects, including 'engineering' wake models and wake control. Offshore, attention is focused for the first time on the design of floating support structures, and the new 'PISA' method for monopile geotechnical design is introduced. The coverage of blade design has been completely rewritten, with an expanded description of laminate fatigue properties and new sections on manufacturing methods, blade testing, leading-edge erosion and bend-twist coupling. These are complemented by new sections on blade add-ons and noise in the aerodynamics chapters, which now also include a description of the Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model and an extended introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis. The importance of the environmental impact of wind farms both on- and offshore is recognized by expanded coverage, and the requirements of the Grid Codes to ensure wind energy plays its full role in the power system are described. The conceptual design chapter has been extended to include a number of novel concepts, including low induction rotors, multiple rotor structures, superconducting generators and magnetic gearboxes. References and further reading resources are included throughout the book and have been updated to cover the latest literature. As in previous editions, the core subjects constituting the essential background to wind turbine and wind farm design are covered. These include:   The nature of the wind resource, including geographical variation, synoptic and diurnal variations, and turbulence characteristics The aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbines, including the actuator disc concept, rotor disc theory, the vortex cylinder model of the actuator disc and the Blade-Element/Momentum theory Design loads for horizontal axis wind turbines, including the prescriptions of international standards Alternative machine architectures The design of key components Wind turbine controller design for fixed and variable speed machines The integration of wind farms into the electrical power system Wind farm design, siting constraints, and the assessment of environmental impact  Perfect for engineers and scientists learning about wind turbine technology, the Wind Energy Handbook will also earn a place in the libraries of graduate students taking courses on wind turbines and wind energy, as well as industry professionals whose work requires a deep understanding of wind energy technology.

The theory of holomorphic functions of several complex variables emerged from the attempt to generalize the theory in one variable to the multidimensional situation. Research in this area has led to the discovery of many sophisticated facts, structures, ideas, relations, and applications. This deepening of knowledge, however, has also revealed more and more paradoxical differences between the structures of the two theories. The authors of this Research Note were driven by the quest to construct a theory in several complex variables that has the same structure as the one-variable theory. That is, they sought a reproducing kernel for the whole class that is universal and from same class. Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in Cm documents their success. Their highly original approach allowed them to obtain new results and refine some well-known results from the classical theory of several complex variables. The 'hyperholomorphic theory they developed proved to be a kind of direct sum of function theories for two Dirac-type operators of Clifford analysis considered in the same domain. In addition to new results and methods, this work presents a first-look at a brand new setting, based upon the natural language of differential forms, for complex analysis. Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in Cm reveals a deep link between the fields of several complex variables theory and Clifford analysis. It will have a strong influence on researchers in both areas, and undoubtedly will change the general viewpoint on the methods and ideas of several complex variables theory.

En este libro urgente y necesario Bill Gates propone un plan amplio, pr獺ctico --y comprensible-- para conseguir que el mundo llegue a cero emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero para as穩 evitar una cat獺strofe clim獺tica. Bill Gates ha pasado una d矇cada investigando las causas y efectos del cambio clim獺tico. Con la ayuda de expertos en los campos de la f穩sica, la qu穩mica, la biolog穩a, la ingenier穩a, las ciencias pol穩ticas y las finanzas, se ha centrado en investigar exactamente qu矇 se debe hacer para detener la deriva del planeta hacia un desastre ambiental. En este libro, adem獺s de explicar por qu矇 debemos esforzarnos en lograr emisiones netas cero de gases de efecto invernadero, tambi矇n detalla lo que debemos hacer para lograr este objetivo tan importante. Gates nos presenta una descripci籀n clara de los desaf穩os que enfrentamos. A partir de su conocimiento sobre innovaci籀n y lo que se requiere para introducir nuevas ideas en el mercado, describe las 獺reas en las que la tecnolog穩a ya est獺 ayudando a reducir las emisiones, d籀nde y c籀mo la tecnolog穩a actual puede funcionar de manera m獺s eficaz, d籀nde es necesario desarrollar tecnolog穩as de punta, y qui矇n est獺 trabajando en estas innovaciones esenciales. Finalmente, presenta un plan concreto y pr獺ctico para lograr el objetivo de cero emisiones, sugiriendo no solo las pol穩ticas que los gobiernos deber穩an adoptar, sino lo que nosotros, como individuos, podemos hacer para que nuestro gobierno, nuestros empleadores y nosotros mismos nos responsabilicemos esta crucial iniciativa. Como deja claro Bill Gates, llegar a cero emisiones no ser獺 sencillo ni f獺cil, pero si seguimos el plan que aqu穩 propone, es una meta que se encuentra decididamente a nuestro alcance. ""Para detener el calentamiento global y evitar los peores efectos del cambio clim獺tico, los humanos deben dejar de agregar gases de efecto invernadero a la atm籀sfera. Si nada cambia, el mundo seguir獺 produciendo gases de efecto invernadero, el cambio clim獺tico seguir獺 empeorando y el impacto en los seres humanos con toda probabilidad ser獺 catastr籀fico.Pero las cosas pueden cambiar. Este libro trata sobre lo que se necesitar獺 para lograrlo y por qu矇 estoy convencido de que podemos hacerlo."" -- Bill Gates ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Bill Gates shares what he's learned in more than a decade of studying climate change and investing in innovations to address the problems, and sets out a vision for how the world can build the tools it needs to get to zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Bill Gates explains why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes him optimistic that the world can avoid the most dire effects of the climate crisis. Gates says, We can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. His interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it. As a technologist, he has seen firsthand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways. According to Gates, to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe.

The purpose of this book is to learn modern C-. The Modern C is C-11, 14, 17 and 20. Organized in themed chapters, this book allows beginners to edsend the language even by reading the chapters in a different order from that proposed by the author. It is the result of several years of work at the ISO standardization committee level, and the following versions, namely C-14, 17 and 20, are only the result of this effort. It should be noted, however, that C-20 is still partially implemented by market compilers, whether It's Microsoft's Visual C, Clang (LLVM) or CCG. On the cloud, everything is Server oriented and Linux reigns supreme. Whether it's multithread or asynchronous programming, with Docker or Azure, it's all about high-availability or hyper-scalabl environments.

Using the implementation of a deep learning framework as an example, C++ Template Metaprogramming in Practice: A Deep Learning Framework explains the application of metaprogramming in a relatively large project and emphasizes ways to optimize systems performance. The book is suitable for developers with a basic knowledge of C++. Developers familiar with mainstream deep learning frameworks can also refer to this book to compare the differences between the deep learning framework implemented with metaprogramming and compile-time computing with deep learning frameworks using object-oriented methods. Consisting of eight chapters, the book starts with two chapters discussing basic techniques of metaprogramming and compile-time computing. The rest of the book's chapters focus on the practical application of metaprogramming in a deep learning framework. It examines rich types and systems, expression templates, and writing complex meta-functions, as well as such topics as:    Heterogeneous dictionaries and policy templates   An introduction to deep learning   Type system and basic data types   Operations and expression templates   Basic layers   Composite and recurrent layers   Evaluation and its optimization  Metaprogramming can construct flexible and efficient code. For C++ developers who are familiar with object-oriented programming, the main difficulty in learning and mastering C++ metaprogramming is establishing the thinking mode of functional programming. The meta-programming approach involved at compile time is functional, which means that the intermediate results of the construction cannot be changed, and the impact may be greater than expected. This book enables C++ programmers to develop a functional mindset and metaprogramming skills. The book also discusses the development cost and use cost of metaprogramming and provides workarounds for minimizing these costs.

This book examines the overlapping spaces in modern Western cities to explore the small-scale processes that shaped these cities between c.1750 and 1900. It highlights the ways in which time and space matter, framing individual actions and practices and their impact on larger urban processes.It draws on the original and detailed studies of cities in Europe and North America through a micro-geographical approach to unravel urban practices, experiences and representations at three different scales: the dwelling, the street and the neighbourhood. Part I explores the changing spatiality of housing, examining the complex and contingent relationship between public and private, and commercial and domestic, as well as the relationship between representations and lived experiences. Part II delves into the street as a thoroughfare, connecting the city, but also as a site of contestation over the control and character of urban spaces. Part III draws attention to the neighbourhood as a residential grouping and as a series of spaces connecting flows of people integrating the urban space. Drawing on a range of methodologies, from space syntax and axial analysis to detailed descriptions of individual buildings, this book blends spatial theory and ideas of place with micro-history. With its fresh perspectives on the Western city created through the built environment and the everyday actions of city dwellers, the book will interest historical geographers, urban historians and architects involved in planning of cities across Europe and North America.

A charming memoir exploring the history, landscape and people of rural France, told through the eyes of a Parisian-born Englishman, writer and poet. Adam Thorpe's home for the past 25 years has been an old house in the C矇vennes, a wild range of mountains in southern France. Prior to this, in an ancient millhouse in the oxbow of a C矇venol river, he wrote the novel that would become the Booker Prize-nominated Ulverton, now a Vintage Classic. In more recent writing Thorpe has explored the C矇vennes, drawing on the legends, history and above all the people of this part of France for his inspiration. In his charming journal,  Notes from the C矇vennes, Thorpe takes up these themes, writing about his surroundings, the village and his house at the heart of it, as well as the contrasts of city life in nearby N簾mes. In particular he is interested in how the past leaves impressions--marks--on our landscape and on us. What do we find in the grass, earth and stone beneath our feet and in the objects around us? How do they tie us to our forebears? What traces have been left behind and what marks do we leave now? Part celebration of both rustic and urban France, part memoir, Thorpe's humorous and precise prose shows a wonderful stylist at work, recalling classics such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey in the C矇vennes.

Use this book to learn how to accelerate C++ programs using data parallelism. Data parallelism in C++ enables access to parallel resources in a modern heterogeneous system, freeing the programmer from being locked into any particular computing device. Now a single C++ application can use any combination of devices--including GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs and AI ASICs--that are suitable to the problems at hand. This book teaches data-parallel programming using C++ and the SYCL standard from the Khronos Group, and walks through everything needed to use SYCL for programming heterogeneous systems. SYCL programs perform best when paired with SYCL-aware C++ compilers such as the open source Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) compiler used in this book. The material in this book is approachable to both those new to data-parallel programming and seasoned parallel programming veterans. It is full of practical advice, detailed explanations, and code examples to illustrate key topics. This book begins by introducing data parallelism and foundational topics for effective use of SYCL and DPC++. Later chapters cover advanced topics including error handling, hardware-specific programming, communication and synchronization, and memory model considerations. This open access book enables C++ programmers to be at the forefront of this exciting and important new development that is helping to push computing to new levels.  What You'll Learn How to accelerate C++ programs using data-parallel programming How to target multiple device types (e.g. CPU, GPU, FPGA) How to use SYCL and SYCL compilers How to connect with computing's heterogeneous future via Intel's oneAPI initiative   Who This Book Is For Computer programmers interested in data-parallel programming using C++.

Programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update. Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&& comes before -- comes before ?: ). The practical programmer reduces these to two: Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction etc.

Organic synthesis is, at its core, an endeavor in composition, and, as such, is a creative field of almost limitless scope, especially when applied to complex molecules whose primary element is carbon, collectively known as organic compounds. Organic-chemical synthesis performed through one-pot, tandem, domino or cascade reactions have become a significant area of research in organic chemistry since such processes improve atom economy. Cascade reactions constitute a fascinating branch of organic chemistry, and one which has been the subject of intense research in recent years.

All the new language and library features of C++17 (for those who know the previous versions of C++).C++17 is the next evolution in modern C++ programming, which is already now supported by the latest version of gcc, clang, and Visual C++. Although it is not as big a step as C++11, it contains a large number of small and valuable language and library features, which will change the way we program in C++. As usual, not everything is self-explanatory, combining new features gives even more power, and there are hidden traps.This book presents all the new language and library features of C++17. It covers the motivation and context of each new feature with examples and background information. The focus is on how these features impact day-to-day programming, what it means to combine them, and how to benefit from this in practice.

The Raspberry Pi makes an ideal match for the Internet of Things. But to put it to good use in IoT you need two areas of expertise, electronics and programming and, because of the way hardware and software engineering tend to occupy separate niches, you may need help with combining the two. This book teaches you to think like an IoT programmer.In Raspberry Pi IoT in C you will find a practical approach to understanding electronic circuits and datasheets and translating this to code, specifically using the C programming language. The main reason for choosing C is speed, a crucial factor when you are writing programs to communicate with the outside world. If you are familiar with another programming language, C shouldn't be hard to pick up. This Second Edition has been brought up-to-date and focuses mainly on the Pi 4 and the Pi Zero. There is new material on the recently introduced GPIO character driver and using the Pi 4's additional ports and scheduling.Although NetBeans is used to develop programs, VS Code is now considered an alternative remote development environment and all the book's code, which is available for download, has been tested with VS Code.The main idea in this book is to not simply install a driver, but to work directly with the hardware using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) to connect with off-the-shelf sensors. It explains how to use its standard output with custom protocols, including an in-depth exposition of the 1-wire bus. You will also discover how to put the Internet into the IoT using sockets.After reading this book you will be in a better position to tackle interfacing anything-with-anything without the need for custom drivers and prebuilt hardware modules.Harry Fairhead has worked with microprocessors and electronics in general for many years and is an enthusiastic proponent of the IoT. As well as being the Editor of IoT-Programmer.com, he is a regular contributor to I-Programmer.info, where he covers all aspects of hardware. His other recent books include Applying C For The IoT With Linux as well as  Fundamental C: Getting Closer To The Machine and Micro: bit IoT in C.

This textbook is an ideal introduction in college courses or self-study for learning computer programming using the C language. Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author's many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.

Discover everything you need to know about C++ in a logical progression of small lessons that you can work through as quickly or as slowly as you need. This book divides C++ up into bite-sized chunks that will help you learn the language one step at a time. Fully updated to include C++20, it assumes no familiarity with C++ or any other C-based language. Exploring C++20 acknowledges that C++ can be a complicated language, so rather than baffle you with complex chapters explaining functions, classes, and statements in isolation you'll focus on how to achieve results. By learning a little bit of this and a little of that you'll soon have amassed enough knowledge to be writing non-trivial programs and will have built a solid foundation of experience that puts those previously baffling concepts into context.In this fully-revised third edition of Exploring C++, you'll learn how to use the standard library early in the book. Next, you'll work with operators, objects, and data-sources in increasingly realistic situations. Finally, you'll start putting the pieces together to create sophisticated programs of your own design confident that you've built a firm base of experience from which to grow.What You Will Learn Grasp the basics, including compound statements, modules, and more Work with custom types and see how to use them Write useful algorithms, functions, and moreDiscover the latest C++ 20 features, including concepts, modules, and ranges Apply your skills to projects that include a fixed-point numbers and body-mass index applications Carry out generic programming and apply it in a practical project Exploit multiple inheritance, traits/policies, overloaded functions, and metaprogramming Who This Book Is ForExperienced programmers who may have little or no experience with C++ who want an accelerated learning guide to C++20 so they can hit the ground running.

Our aim is to develop a process to measure and supervise parameters of remote photovoltaic stations, in order to transmit it via radio to the operator. The management of data coming from different parts is operated by PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). PLC uses MODBUS: it's a simple and robust serial protocol with master/slave hierarchy (RS485) deployed on a serial link, asynchronous, differential (up to 10 Megabits/s). Every PV station will contain necessary sensors and detectors to supervise electric and solar parameters in order to give elementary digital flows. These flows will be directed to make terminal stream by using appropriate multiplexing step by step. After, this transport stream TS will be broadcasted using specific support which constitutes our new idea proposed in this book: Indeed, we propose to make process based on the TS and put it over 57 KHz subscriber available in FM multiplex spectrum as it was detailed in the papers.

The spreading of resistance to antibiotics has fascinated the researcher to develop new antibiotics. However, it is predicted from history that new antimicrobials will have a short life. Thus, resistance to new drugs leads to a shortage of antimicrobials as the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs is not enough to cope with the fast emergence of resistant strains. This requires new potent antimicrobial compounds as an alternative to existing antibiotics. Phytochemicals having a low molecular weight, could be an alternative source of antimicrobials. Natural molecules are a more promising source of drugs. Natural molecules have a diverse chemical structure and biochemical specificity. Biologically active natural molecules usually have low molecular weight; they are easily absorbed and metabolized in the body. Major resources of natural molecules include plants, marine organisms and microbes. The plant produces innumerable secondary metabolites with several biological activities. Hence, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of plants for the development of new therapeutic agents.

C籀rdoba is a central province in Argentina, where fires in rural areas and nature reserves have increased in frequency and intensity in the last years. Among other variables, soil degradation by fire affects the dynamics of organic matter, which can substantially change its quantity and quality in short and long term. The humic substances, whose most important components are fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA) are the most resistant fractions to biodegradation. These fractions play a fundamental role in the soil through their chemical reactivity. The objective of this work was to analyze the changes in the chemical and physical-chemical properties of HA extracted from fire-affected soils, with extensive crops (soybeans and corn) and native forests without intervention. The information obtained, with different methodologies, shows the influence on the soil properties, of the different surface vegetable residues present at the fire event.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) evolution is a highly dynamic process. There is little information about molecular epidemiology of HCV isolates in Morocco, an area known for an intermediate prevalence of HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the subtype distribution of HCV strains in patients with chronic HCV infection in Morocco and to estimate the prevalence of amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region in treatment-naive patients from Morocco. In this study, we have included 185 anti-HCV positive patients. The identification of HCV subtype was respectively performed by sequencing of the 5'UTR, core and NS5B regions. HCV demographic history was inferred using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on NS5B region revealed that subtype 1b (75.2%) was the most common followed by subtype 2i (19.1%). HCV subtype 1b had an even higher prevalence in hepatocellular carcinoma. Using a Bayesian approach, the mean date of appearance of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be 1910 for HCV-1b and 1854 for HCV-2i. Based on core region, mutations at R70Q or L91M were detected in more than one fourth of patients infected with HCV-1b.

The work presented here includes an investigation of the relationship between hyperglycemia-induced local vitamin C deficiency in the eyes of diabetics and diabetic eye complications through epigenetics. Methylcytosine (5mC) and hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are the main covalent modifications of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are maintained by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) enzymes. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for the TET enzymes and when a deficiency presents it results in a disruption of the methylation/demethylation dynamics. In this work, retinal cells are cultured either in a deficiency or sufficiency of vitamin C and the hydroxymethylome and transcriptome are investigated. The most interesting finding is that a deficiency of vitamin C leads to an overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has long been implicated in diabetic eye complications. This suggests that a correction of the local vitamin C deficiency could prevent or possibly even ameliorate symptoms of diabetic retinopathy.

The study of 'Problem solving and Programming in C' is fundamental to computer science and engineering. This is essential for us to develop computer programs that utilize computer resources in an effective manner. The practical orientation of this book is due, so my tendency is to design things from an engineering point of view, always balancing the ideals of theory with the reality of practice. The engineer in me has always been eager to understand the trade-offs involved in using one approach over another.Problem solving and Programming in C has been developed for use in programs that cover this material in a unified course as well as in programs that spread out over two or more courses.This book is written primarily for freshmen students taking up their first course in programming, but people who are interested in learning C are also welcome to study it. Its aim is to supplement classroom lectures by focusing on C programming. Topics are arranged based on the order of class discussion. The book has been designed to be useful to both those programmers with little C experience as well as those new to the programming.

Agroforestry is a land - use system that involves deliberate retention, introduction, or a mixture of trees or other woody perennials in crop/animal production systems to benefit from the resultant ecological and economic interactions. Nitrogen and carbon is an essential nutrient element for organisms and is a key factor controlling plant growth and soil microbial activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. In general, plant growth and microbial activity are limited by low availability of N and C, especially in terrestrial ecosystems where low temperature restricts N and C mineralization and where most N is trapped in soil organic forms that are unavailable to plants. Agroforestry is helpful to stimulate these ecosystem services. Therefore, knowledge of N retention and turnover processes in soil and the factors controlling these processes are very important to better understand terrestrial N and C cycle and its potential response to global change.

In this volume the radiation performance of a coaxial feed dual wideband dual polarized stacked microstrip patch antenna for S and C band wireless communication using electromagnetic simulation tool IE3D (Integral Equation Three-Dimensional) and CST-MWS (Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio) is offered and discussed. The attempt is made to compare the antenna parameters such gain, impedance bandwidth and radiation pattern from both the Electromagnetic Software. Theoretical analysis of the stacked microstrip patch antenna is discussed and a portion of the well-known and generally utilized antenna analysis techniques and their highlights is also included. A prototype antenna is fabricated and its experimental results in compared with simulation results is also presented to validate the offered design. The structural arrangement gives rise a wide impedance bandwidth in two bands 3.14-4.13GHz (27.2%) with linear polarization in S band and 6.16-7.01GHz (12.8%) with circular polarization in C band respectively. It is recommended that IE3D is suitable if the ground and substrate size has no size constrain, however for finite size geometry configuration CST is a better choice.

Discover a variety of data-mining algorithms that are useful for selecting small sets of important features from among unwieldy masses of candidates, or extracting useful features from measured variables.  As a serious data miner you will often be faced with thousands of candidate features for your prediction or classification application, with most of the features being of little or no value. You'll know that many of these features may be useful only in combination with certain other features while being practically worthless alone or in combination with most others. Some features may have enormous predictive power, but only within a small, specialized area of the feature space. The problems that plague modern data miners are endless. This book helps you solve this problem by presenting modern feature selection techniques and the code to implement them. Some of these techniques are: Forward selection component analysis Local feature selection Linking features and a target with a hidden Markov model Improvements on traditional stepwise selection Nominal-to-ordinal conversion All algorithms are intuitively justified and supported by the relevant equations and explanatory material. The author also presents and explains complete, highly commented source code.  The example code is in C++ and CUDA C but Python or other code can be substituted; the algorithm is important, not the code that's used to write it.  What You Will Learn  Combine principal component analysis with forward and backward stepwise selection to identify a compact subset of a large collection of variables that captures the maximum possible variation within the entire set. Identify features that may have predictive power over only a small subset of the feature domain. Such features can be profitably used by modern predictive models but may be missed by other feature selection methods. Find an underlying hidden Markov model that controls the distributions of feature variables and the target simultaneously. The memory inherent in this method is especially valuable in high-noise applications such as prediction of financial markets. Improve traditional stepwise selection in three ways: examine a collection of 'best-so-far' feature sets; test candidate features for inclusion with cross validation to automatically and effectively limit model complexity; and at each step estimate the probability that our results so far could be just the product of random good luck. We also estimate the probability that the improvement obtained by adding a new variable could have been just good luck. Take a potentially valuable nominal variable (a category or class membership) that is unsuitable for input to a prediction model, and assign to each category a sensible numeric value that can be used as a model input.   Who This Book Is For  Intermediate to advanced data science programmers and analysts. C++ and CUDA C experience is highly recommended. However, this book can be used as a framework using other languages such as Python.

In this research work, thorough study has been conducted to decrease the porosity that arises during high pressure die casting. ANASYS (15.0), a computer aided engineering software has been used to reduce the porosity defect that arises during casting process. The reading, dimensions and specifications of the injection chamber have been taken from a die casting machining plant. The main objective is to reduce porosity from the end product which is a 100 watt LED light frame in this case. The changes in the pressure of molten metal flow has been observed inside the injection chamber which has been modeled using ANSYS fluent. And it has been found that when the pressure of molten metal flow is reduced, porosity also tends to get reduced or completely vanished. Nondestructive testing (NDT) is the process of inspecting, with the help of NDT testing we can find the inner defect of the casting and any other product like Porosity defect this defect. In this research work we find the minimum porosity with the help of NDT and we are using X-ray radiography testing. Radiography testing is the part of NDT so finally we have decreased the porosity.

It provides you with an adequate understanding of the programming language. From there, you can bring yourself towards a higher level of expertise. While you are not really required to have any previous experience with computer programming, you still need to have a basic understanding of the terms commonly used in programming and computers.You see, the C language is one of the most recommended computer programming languages for beginners. After all, it is a predecessor to many of the modern programming languages used today, such as Java and Python. In other words, before you can effectively learn these languages, you have to have a clear understanding of the C language first.Through this book, you will learn how to write your first programs and see how they work in real time. You have to keep in mind that it is perfectly okay to make mistakes every now and then. It is through these mistakes that you learn. So, when you encounter an error on your program, you just have to study the part where you went wrong and redo it. When you run the programs in the C language, you will be notified in case you made a mistake. You will see the error and know which line you have to modify.This book features Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sections that are written with beginners like you in mind. The author understands that beginners may have certain questions with regard to the elements of C that are not often discussed in books.This book also teaches you how you can write the shortest programs possible, without negatively affecting your output. As a programmer, you want to make the most of your available time and space while still being efficient.

This book is directed towards graduate students that wish to start from the basic theory of C*-algebras and advance to an overview of some of the most spectacular results concerning the structure of nuclear C*-algebras.The text is divided into three parts. First, elementary notions, classical theorems and constructions are developed. Then, essential examples in the theory, such as crossed products and the class of quasidiagonal C*-algebras, are examined, and finally, the Elliott invariant, the Cuntz semigroup, and the Jiang-Su algebra are defined. It is shown how these objects have played a fundamental role in understanding the fine structure of nuclear C*-algebras. To help understanding the theory, plenty of examples, treated in detail, are included. This volume will also be valuable to researchers in the area as a reference guide. It contains an extensive reference list to guide readers that wish to travel further.

This book provides a comprehensive, updated syntheses of all the information available on Mar Chiquita, covering various aspects of the geography, geological history, biology and ecology of the site, as well as a detailed analysis of the current land-use patterns, environmental threats, and conservation issues. Mar Chiquita, located in the province of Cordoba, Argentina, is a protected wilderness area that includes South America's largest saline lake and wetland. It has a very rich bird biodiversity, including three of the six species of flamingos that exist in the world, and high numbers of intercontinental migratory shorebirds. For this reason, the area has been declared an International Site by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, and also a Site of Hemispheric Importance by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves Network. Largely unknown until very recently, particularly in terms of the English literature, the site is rapidly gaining international visibility, not only in terms of scientific research, but also as site of interest for the nature lovers around the globe. Written in a language accessible to the non-specialists, the book focuses on integrating the dynamic, functional processes in the ecosystem, while at the same time providing the necessary descriptive information. Accordingly, it is of interest to scientists from diverse disciplines interested in saline wetlands, as well as to students, managers, and the general public.

In una rete un host mittente 癡 connesso direttamente al cosiddetto default router origine (o di primo hop) presente nel suo segmento di rete e ad esso trasferisce tutti i pacchetti che deve spedire. Il problema da risolvere, che 癡 quello di instradare un pacchetto tra host di origine e quello di destinazione, si riconduce chiaramente al problema d'instradare il pacchetto tra questi due router. Effettuare l'instradamento di un pacchetto in una rete equivale a individuare un ""percorso"" tra sorgente e destinazione: inoltre il cammino ricercato deve essere il pi羅 corto possibile, cio癡 siamo alla ricerca di un cammino minimo.Concettualmente possiamo identificare una rete di elaboratori con una struttura dinamica informatica (o matematica) particolare, il grafo. Quindi, effettuare la ricerca del cammino minimo tra due router equivale a quella di un cammino minimo in un grafo.

Let's be very honest, a programming language cannot be learned in ""one day"" or ""fast"". You will need lots of examples and practice to learn C#, especially if you are beginner. Beware of other shorter books that only touch on the topic and do not provide enough exercises or examples. This book was designed to make concepts as easy as possible, while explaining how programming works. This guide is different from others in that it includes a variety of different exercises that readers can learn from.  You no longer have to waste your money on books that are are only 200 pages and do not deliver enough value. You deserve better.

The present experiment entitled ""Effect of Different Levels of Vitamin C on Performance of Broilers"" was carried out in small animal laboratory of Sunderesan School of Animal Husbandry & Dairying. Poultry has a crucial place in India as the eggs and chicken meat are important and rich sources of protein, vitamins and minerals. Poultry provides rich organic manure and is an important source of income and employment to millions of farmers and other persons engaged in allied activities in the poultry industry. Chicken is the most widely accepted meat in India. Unlike beef or pork, it does not have a religious taboo. The prices of chicken meat are lower than those of mutton or goat meat. Many Indian families, especially the educated people in urban areas, have begun to accept eggs as a regular supplemental part of their vegetarian diet .The forecast surveys indicate that as the present younger generation goes to the adulthood, the acceptability and demand for eggs and chicken meat in next 2-3 decades is likely to increase many-folds very rapidly.

Learn applied numerical computing using the C programming language, starting with a quick primer on the C programming language and its SDK. This book then dives into progressively more complex applied math formula for computational methods using C with examples throughout and a larger, more complete application towards the end. Numerical C starts with the quadratic formula for finding solutions to algebraic equations that model things such as price vs. demand or rise vs. run or slip and more. Later in the book, you'll work on the augmented matrix method for simultaneous equations. You'll also cover Monte Carlo method model objects that could arise naturally as part of the modeling of a real-life system, such as a complex road network, the transport of neutrons, or the evolution of the stock market. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo method of integration examines the area under a curve including rendering or ray tracing and the shading in a region. Furthermore, you'll work with the product moment correlation coefficient: correlation is a technique for investigating the relationship between two quantitative, continuous variables, for example, age and blood pressure. By the end of the book, you'll have a feeling for what computer software could do to help you in your work and apply some of the methods learned directly to your work. What You Will LearnGain software and C programming basicsWrite software to solve applied, computational mathematics problems Create programs to solve equations and calculus problems Use the trapezium method, Monte Carlo method, line of best fit, product moment correlation coefficient, Simpson's rule, and matrix solutions Write code to solve differential equations Apply one or more of the methods to an application case studyWho This Book Is ForThose with an existing knowledge of rudimentary mathematics (school level) and some basic programming experience. This is also important to people who may work in mathematics or other areas (for example, life sciences, engineering, or economics) and need to learn C programming.

In the last few decades, research on the elaboration by palladium-catalytic processes of C-C bonds or the activation of C-H bonds has increased considerably. Yet there is still room for much improvement in terms of selectivity, or enantioselectivity, via the development of new ligands or the study of the catalytic effect of other metals to carry out the same chemical transformations. In addition, the attention paid to environmentally friendly methods in terms of the quantities of catalysts, ligands, and solvents is currently indispensable. The Mizoroki-Heck reaction is one of these important catalytic methods which generates C-C bonds in organic synthesis and is also possible by C-H activation. This book, titled ""Catalyzed Mizoroki-Heck Reaction or C-H activation"" focuses on new advances in the formation of C-C bonds or new C-H activation methods. It contains original research papers and short reviews on the synthesis of biologically active compounds using these catalytic processes, the identification of new catalysts, of new conditions allowing selectivity or enantioselectivity, the activity and stability of catalyst under turnover conditions, and all improvements in catalytic processes.

Currently, the exploit of nanomaterials in the field of luminescence has been tremendously increased due to their unique properties. Rare-earth cations in different host lattices was prompted the development of rare- earth luminescent materials for lasers, lamps, CRTs, dosimeters, scintillators, display systems, sensors, memory devices, white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) etc. Nanophosphors can be applied in various fields due to reduction of the particle size of the crystalline system which considerably alter its optical and electronic properties, large surface to volume ratio and quantum confinement effect.The unique spectroscopic properties of rare-earth ions in different host lattices were prompted the development of rare- earth luminescent materials for display and lighting applications. WLEDs were the potential materials for significantly improving lighting efficiency, resulting in reduction of the excitation energy and also reduction in pollution from fossil fuel power plants.

Carbon is everywhere: in the paper of this book and the blood of our bodies. It's with us from beginning to end, present in our baby clothes and coffin alike. We live on a carbon planet, and we are carbon life. No other element is so central to our well-being; yet, when missing or misaligned, carbon atoms can also bring about disease and even death. At once ubiquitous and mysterious, carbon holds the answers to some of humanity's biggest questions. Where did Earth come from? What will ultimately become of it--and of us? With poetic storytelling, earth scientist Robert M. Hazen explores the universe to discover the past, present, and future of life's most essential element.We're not only ""made of star stuff,"" as Carl Sagan famously observed, but ""Big Bang stuff,"" too. Hazen reveals that carbon's grand symphony began with a frenzied prelude shortly after the dawn of creation, bringing new attention to the tiny number of Big Bang-created carbon atoms that often get overlooked. In minutes, violently colliding protons and neutrons improbably formed the first carbon atoms, which can still be found within our bodies. His book then unfolds in four movements, building momentum as he explores carbon as the element of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.He visits the famed volcanic crater Solfatara di Pozzuoli near Naples, where venting carbon dioxide and other noxious fumes condense into beautiful crystals. He climbs the cliffs of the Scottish Highlands and delves deep into the precious-metal mines of Namibia, journeying toward Earth's mysterious core in search of undocumented carbon structures.Hazen often asks us to pause and consider carbon's role in climate change and what we can do about it, for our lives and this element are inextricably intertwined. With prose that sparkles like a diamond, Symphony in C tells the story of carbon, in which we all have a part.

Master's Thesis from the year 2016 in the subject Geography / Earth Science - Physical Geography, Geomorphology, Environmental Studies, grade: 4.0, Addis Ababa University, language: English, abstract: This research was conducted with the objective analyzing local level coping and adaptation strategies in the agriculture sector in responses to climate extremes impacts on agricultural production by smallholder farmers in Soddo district of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia. The study employed household survey, FGD and KI interview for data collection. Climate change contributed to increased incidence and expansion of crop pests (locusts), reduced crop yield, short length of growing period, change in production season, reduce livestock weight, deterioration of cattle health and death, water scarcity, and shortage of grazing land and feed as major effects in crop and livestock production. Climate has obvious and direct effects on agricultural production. Agricultural sector in Sub-Saharan African is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Climate change is a key concern to Ethiopia since agriculture sector of the country is the most affected sector by climate change. Thus identifying different adaptation options to climatic variation is crucial in designing appropriate coping strategies.

Although power method polynomials based on the standard normal distributions have been used in many different contexts for the past 30 years, it was not until recently that the probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) were derived and made available. Focusing on both univariate and multivariate nonnormal data generation, Statistical Simulation: Power Method Polynomials and Other Transformations presents techniques for conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study. It shows how to use power method polynomials for simulating univariate and multivariate nonnormal distributions with specified cumulants and correlation matrices.The book first explores the methodology underlying the power method, before demonstrating this method through examples of standard normal, logistic, and uniform power method pdfs. It also discusses methods for improving the performance of a simulation based on power method polynomials. The book then develops simulation procedures for systems of linear statistical models, intraclass correlation coefficients, and correlated continuous variates and ranks. Numerical examples and results from Monte Carlo simulations illustrate these procedures. The final chapter describes how the g-and-h and generalized lambda distribution (GLD) transformations are special applications of the more general multivariate nonnormal data generation approach. Throughout the text, the author employs Mathematica(R) in a range of procedures and offers the source code for download online.Written by a longtime researcher of the power method, this book explains how to simulate nonnormal distributions via easy-to-use power method polynomials. By using the methodology and techniques developed in the text, readers can evaluate different transformations in terms of comparing percentiles, measures of central tendency, goodness-of-fit tests, and more.

Every year, droughts, floods, and fires impact hundreds of millions of people and cause massive economic losses. Climate change is making these catastrophes more dangerous. Now. Not in the future: NOW. This book describes how and why climate change is already fomenting dire consequences, and will certainly make climate disasters worse in the near future. Chris C. Funk combines the latest science with compelling stories, providing a timely, accessible, and beautifully-written synopsis of this critical topic. The book describes our unique and fragile Earth system, and the negative impacts humans are having on our support systems. It then examines recent disasters, including heat waves, extreme precipitation, hurricanes, fires, El Ni簽os and La Ni簽as, and their human consequences. By clearly describing the dangerous impacts that are already occurring, Funk provides a clarion call for social change, yet also conveys the beauty and wonder of our planet, and hope for our collective future.

The method of compensated compactness as a technique for studying hyperbolic conservation laws is of fundamental importance in many branches of applied mathematics. Until now, however, most accounts of this method have been confined to research papers. Offering the first comprehensive treatment, Hyperbolic Conservation Laws and the Compensated Compactness Method gathers together into a single volume the essential ideas and developments. The authors begin with the fundamental theorems, then consider the Cauchy problem of the scalar equation, build a framework for L8 estimates of viscosity solutions, and introduce the Invariant Region Theory. The study then turns to methods for symmetric systems of two equations and two equations with quadratic flux, and the extension of these methods to the Le Roux system. After examining the system of polytropic gas dynamics (g-law), the authors first study two special systems of one-dimensional Euler equations, then consider the general Euler equations for one-dimensional compressible fluid flow, and extend that method to systems of elasticity in L8 space. Weak solutions for the elasticity system are introduced and an application to adiabatic gas flow through porous media is considered. The final four chapters explore applications of the compensated compactness method to the relaxation problem. With its careful account of the underlying ideas, development of applications in key areas, an inclusion of the author's own contributions to the field, this monograph will prove a welcome addition to the literature and to your library.

This book provides a comprehensive, updated syntheses of all the information available on Mar Chiquita, covering various aspects of the geography, geological history, biology and ecology of the site, as well as a detailed analysis of the current land-use patterns, environmental threats, and conservation issues. Mar Chiquita, located in the province of Cordoba, Argentina, is a protected wilderness area that includes South America's largest saline lake and wetland. It has a very rich bird biodiversity, including three of the six species of flamingos that exist in the world, and high numbers of intercontinental migratory shorebirds. For this reason, the area has been declared an International Site by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, and also a Site of Hemispheric Importance by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves Network. Largely unknown until very recently, particularly in terms of the English literature, the site is rapidly gaining international visibility, not only in terms of scientific research, but also as site of interest for the nature lovers around the globe. Written in a language accessible to the non-specialists, the book focuses on integrating the dynamic, functional processes in the ecosystem, while at the same time providing the necessary descriptive information. Accordingly, it is of interest to scientists from diverse disciplines interested in saline wetlands, as well as to students, managers, and the general public.

Atomic Symmetry Groups, being continuous groups, are just a fallout of the Lie Groups and Lie Algebras. Atoms are structurally simpler than molecules but atomic symmetry is more complex than molecular symmetry. In quantum mechanics we study atoms first and then the molecules. In symmetry studies, we do just the reverse. In this book, apart from theories, the description of both the symmetry groups - atomic and molecular, are attended with adequate applications.Please note: Taylor & Francis does not sell or distribute the Hardback in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

How can we defuse extremism, spur positive action, and win allies in the fight against climate change? Ask United Nations Champion of the Earth and World Evangelical Alliance climate ambassador Katharine Hayhoe. As a Canadian living in Texas, climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe has learned how to successfully navigate the political minefield of the climate change debate. She negotiates skepticism of the science, indifference to the harmful impacts, and resistance to the actions needed to avoid those risks. Rejecting scare tactics or guilt trips, Katharine engages with the cautious and the doubtful by finding shared values--and she says you can, too. In The Answer to Climate Change, Hayhoe shares her journey in talking about climate. The result is an engaging look at science, faith, and human psychology, without the political theater. Katharine argues that alarmism around climate turns off the undecided and promotes hopelessness among those who want to bring about change. So, how do we start a meaningful and productive conversation with our families, friends and colleagues about climate change? With warmth and humanity, Katharine shows how all of us can, and why all of us must, play a role in saving our future.

​In recent years there has been significant attention paid on the endophytic research by various groups working within this domain. Mutualistic endophytic microbes with an emphasis on the relatively understudied fungal endophytes are the focus of this special book. Plants are associated with micro-organisms: endophytic bacteria and fungi, which live inter- and intra-cellularly without inducing pathogenic symptoms, but have active biochemical and genetic interactions with their host. Endophytes play vital roles as plant growth promoters, biocontrol agents, biosurfactant producers, enzymes and secondary metabolite producers, as well as providing a new hidden repertoire of bioactive natural products with uses in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and other biotechnological applications. The increasing interest in endophytic research generates significant progress in our understanding of the host-endophyte relationship at molecular and genetic level. The bio-prospection of microbial endophytes has led to exciting possibilities for their biotechnological application as biocontrol agent, bioactive metabolites, and other useful traits. Apart from these virtues, the microbial endophytes may be adapted to the complex metabolism of many desired molecules that can be of significant industrial applications. These microbes can be a useful alternative for sustainable solutions for ecological control of pests and diseases, and can reduce the burden of excess of chemical fertilizers for this purpose. This book is an attempt to review the recent development in the understanding of microbial endophytes and their potential biotechnological applications. This is a collection of literature authored by noted researchers having signatory status in endophytic research and summarizes the development achieved so far, and future prospects for further research in this fascinating area of research.

	結合108高中進階程式設計課綱與APCS考試範圍，並將APCS試題分類講解。

	本書依照108 課綱，『高中進階程式設計』課綱編輯而成。那為什麼選C 語言作為高中生進階程式設計教材呢? 因為C 語言的優點如下：

	1. C 語言還是目前程式設計主流，大學端設計的『大學程式設計先修檢測APCS』的學科也以C 語言為程式設計語言，所以學習C 語言可完全無縫銜接高中與大學程式設計課程。

	2. 整合編輯視窗（簡稱IDE）較精簡。目前大部分程式語言，因其輸出入物件非常完整，相對的其整合編輯視窗也非常複雜，這樣容易眼花繚亂，不易入門，C 語言則較為精簡，這樣有助於中學生先專注於程式設計的運算思維。

	3. 語言簡單而實用。因為C 是結構化語言，且中學生主要是學程式基本運算、決策、迴圈、陣列、資料結構、演算法等程式設計運算思維， C 語言可說綽綽有餘，反觀一些視窗化程式語言，一開門就先複雜的輸出入物件與事件，這樣反而容易眼花繚亂，轉移了學習焦點。

	4. C 語言很有效率，幾乎和組合語言一樣快。

本書特色

	1. 內容豐富。本書不僅按照高中進階程式設計課綱編輯而成，也將APCS 考試題目當範例，所以不僅可以達成進階程式設計能力，也可直接參加APCS 測驗。

	2. 課程銜接。本書以中學生資訊科技為基礎，向上也完全銜接APCS 考試範圍，語言也同步APCS 學科試題，這樣APCS考試的學科與實作才不會錯亂，可在很短的時間內拿到高分。

	3. 程式來龍去脈很清楚。大部分的電腦書都是文字敘述完，就跑出一長串程式，讀者根本喘不過氣。本書則是一面說明、一面寫程式，所以程式的來龍去脈特別清楚。

	4. 具有充分的範例。本書主要闡述基礎資料結構、基礎演算法的經典範例，其次APCS 實作題也是以此為命題範圍，本書均將這些題目放在相關範例後面，這樣可以加強這些經典演算法的應用。

	5. 充分的自我練習。學程式設計不是一直聽老師解說，而是需要不斷練習，不斷練習自己排除錯誤，所以本書想出很多與範例非常相近的自我練習讓學生練習，希望老師一定要放手讓學生作，學生也不要指望老師幫您解答，只有不斷練習才會進步；也不要認為前面簡單就不作，因為這樣您不會基本除錯。短時間作不出來也不要氣餒，反覆思考就會有靈感。也千萬不要看別人解答，因為每人的想法不同，看了解答那思緒就被牽絆了，反正自己想，各憑本事，那才有開竅頓悟的快樂。

	6. 字體適中。體認老師因長年不斷教學準備，眼睛大多老花了，所以本公司不惜成本，將字體放大，希望能減輕老師的負擔。

	7. 本書標示『※』為進階單元，請任課教師依照上課時數衡量。

The use of renewable energy sources (RESs) is a need of global society. This editorial, and its associated Special Issue ""Grid-Connected Renewable Energy Sources"", offers a compilation of some of the recent advances in the analysis of current power systems that are composed after the high penetration of distributed generation (DG) with different RESs. The focus is on both new control configurations and on novel methodologies for the optimal placement and sizing of DG. The eleven accepted papers certainly provide a good contribution to control deployments and methodologies for the allocation and sizing of DG.

This is a practical guide to P-splines, a simple, flexible and powerful tool for smoothing. P-splines combine regression on B-splines with simple, discrete, roughness penalties. They were introduced by the authors in 1996 and have been used in many diverse applications. The regression basis makes it straightforward to handle non-normal data, like in generalized linear models. The authors demonstrate optimal smoothing, using mixed model technology and Bayesian estimation, in addition to classical tools like cross-validation and AIC, covering theory and applications with code in R. Going far beyond simple smoothing, they also show how to use P-splines for regression on signals, varying-coefficient models, quantile and expectile smoothing, and composite links for grouped data. Penalties are the crucial elements of P-splines; with proper modifications they can handle periodic and circular data as well as shape constraints. Combining penalties with tensor products of B-splines extends these attractive properties to multiple dimensions. An appendix offers a systematic comparison to other smoothers.

It took a crop failure to learn my biggest lesson in farming: Row-cropping was an expensive gamble - but raising cattle on grass alone is almost guaranteed income.The next couple of decades proved my observation right.What people think is modern farming can lead them to bankruptcy, but grazing cattle according to Nature's principles makes farming income - and profits - predictable.In this short volume are the condensed lessons on how rotational grazing with inexpensive portable electric fencing has made farming easier, more enjoyable, and completely sustainable.The land is gradually producing more and more each year, while the soil beneath it regains its life. More grass means more cattle it can support, and means more profit every year.You get to walk in Nature every day, while your farming ""job"" requires few machines or chemicals while it pays you with fresh air, exercise, healthy food, and enough income to farm worry-free. Almost regardless of the weather or market prices.If - you study the land, and it's grass, and it's animals.Here is a condensed set of lessons I've learned over two decades. More than I've told anyeone - even though who have gone along this journey with me. Compiled into a single book for you to read. Compare your notes with mine. I've found sustainable, eco-positive way to heal the earth and make a decent living without stress.You can, too.Excerpt: Some two decades ago, I escaped the big city and returned to our family farm to take over running it. We were doing corn-soybean row-cropping and ""fat"" cattle as a side operation. Once I worked out that the farm had to have external income to pay its bills, I started working backward to find out what we had to do to make the farm actually sustainable on its own.Row-cropping didn't bring enough grain in to fatten steers for market. So we would sell our grain crops and buy feed. We had ""bad years"" and even outright crop failures occasionally, where the cows ""cleaned up"" by eating the residue stalks. That's when I first saw that you didn't have ""crop failures"" with cattle on the land.As I then examined the various parts of our cattle farming methods, I found that working to fatten steers on for market ground corn and protein wasn't as profitable as just selling the yearling calves themselves. Far less inputs, but only slightly lower prices. Much higher profits. Far more sustainable.Cutting and baling hay was a trade-off, since we could graze the ground we used to grow hay on to expand our available grazing paddocks, and then reallocate the money and time we invested in getting our hay cut and baled. Plus, we were bringing someone else's minerals onto our farm through purchased hay. However, this added another 25% to the cost of the needed winter bales, which should be offset by the extra grazing.So we were now over to a simple cow-calf operation, and out of row cropping. But we still needing hay supplements to make ends meet for a third of the year when the grass didn't grow. The next focus after that was to cut down our hay costs. So we had to learn to graze better.As we did, we found ourselves answering the question of how to improve the ground from year to year to raise more grass on the same land - instead of slowly (and expensively) mining it through row-cropping or over-grazing.This is the core of regenerative grazing...Scroll Up and Get Your Copy Now.

Nosey Beast is the first comprehensive work on the coatis. Combining the results of her decades of study on wild and captive white-nosed coatis with other studies done in North, Central, and South America, Christine Hass paints the most complete picture available of these fascinating members of the raccoon family. The book provides new insights on how tropical and sub-tropical environments have influenced social behavior and communication of these gregarious animals. It examines the evolution and distribution of the several species of coatis and relates coatis to the rest of the carnivore order and the procyonid family. It takes us inside the annual cycle of the coati to provide detailed looks at coati ecology, social organization, mating patterns, food habits, ranging behavior, and relationships with predators and parasites. Throughout, it provides intimate descriptions of her primary study area, and how seasonal changes are reflected in coati behavior and ecology, especially in the timing of birth seasons. And finally, it examines their relationships with people in the past and present, including looking for archaeological evidence of coatis and examining current management practices throughout their range. Nosey Beast is a valuable reference for biologists and wildlife managers, as well as anyone interested in these attractive and entertaining mammals.

New York Times bestselling author Carl Safina brings readers close to three non-human cultures--what they do, why they do it, and how life is for them.Some people insist that culture is strictly a human feat. What are they afraid of? This book looks into three cultures of other-than-human beings in some of Earth's remaining wild places. It shows how if you're a sperm whale, a scarlet macaw, or a chimpanzee, you too experience your life with the understanding that you are an individual in a particular community. You too are who you are not by genes alone; your culture is a second form of inheritance. You receive it from thousands of individuals, from pools of knowledge passing through generations like an eternal torch. You too may raise young, know beauty, or struggle to negotiate a peace. And your culture, too, changes and evolves. The light of knowledge needs adjusting as situations change, so a capacity for learning, especially social learning, allows behaviors to adjust, to change much faster than genes alone could adapt. Becoming Wild offers a glimpse into cultures among non-human animals through looks at the lives of individuals in different present-day animal societies. By showing how others teach and learn, Safina offers a fresh understanding of what is constantly going on beyond humanity. With reporting from deep in nature, alongside individual creatures in their free-living communities, this book offers a very privileged glimpse behind the curtain of life on Earth, and helps inform the answer to that most urgent of questions: Who are we here with?

Sugarcane production range in Ethiopia is affected by weed competition periods and productivity potential of cultivated varieties under various agro-ecologies. A field experiment was carried out to determine effect of weed competition periods on growth, yield and quality parameters of sugarcane varieties at Arba Minch during 2016/2017 cropping season. The experiment was consisted of weed infested up to 30, 60, 90, 120 days after planting, weed free and unweeded, and two varieties (B52/298 and local). The treatments were laid out in RCBD replicated three times. As per the treatment, weeds were removed manually at 0, 31, 61, 91, 121 DAP, and one treatment left weedy. Data was collected on types of weeds species, weed biomass, sugarcane growth, yield, and cane yield and quality parameters. The data was analyzed statistically by using SAS statistical software version 9.2for windows. The result showed that 29 different families of weeds were identified that grow with sugarcane. Weed dry biomass production was decreased with decreasing weed competition periods and vice versa. All growth parameters were significantly affected for both varieties due to weed competition periods.

This book presents the state-of-the-art in plant ecophysiology. With a particular focus on adaptation to a changing environment, it discusses ecophysiology and adaptive mechanisms of plants under climate change. Over the centuries, the incidence of various abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, extreme temperatures, atmospheric pollution, metal toxicity due to climate change have regularly affected plants and, and some estimates suggest that environmental stresses may reduce the crop yield by up to 70%. This in turn adversely affects the food security. As sessile organisms, plants are frequently exposed to various environmental adversities. As such, both plant physiology and plant ecophysiology begin with the study of responses to the environment. Provides essential insights, this book can be used for courses such as Plant Physiology, Environmental Science, Crop Production and Agricultural Botany.Volume 1 provides up-to-date information on the impact of climate change on plants, the general consequences and plant responses to various environmental stresses.

Explore the most serious prevalent ethical issues in data science with this insightful new resource The increasing popularity of data science has resulted in numerous well-publicized cases of bias, injustice, and discrimination. The widespread deployment of ""Black box"" algorithms that are difficult or impossible to understand and explain, even for their developers, is a primary source of these unanticipated harms, making modern techniques and methods for manipulating large data sets seem sinister, even dangerous. When put in the hands of authoritarian governments, these algorithms have enabled suppression of political dissent and persecution of minorities. To prevent these harms, data scientists everywhere must come to understand how the algorithms that they build and deploy may harm certain groups or be unfair. Responsible Data Science delivers a comprehensive, practical treatment of how to implement data science solutions in an even-handed and ethical manner that minimizes the risk of undue harm to vulnerable members of society. Both data science practitioners and managers of analytics teams will learn how to:   Improve model transparency, even for black box models Diagnose bias and unfairness within models using multiple metrics Audit projects to ensure fairness and minimize the possibility of unintended harm  Perfect for data science practitioners, Responsible Data Science will also earn a spot on the bookshelves of technically inclined managers, software developers, and statisticians.

Renewable energies have become an attractive option to overcome the energy demands in sustainable and affordable ways. It has been estimated that one-third of the total renewable energies would be generated from photovoltaics (PVs). A solar or PV cell is a device that directly converts sunlight into electricity by taking benefit of the photoelectric effect. In the third-generation solar PVs, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are believed to be the most promising and have attracted wide attention. The optimization of a DSSC is focused on four main components: (i) metal oxide semiconductor, (ii) photosensitizer, (iii) redox couple electrolyte, and (iv) counter electrode. Among these, the counter electrode undertakes three functions: (i) as a catalyst, (ii) as a positive electrode of primary cells, and (iii) as a mirror. To obey these functions, the electrode material should have high catalytic activity, high conductivity, high reflectivity, high surface area, and electrochemical and mechanical stability. To improve the performance of DSSCs, many scientists have developed new counter electrodes made of platinum, carbon materials, transition metals, conductive polymers, and composites. This book converses the various aspects of materials for the fabrication of counter electrodes especially for the DSSCs.

This book focuses on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based statistical clustering technique to group the objects and improve the classification methodology. The self-organizing principle and the neighbourhood concept of ANN in Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map (SOM) are used develop a new statistical clustering technique. The proposed clustering algorithm uses statistical distance measure and the concept of neighbourhood of input vector. This algorithm is tested using some real and simulated data sets, and it has yielded better results. Textile data and finance data have used to illustrate real time applications of the proposed clustering technique. The cluster analysis can also be performed on the non-statistical data by introducing Euclidean distance measure or any such distance measure. Repeated discriminant analysis suggested in conjunction with the ANN based clustering method will be very useful for data satisfying statistical requirements.

The demand for spectral efficiency in wireless communication is ever increasing. MIMO systems are very attractive for boosting the capacity of a wireless communication link in a rich multipath environment. It has been established that using antenna arrays at transmitter and receiver, the capacity is increased. The capacity is proportional to minimum of number of transmitting elements and receiving elements that is (min(NT, NR)). The capacity of MIMO system in the real-time scattering environment is reviewed. Basic antenna configuration in this environment reduces the channel capacity and this could be improved by proper design of antenna elements

This thesis describes one of the most precise experimental tests of Lorentz symmetry in electrodynamics by light-speed anisotropy measurement with an asymmetric optical ring cavity. The author aims to answer the fundamental, hypothetical debate on Lorentz symmetry in the Universe. He concludes that the symmetry is protected within an error of 10-15, which means providing one of the most stringent upper limits on the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. It introduces the following three keys which play an important role in achieving high-precision measurement: (1) a high-index element (silicon) interpolated into part of the light paths in the optical ring cavity, which improves sensitivity to the violation of the Lorentz symmetry, (2) double-pass configuration of the interferometer, which suppresses environmental noises, and (3) continuous data acquisition by rotating the optical ring cavity, which makes it possible to search for higher-order violations of Lorentz symmetry. In addition to those well-described keys, a comprehensive summary from theoretical formulations to experimental design details, data acquisition, and data analysis helps the reader follow up the experiments precisely.

A terrifically exciting account of [Slaght's] time in the Russian Far East studying Blakiston's fish owls, huge, shaggy-feathered, yellow-eyed, and elusive birds that hunt fish by wading in icy water . . . Even on the hottest summer days this book will transport you."" --Helen Macdonald, author of H is for HawkA field scientist and conservationist tracks the elusive Blakiston's Fish Owl in the forbidding reaches of eastern Russia I saw my first Blakiston's fish owl in the Russian province of Primorye, a coastal talon of land hooking south into the belly of Northeast Asia . . . No scientist had seen a Blakiston's fish owl so far south in a hundred years . . .  When he was just a fledgling birdwatcher, Jonathan C. Slaght had a chance encounter with one of the most mysterious birds on Earth. Bigger than any owl he knew, it looked like a small bear with decorative feathers. He snapped a quick photo and shared it with experts. Soon he was on a five-year journey, searching for this enormous, enigmatic creature in the lush, remote forests of eastern Russia. That first sighting set his calling as a scientist. Despite a wingspan of six feet and a height of over two feet, the Blakiston's fish owl is highly elusive. They are easiest to find in winter, when their tracks mark the snowy banks of the rivers where they feed. They are also endangered. And so, as Slaght and his devoted team set out to locate the owls, they aim to craft a conservation plan that helps ensure the species' survival. This quest sends them on all-night monitoring missions in freezing tents, mad dashes across thawing rivers, and free-climbs up rotting trees to check nests for precious eggs. They use cutting-edge tracking technology and improvise ingenious traps. And all along, they must keep watch against a run-in with a bear or an Amur tiger. At the heart of Slaght's story are the fish owls themselves: cunning hunters, devoted parents, singers of eerie duets, and survivors in a harsh and shrinking habitat. Through this rare glimpse into the everyday life of a field scientist and conservationist, Owls of the Eastern Ice testifies to the determination and creativity essential to scientific advancement and serves as a powerful reminder of the beauty, strength, and vulnerability of the natural world.

Originally published in 1973. This book is directed to the student of philosophy whose background in mathematics is very limited. The author strikes a balance between material of a philosophical and a formal kind, and does this in a way that will bring out the intricate connections between the two. On the formal side, he gives particular care to provide the basic tools from set theory and arithmetic that are needed to study systems of logic, setting out completeness results for two, three, and four valued logic, explaining concepts such as freedom and bondage in quantificational logic, describing the intuitionistic conception of the logical operators, and setting out Zermelo's axiom system for set theory. On the philosophical side, he gives particular attention to such topics as the problem of entailment, the import of the L繹wenheim-Skolem theorem, the expressive powers of quantificational logic, the ideas underlying intuitionistic logic, the nature of set theory, and the relationship between logic and set theory.　 There are exercises within the text, set out alongside the theoretical ideas that they involve.

This book is devoted to the study of the turnpike phenomenon and describes the existence of solutions for a large variety of infinite horizon optimal control classes of problems. Chapter 1 provides introductory material on turnpike properties. Chapter 2 studies the turnpike phenomenon for discrete-time optimal control problems. The turnpike properties of autonomous problems with extended-value integrands are studied in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 focuses on large classes of infinite horizon optimal control problems without convexity (concavity) assumptions. In Chapter 5, the turnpike results for a class of dynamic discrete-time two-player zero-sum game are proven.This thorough exposition will be very useful for mathematicians working in the fields of optimal control, the calculus of variations, applied functional analysis and infinite horizon optimization. It may also be used as a primary text in a graduate course in optimal control or as supplementary text for a variety of courses in other disciplines. Researchers in other fields such as economics and game theory, where turnpike properties are well known, will also find this Work valuable.

The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) was invented by Binnig and Rohrer and received a Nobel Prize of Physics in 1986. Together with the atomic force microscope (AFM), it provides non-destructive atomic and subatomic resolution on surfaces. Especially, in recent years, internal details of atomic and molecular wavefunctions are observed and mapped with negligible disturbance. Since the publication of its first edition, this book has been the standard reference book and a graduate-level textbook educating several generations of nano-scientists. In Aug. 1992, the co-inventor of STM, Nobelist Heinrich Rohrer recommended: ""The Introduction to Scanning tunnelling Microscopy by C.J. Chen provides a good introduction to the field for newcomers and it also contains valuable material and hints for the experts"". For the second edition, a 2017 book review published in the Journal of Applied Crystallography said ""Introduction to Scanning tunnelling Microscopy is an excellent book that can serve as a standard introduction for everyone that starts working with scanning probe microscopes, and a useful reference book for those more advanced in the field"". The third edition is a thoroughly updated and improved version of the recognized ""Bible"" of the field. Additions to the third edition include: theory, method, results, and interpretations of the non-destructive observation and mapping of atomic and molecular wavefunctions; elementary theory and new verifications of equivalence of chemical bond interaction and tunnelling; scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of high Tc superconductors; imaging of self-assembled organic molecules on the solid-liquid interfaces. Some key derivations are rewritten using mathematics at an undergraduate level to make it pedagogically sound.

Environmental and specific diversity in the Chihuahuan desert in general, and in the Cuatro Ci矇negas Basin in particular, has long been recognized as outstanding. This book provides a global ecological overview, together with in-depth studies of specific processes. The Chihuahuan desert is the warmest in North America, and has a complex geologic, climatic and biogeographical history, which affects today's distribution of vegetation and plants and generates complex phylogeographic patterns. The high number of endemic species reflects this complex set of traits. The modern distribution of environments, including aquatic and subaquatic systems, riparian environments, gypsum dunes and gypsum-rich soils, low levels of phosphorous and organic matter, and high salinity combined with an extreme climate call for a range of adaptations. Plants are distributed in a patchy pattern based on punctual variations, and many of them respond to different resources and conditions with considerable morphological plasticity. In terms of physiological, morphological and ecological variability, cacti were identified as the most important group in specific environments like bajadas, characterized by high diversity values, while gypsophytes and gypsovagues of different phylogenies, including species with restricted distribution and endemics.

Aluminium alloys reinforced with ceramic oxides, carbides, nitrides and mineral silicate particulates are particularly known for their attractive characteristics. This work consists of the evaluation of corrosion behavior of Al 6061 matrix alloy reinforced with pretreated TiO2, TiN, TiC and TiB2 particulates. The electrochemical techniques employed in the studies include Open Circuit Potential measurements (OCP), Tafel polarization, and cyclic polarization and Impedance (EIS) studies. The samples were characterized by XRD and EDX analysis. The surface morphology of the samples, before and after corrosion studies, was observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The corrosion behavior of reinforced Al6061 composites was studied in acidic and salt media. A comparison of the results from all the media indicates that the relative degree of corrosion in different ionic species follows the order Cl- > NO3- > SO42-. The corrosion resistance of the particulate reinforced composites is found to increase with increase in electrical resistivity and wettability of the reinforcements TiO2, TiN, TiC and TiB2.

Energy is a key factor in day today life for all the people in the world. Decreasing the availability of fossil fuels and the rapid development of the renewable energy sources, energy storage systems become more important. Among various energy storage systems, electrochemical batteries become more promising. Among them Lithium-ion batteries become the most popular due to their excellent properties. High price, safety issues, limited natural deposit are the disadvantages of the lithium-ion battery. A good alternative would be Na since it has similar properties as Li and it is much cheaper as well as abundant. Small life time, law capacity, low voltages and poor cycling stability are the drawbacks associated with the Na ion batteries.Graphene based nano-composite materials exhibit high reversible capacities, better cycle life and good cycling stability. So, graphene/TiO2 nano-composite was used as the anode material for the sodium ion rechargeable battery in this research. This book covers the synthesis of graphene/TiO2 nano-composite and its potential application as an anode in Na-ion rechargeable battery and characterization of the battery is discussed.

Soils that contain excess soluble salts and affect plant growth adversely are called salt affected soil. Among degraded wastelands (173.08 million ha.) in India, 7.0 million ha is adversely affected with excessive soluble salts/exchangeable sodium salts, which is unsuitable to profitable crop production. There are several physical, chemical and cultural methods of improving physic-chemical and fertility status of such soil. A number of fruit trees species have been identified to have tolerance to sodic soil and have shown their potential towards reclamation of sodic soil. The potential of such tolerant fruit species in multi-tire cropping models viz. Aonla + Ber, Aonla + Guava, Aonla + Karonda, Ber + Guava + Phalsa and Aonla + Subabool in relation to changes in physic-chemical properties and improvement of fertility status of soil have been included in this book. Considering economic feasibility and ecological suitability of different cropping systems, it may be one of the new approaches towards efficient and effective methods of land reclamation of sodic lands and waste land.

Vertebrate invasive species are important ecologically, socially, and scientifically throughout much of the globe. However, the interdiction and options for management of invasive species are driven by localized regulation at the country or even state level and thus the management of species must be framed within that context. This book is focused around the management of invasive vertebrate species in the United States, although readers will find much of the material broadly applicable to invasive species in other regions. Vertebrate invasive species cause damage to agriculture, property, natural resources, and threaten human health and safety. However, most of these species occur in the United States resulting from human-mediated activities, often being released intentionally. For the first time, the wealth of scientific information about vertebrate invasive species in the United States is summarized and synthesized in a single volume to be easily accessible to ecologists and natural resource managers. With a focus on prominent terrestrial invasive species that have a history of policy and management and highlighting contemporary issues and management, this book consists of 18 chapters written by experts from across the United States. The first section of the book focuses on overarching policy and management topics associated with vertebrate invasive species; including biosecurity threats and risk assessment, policy and regulation, and the economics of their management. The second section provides in-depth reviews of noteworthy invasive mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. After finishing this book, the reader should understand the complexity of managing invasive species, the unique challenges that each new species may present, and the steps forward that may decrease the impact of these species on the environment, human health, and the economy.

Why are raccoons in the bathroom, how did they get there, and what happened to them? This book will answer those questions and tell you about Kathy Bode (and her husband, Gordon) during their first summer raising orphan raccoons. You will discover that raccoons are clever, cute, and entertaining, but do not make good pets, no matter how endearing! It takes you from a lonely, one-pound kit orphan to the release back to the wild of two teenaged, fifteen-plus-pound raccoons in the fall. What adventures were experienced during that long, first summer will hopefully make you smile while gaining some insight into the world of this charming animal! As the Bodes found out, ""No cage is big enough for a raccoon,"" and neither is a bathroom! If having raccoons in your bathroom is not on your ""bucket list,"" perhaps you would like to help in other ways. Donating your time, money, usable items (like blankets) or having property where rehabbed animals can be released are some of the things that help us volunteers. Great release sites need: no busy roads, or irate farmers, lots of trees, water and food sources, and people willing to back up feed in cold weather. But please, don't volunteer the use of your bathroom!

This book presents a compact and self-contained introduction to the theory of measure and integration. The introduction into this theory is as necessary (because of its multiple applications) as difficult for the uninitiated. Most measure theory treaties involve a large amount of prerequisites and present crucial theoretical challenges. By taking on another approach, this textbook provides less experienced readers with material that allows an easy access to the definition and main properties of the Lebesgue integral.  The book will be welcomed by upper undergraduate/early graduate students who wish to better understand certain concepts and results of probability theory, statistics, economic equilibrium theory, game theory, etc., where the Lebesgue integral makes its presence felt throughout. The book can also be useful to students in the faculties of mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, life sciences, as an introduction to a more in-depth study of measure theory.

Conservation physiology is a rapidly expanding, multidisciplinary field that utilizes physiological knowledge and tools to understand and solve conservation challenges. This novel text provides the first consolidated overview of its scope, purpose, and applications, with a focus on wildlife. It outlines the major avenues and advances by which conservation physiology is contributing to the monitoring, management, and restoration of wild animal populations. This book also defines opportunities for further growth in the field and identifies critical areas for future investigation. By using a series of global case studies, contributors illustrate how approaches from the conservation physiology toolbox can tackle a diverse range of conservation issues including the monitoring of environmental stress, predicting the impact of climate change, understanding disease dynamics, improving captive breeding, and reducing human-wildlife conflict. Moreover, by acting as practical road maps across a diversity of sub-disciplines, these case studies serve to increase the accessibility of this discipline to new researchers. The diversity of taxa, biological scales, and ecosystems highlighted illustrate the far-reaching nature of the discipline and allow readers to gain an appreciation for the purpose, value, applicability, and status of the field of conservation physiology. Conservation Physiology is an accessible supplementary textbook suitable for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of conservation science, eco-physiology, evolutionary and comparative physiology, natural resources management, ecosystem health, veterinary medicine, animal physiology, and ecology.

The stratified ocean mixes episodically in small patches where energy is dissipated and density smoothed over scales of centimeters. The net effect of these countless events effects the shape of the ocean's thermocline, how heat is transported from the sea surface to the interior, and how dense bottom water is lifted into the global overturning circulation. This book explores the primary factors affecting mixing, beginning with the thermodynamics of seawater, how they vary in the ocean and how they depend on the physical properties of seawater. Turbulence and double diffusion are then discussed, which determines how mixing evolves and the different impacts it has on velocity, temperature, and salinity. It reviews insights from both laboratory studies and numerical modelling, emphasising the assumptions and limitations of these methods. This is an excellent reference for researchers and graduate students working to advance our understanding of mixing, including oceanographers, atmospheric scientists and limnologists.

JavaScript has become the most popular programming language in the world. It has attained that position by being easy to use and powerful in its capabilities. It wasn't always that way but today it can be used to build virtually any application you desire. With the addition of HTML5 and CSS3, it allows for wonderfully animated and powerful web sites and applications without having to use other technologies such as Adobe Flash. JavaScript has also become much more standardized across the multiple browsers in use today. With the recent proliferation of libraries and frameworks that many developers use, the focus has shifted towards these new tools, but they still rely on native JavaScript. And these libraries and frameworks can greatly increase the size of your code as well as slowing down performance. This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization. The goal is to help programmers produce smaller and faster JavaScript applications. Even programmers using frameworks and libraries can benefit from understanding the performance trade-offs they make when using those tools.

This book focuses on the Symmetric Informationally Complete quantum measurements (SICs) in dimensions 2 and 3, along with one set of SICs in dimension 8. These objects stand out in ways that have earned them the moniker of ""sporadic SICs"". By some standards, they are more approachable than the other known SICs, while by others they are simply atypical. The author forays into quantum information theory using them as examples, and the author explores their connections with other exceptional objects like the Leech lattice and integral octonions. The sporadic SICs take readers from the classification of finite simple groups to Bell's theorem and the discovery that ""hidden variables"" cannot explain away quantum uncertainty.While no one department teaches every subject to which the sporadic SICs pertain, the topic is approachable without too much background knowledge. The book includes exercises suitable for an elective at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level.

An accessible guide to cybersecurity for the everyday user, covering cryptography and public key infrastructure, malware, blockchain, and other topics. It seems that everything we touch is connected to the internet, from mobile phones and wearable technology to home appliances and cyber assistants. The more connected our computer systems, the more exposed they are to cyber attacks--attempts to steal data, corrupt software, disrupt operations, and even physically damage hardware and network infrastructures. In this volume of the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, cybersecurity expert Duane Wilson offers an accessible guide to cybersecurity issues for everyday users, describing risks associated with internet use, modern methods of defense against cyber attacks, and general principles for safer internet use.Wilson describes the principles that underlie all cybesecurity defense: confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation (validating the source of information). He explains that confidentiality is accomplished by cryptography; examines the different layers of defense; analyzes cyber risks, threats, and vulnerabilities; and breaks down the cyber kill chain and the many forms of malware. He reviews some online applications of cybersecurity, including end-to-end security protection, secure ecommerce transactions, smart devices with built-in protections, and blockchain technology. Finally, Wilson considers the future of cybersecurity, discussing the continuing evolution of cyber defenses as well as research that may alter the overall threat landscape.

This thesis presents detailed mechanistic studies on a series of important C-H activation reactions using combined computational methods and mass spectrometry experiments. It also provides guidance on the design and improvement of catalysts and ligands. The reactions investigated include: (i) a nitrile-containing template-assisted meta-selective C-H activation, (ii) Pd/mono-N-protected amino acid (MPAA) catalyzed meta-selective C-H activation, (iii) Pd/MPAA catalyzed asymmetric C-H activation reactions, and (iv) Cu-catalyzed sp3 C-H cross-dehydrogenative-coupling reaction. The book reports on a novel dimeric Pd-M (M = Pd or Ag) model for reaction (i), which successfully explains the meta-selectivity observed experimentally. For reaction (ii), with a combined DFT/MS method, the author successfully reveals the roles of MPAA ligands and a new C-H activation mechanism, which accounts for the improved reactivity and high meta-selectivity and opens new avenues for ligand design. She subsequently applies ion-mobility mass spectrometry to capture and separate the [Pd(MPAA)(substrate)] complex at different stages for the first time, providing support for the internal-base model for reaction (iii). Employing DFT studies, she then establishes a chirality relay model that can be widely applied to MPAA-assisted asymmetric C-H activation reactions. Lastly, for reaction (iv) the author conducts detailed computational studies on several plausible pathways for Cu/O2 and Cu/TBHP systems and finds a reliable method for calculating the single electron transfer (SET) process on the basis of benchmark studies.

The scarcity of natural sands, particularly in large urban centers, which has led the construction industry to become interested in the topic. Regarding the technical applicability of recycled fine aggregates, scientific researches have shown the feasibility of their use. However, such researches usually try to fit them to the granulometric curve of conventional aggregates, something complex and still subject of discussion. Under this context, based on the assumption that the particle size fractions of the fine recycled aggregates present different characteristics, and that, therefore, these characteristics would influence differently the properties of mortars and concretes; the work proposes the study of the particle size fractions of two recycled sands, AR1 (sand from a RCD plant) and AR2 (sand from RC of specimens from a concrete plant).The results showed that the AR1 sand and its powdery fraction are able to refine pores of mortars and that there are differences in the physical-mechanical behaviors of recycled mortars as the granulometric fraction is replaced, increasing the possibility of application of fine aggregates in mix designs.

Natural resources are material components of the earth's surface that are used by human beings to sustain their livelihoods. The world's population is growing thus exerting increasing pressure on natural resources.Such a scenario demands and dectates that responsible natural resource management paradigms replace old ones if we are to engender development with equity.We did not 'inherit' the earth from our ancestors, rather we borrowed it from future generations.We should bequeath a good environment to future generations. The earth has enough resources for everyone's needs but not everyone's greed.There must be some re-thinking and harmonisation of the manner in which we utilise natural resources because the earth's resources are finite and yet essential for all life. The book examines how natural resources should be used and managed for sustainable development. Resources are a shared ownership, a collective trusteeship requiring caring beyond individualstewardship.Environmental problems demonstrate that the capacity of natural resources is inelastic and demand planned natural resource use if future generations are to live a better quality life with the same resources.

This collection features three peer-reviewed literature reviews on reducing antibiotic use in dairy production. The first chapter describes the regulatory control of medicines in the United Kingdom and European Union and discusses the wider implications of antimicrobial use in dairy production and the need for change in the way we view and use medicines. The chapter also proposes how medicine prescribing practices in the dairy industry may undergo a series of changes in the near future. The second chapter considers recent advances of disease prevention in dairy cattle. Using bovine respiratory disease as a model, the chapter investigates key interactions between the host, environment and pathogen. These interactions can provide beneficial information that can be utilised to develop a prevention platform for multiple syndromes of bacterial disease in dairy cattle. The final chapter begins by assessing the need to promote digestive efficiency and productivity whilst maintaining animal health and welfare. It considers the role of probiotics in achieving this and reviews the range of research undertaken on the benefits and modes of action of probiotics. The chapter also details the role of probiotics in reducing antibiotic use in dairy production through improvements in areas such as pathogen control, feed efficiency and methane production.

Tectonic plates are constantly moving, either crashing into one another creating a mosaic of mountains and shallow seas, or tearing apart and isolating large swathes of land. In both cases plate tectonics separates populations leading to the evolution of biota. Tectonics is also responsible for the destruction life, for instance when large coral reefs or shallow seas are compressed to form mountain peaks. Could recent research into these processes provide enough evidence to show that tectonics may be the ultimate driver of life on Earth? Our book delves into the current research in tectonics, particularly neotectonics, and its impact on rapid changes on biogeographical classification, also known as bioregionalisation. We also introduce a new term biotectonics that studies the impact of tectonics on biogeoregionalisation. The question we ask is how tectonics directly influences the distribution of biota in four case studies: the Mesozic and early Palaeogene Australides, which spans the Proto-Pacific coast of the South America, Antaractica and Australiasia; and the Neogene of Australia. To conclude we examine the role of neotectonics on tranistion zones and the Amazon Basin and make a case for biotectonic extinction.

This book is devoted to the mathematical foundation of boundary integral equations. The combination of ?nite element analysis on the boundary with these equations has led to very e?cient computational tools, the boundary element methods (see e.g., the authors [139] and Schanz and Steinbach (eds.) [267]). Although we do not deal with the boundary element discretizations in this book, the material presented here gives the mathematical foundation of these methods. In order to avoid over generalization we have con?ned ourselves to the treatment of elliptic boundary value problems. The central idea of eliminating the ?eld equations in the domain and - ducing boundary value problems to equivalent equations only on the bou- ary requires the knowledge of corresponding fundamental solutions, and this idea has a long history dating back to the work of Green [107] and Gauss [95, 96]. Today the resulting boundary integral equations still serve as a major tool for the analysis and construction of solutions to boundary value problems.

Conservation physiology is a rapidly expanding, multidisciplinary field that utilizes physiological knowledge and tools to understand and solve conservation challenges. This novel text provides the first consolidated overview of its scope, purpose, and applications, with a focus on wildlife. It outlines the major avenues and advances by which conservation physiology is contributing to the monitoring, management, and restoration of wild animal populations. This book also defines opportunities for further growth in the field and identifies critical areas for future investigation. By using a series of global case studies, contributors illustrate how approaches from the conservation physiology toolbox can tackle a diverse range of conservation issues including the monitoring of environmental stress, predicting the impact of climate change, understanding disease dynamics, improving captive breeding, and reducing human-wildlife conflict. Moreover, by acting as practical road maps across a diversity of sub-disciplines, these case studies serve to increase the accessibility of this discipline to new researchers. The diversity of taxa, biological scales, and ecosystems highlighted illustrate the far-reaching nature of the discipline and allow readers to gain an appreciation for the purpose, value, applicability, and status of the field of conservation physiology. Conservation Physiology is an accessible supplementary textbook suitable for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners in the fields of conservation science, eco-physiology, evolutionary and comparative physiology, natural resources management, ecosystem health, veterinary medicine, animal physiology, and ecology.

The Special Issue ""Juvenile Onset Huntington's Disease"" highlights the growing interest in understanding the unique aspects of this ultra-rare disorder. After decades of research, gene therapy trials are underway for Adult Onset Huntington's Disease (AOHD). However, patients with Juvenile Onset Huntington's Disease (JOHD) are often excluded from these efforts, leaving many questions regarding its phenomenology. The current issue includes seven articles spanning work on the difficult emotional experiences of parents of children with JOHD; a review of the clinical manifestations of JOHD; behavioral issues in JOHD; CAG repeat and age of motor onset; autonomic nervous system dysfunction; and abnormality in MRI metabolic markers. Finally, a review of the therapeutic advances is included, highlighting future possibilities of clinical trials in JOHD subjects. The HD community-patients, family members at-risk for HD, caregivers, health-care professionals and scientists-is keen on expanding our understanding of JOHD. In the flurry of research on AOHD, those with JOHD were seemingly 'left behind.' The study of patients who are afflicted early in life with HD has become imperative, with this Special Issue representing just the beginning of the required effort to address this urgent need.

This book is an excellent compilation, review, and summary of the fundamentals of mathematics and statistics for prospective teachers, graduate students that are returning to school in technical disciplines, talented high school students planning to go on to college, and for anybody that needs to, wants to, or just enjoys reading about math, statistics, and its many applications. The book is organized into three main parts: Math Fundamentals, Probability Fundamentals, and Statistics Fundamentals. In the math part, there are chapters on logic, set and number theory, algebra and geometry, and the fundamentals of trigonometry and the single variable calculus. In the probability part, there are chapters on combinatorics and probability, random variables, probability distributions and their parameters. In the statistics part, there are chapters on simple random samples and some common statistics, the law of large numbers, many common probability distributions, the normal distribution and its relation to the Central Limit Theorem, the basics of small and large sample statistical inference involving hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation, and an introduction to linear regression and the associated idea of correlation. The reader has been supplied with many exercises, along with the answers in an appendix. These should help to reinforce the basic ideas for the reader as they proceed through the book. It should be noted that there is a significant amount of the book devoted to the single variable calculus, since it is so important for many students of technical subjects. However, the last two parts of the book devoted to probability and statistics are presented in an entirely algebraic way and do not involve calculus. This should not lessen the books usefulness for most readers.

Investigating the complex nature of environmental problems requires the integration of different environmental processes across major components of the environment. Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) not only includes analyzing and modelling environmental changes, but also supports planning alternatives that promote environmental monitoring and management.The adoption of integrated modelling approaches requires the development of frameworks which may be used to investigate individual environmental processes and their interactions with each other. Integrated modelling systems and frameworks are often the only way to examine important environmental processes and interactions, relevant spatial and temporal scales, and feedback mechanisms of complex systems for CEA.This book examines the ways in which interactions and relationships between environmental components are understood, paying special attention to climate, land, water quantity and quality, and both anthropogenic and natural stressors. It reviews modelling approaches for each component and existing integrated modelling systems for CEA. Finally, it proposes an integrated modelling framework and provides perspectives on future research avenues for cumulative effects assessment.

Physics cannot show that a corporal, godlike figure exists in the universe. However, the major religions of the world, especially Christianity, describe God as a spiritual energy and not corporal. Quantum physics says there exists a universal energy that has the attributes of God. This energy has consciousness and creativity. All matter is composed of this energy. This energy was responsible for the Big Bang. Professor emeritus William Tiller, a physicist at Stanford University, has shown this energy can interact with human consciousness. This book takes you through a non-mathematical proof of the physics of these assertions.

Mangroves are highly productive and they serve as a vital source for Organic Carbon in the sediments. The study area, Pichavaram mangrove is located along the southeast coast of India. This mangrove environment is rapidly degrading due to natural and man-made disturbances. In order to understand the temporal and spatial changes in the mangrove forest, Landuse / Landcover change detection was carried out for this area using satellite digital data. Five Core samples were collected from widely varying environments in the study area along with twenty surface sediments and twenty water samples. The Core samples were analyzed for grain size, Organic Carbon, Sulphur, Calcium Carbonate, acid-leachable fractions of Fe and Mn, major oxides and bulk concentration of Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu and Zn. Similar to the Core sediments, the surface sediment samples were analyzed for major oxides and trace elements. The water samples were analyzed for pH, Salinity and Dissolved Oxygen. An Organic Carbon budget was developed based on the depth profile of Organic Carbon. Results of all the above analyses were digitized using GIS and a spatial database was created.

This textbook introduces linear algebra and optimization in the context of machine learning. Examples and exercises are provided throughout the book. A solution manual for the exercises at the end of each chapter is available to teaching instructors. This textbook targets graduate level students and professors in computer science, mathematics and data science. Advanced undergraduate students can also use this textbook. The chapters for this textbook are organized as follows: 1. Linear algebra and its applications: The chapters focus on the basics of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based classification, and outlier detection. The tight integration of linear algebra methods with examples from machine learning differentiates this book from generic volumes on linear algebra. The focus is clearly on the most relevant aspects of linear algebra for machine learning and to teach readers how to apply these concepts.2. Optimization and its applications: Much of machine learning is posed as an optimization problem in which we try to maximize the accuracy of regression and classification models. The ""parent problem"" of optimization-centric machine learning is least-squares regression. Interestingly, this problem arises in both linear algebra and optimization, and is one of the key connecting problems of the two fields. Least-squares regression is also the starting point for support vector machines, logistic regression, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization also require the development of optimization methods. A general view of optimization in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to back propagation in neural networks. A frequent challenge faced by beginners in machine learning is the extensive background required in linear algebra and optimization. One problem is that the existing linear algebra and optimization courses are not specific to machine learning; therefore, one would typically have to complete more course material than is necessary to pick up machine learning. Furthermore, certain types of ideas and tricks from optimization and linear algebra recur more frequently in machine learning than other application-centric settings. Therefore, there is significant value in developing a view of linear algebra and optimization that is better suited to the specific perspective of machine learning.

Investigating the complex nature of environmental problems requires the integration of different environmental processes across major components of the environment. Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) not only includes analyzing and modelling environmental changes, but also supports planning alternatives that promote environmental monitoring and management.The adoption of integrated modelling approaches requires the development of frameworks which may be used to investigate individual environmental processes and their interactions with each other. Integrated modelling systems and frameworks are often the only way to examine important environmental processes and interactions, relevant spatial and temporal scales, and feedback mechanisms of complex systems for CEA.This book examines the ways in which interactions and relationships between environmental components are understood, paying special attention to climate, land, water quantity and quality, and both anthropogenic and natural stressors. It reviews modelling approaches for each component and existing integrated modelling systems for CEA. Finally, it proposes an integrated modelling framework and provides perspectives on future research avenues for cumulative effects assessment.

In 2010, the Handbook of Catchment Management provided a benchmark on how our understanding and actions in water management within a catchment context had evolved in recent decades. Ten years on, the catchment management concept is entering a new phase of development aligned to contemporary and future challenges. These include climate change uncertainty, further understanding in ecological functioning under change, the drive for a low-carbon, energy efficient and circular society, multiple uses of water, the emergence of new pollutants of concern, new approaches to valuation, finance and pricing mechanisms, stewardship and community engagement, the integration of water across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the link between water, energy and food. These developments are framed within an increasingly data rich world where new analytics, sensor technology and processing power are informing increasingly real-time decision making. The challenge is also to increase cross-compliance and policy integration to meet multiple stakeholder objectives, and to link actions to achieve cost-effective outcomes. In addition, there are a number of new and exciting city, region and basin-scale real-world examples of contemporary and new catchment thinking; integrating science, technology, knowledge and governance to address multiple drivers and complex problems from across the globe. The time is now right, one decade on from the original benchmarking text and synthesis, to capture the new challenges facing catchment management and water resources management globally.  This revised and updated edition of the Handbook of Catchment Management features:   Thoroughly rewritten chapters which provide an up-to-date view of catchment management issues and contexts  New case study material highlighting multi-sectoral management in different globally significant basins and different geographical locations  Up-to-date topics selected for their resonance not only in natural sciences and engineering, but also in other fields, such as socio-economics, law and policy   The Handbook is designed for a broad audience, but will be particularly useful for advanced students, researchers, academics and water sector professionals such as planners, consultants and regulators.

San Francisco Bay is a shallow estuary surrounded by a large population center. The forces that built it began with plate tectonics and involved the collision of the Pacific and North American plates and the subduction of the Juan de Fuka plate. Changes in the climate resulting from the last ice age yielded lower and then higher sea levels. Human activity influenced the Bay. Gold mining during the California gold rush sent masses of slit into the Bay. Humans have also built several major cities and filled significant parts of the Bay.

The Complete 3 Books Series on Coding GamesBook 1In this book you'll discover- How to program a vast variety of different game genres.- The most important game design elements crucial to your success.- How to use the Gosu library to make games in Ruby.- The best way to ensure your RPG Maker game is better than the rest.- A crash-course in Unity to kick start your professional careerThis book won't just teach you how to code. Rather, it'll teach you the ins and outs of game design so that you can make a game that's actually fun and entertaining, rather than just a classroom project. Book 2Learning how to code properly sometimes can be very perplexing and needlessly complicated. Or even worse, boring. Instead of actively learning new programs or exciting new applications of your code, you are forced to go through hundreds of boring texts, all filled with confusing texts and hopelessly mysterious symbols. This wasn't what you expected! Surely there must be a better way to learn how to program and make coding more fun! By making the whole experience a game! In this book Coding Games, we will show you what coding is, its fundamental concepts, and how you can master the basic principles of coding through games. Book 3This book's ideology is simple and straight-forward: equip the user with the most important concepts to catapult your game development skills. When looking for a good book that explains game programming, readers are usually bombarded with information from the author without any context. Often, code doesn't make sense, hasn't been explained properly, and the concepts the author tries to explain are unclear. The main reason for this is that authors, when writing technical books such as this, assume that the reader will have the context for every small detail they leave out and every major detail they choose to convey. This book stays true to its purpose and builds upon the content discussed in the previous series. Even though readers coming to the advanced level of game programming should be confident in their intermediate and basic level understanding of the topic, the chapters' content is careful not to leave anything ambiguous to the reader. In this book you will learn- Start up and shut down sequences- Application layers- How to create game objects and characters- How to create game loops- How to program devices and user interfaces- Sounds, animations, and much more!

This book provides a comprehensive overview on the recent trend toward high performance computing architectures especially as it relates to analytics, data mining, and machine learning. Topics that are covered include: big data (and its characteristics), high performance computing for analytics, massively parallel processing (MPP) databases, algorithms for big data, in-memory databases, implementation of machine learning algorithms for big data platforms, and analytics environments. However, none gives a historical and comprehensive view of all these separate topics in a single document. Through the understanding of these topics corporations can create an ideal analytic environment that is better suited to the challenges of today's analytics demands. The book is organized in three parts:   Part 1 is designed to introduce the concepts and vocabulary to educate the reader on the current buzz in the area and the tradeoffs or limitations of certain technology and what factors should influence their choices. Part 2 focus on the techniques and methods that can be used with a corporation's data to turn it into value. Part 3 will be a set of detailed Case Studies.  Updates to this edition include:   Update introduction Add and update sections in Part 1 about cloud computing, virtualized technology (containers), functions as a service (FAAS), and DevOps methodology. Add a section on Deep Learning in Part 2. This section will cover convolutional neural networks (CNN) which are generally used for computer vision applications and recurrent neural networks (RNN) which are used in text applications or other sequences. Update chapter 3 with major enhancements of R and Python including my contributions to integration of open source with SAS.

Gain the essential skills for computer science using one of today's most popular programming languages, Java. This book will prepare you for AP CompSci Complete, but you don't need to be sitting that class to benefit. Computer science has become a basic life skill that everyone is going to need to learn. Whether you are going into a career or side hustle in business, technology, creativity, architecture, or almost any other field, you will find coding and computer science play a role. So when we learn programming we are going to focus on three things: what is the process; what is the syntax; and what is the flow. The process is represented as a flowchart. We will learn how to make these to help you plan out what you are going to do before you write a line of code. At first, the flowcharts will be pretty simple, but then they will get more complex. The syntax is the code: this is what you write that translates the process you create in a flowchart to the instructions that the computer can understand. Finally, there is the flow. This is where you trace through the code and see how the data and information it stores along the way changes. You can see how the operation of the program cascades from line to line. You will be building charts that will capture the programming flow so you can better understand how the computer processes code to make your next program easier to conceive and code.Along the way to aid in the learning of the essential Java skills, there will be three kinds of project types throughout this book: business software projects for applications where you work for a company and need to complete an internal project for a team such as the sales, marketing, or data science teams; social good projects where you are working for non-profits or for agencies that are trying to research and provide solutions to economic, environmental, medical, or humanitarian projects; and game development projects for games based on player input, random chance, or other mechanics for the use of entertainment.What is unique about computer science is how it has become a skill, and not just a career. While there are jobs and titles of ""computer scientist"", the skill of computer science, and specifically programming, are almost everywhere. After reading and using this book, you'll have the essential skills to think like a computer scientist, even if you are not. As a result you'll be of greater value to your clients, your company, and yourself. What You Will Learn Discover the essential elements of Java to learn how to code like a computer scientist Apply those elemental skills to a variety of project types drawn from business, social good, and game development Flow chart your coding and software projects Identify real-world metaphors to help reinforce computer science concepts and theories Who This Book Is For Those who want to learn programming and want to think like a computer scientist.

This book introduces students in archaeology and others interested to the materials that form ancient ceramics. It focuses on the nature of these materials, the minerals, rocks, clays, and ways they have been modified for the production of ceramics. The study of the use of the ceramic materials by potters through the ages allows us a better understanding of the potter's behavior and the influences on his or her craft. The book details clay, mineral and rock formations, basic geology principles, types of analyses conducted to study raw materials, and the different processes involved in making pottery. It describes the different attributes of a ceramic paste, and the different scales one can look at it. This book is conceived as an introduction to the origin of the materials which form ceramics in an archaeological context, their selection and use by potters. It is abundantly illustrated, in color, and with many case studies.

Author's Note Science history shows many theories to have been presented and initially accepted but had later been found wanting or replaced by a more enlightening theory. The earth as the centre of the universe with the sun and other planets revolving around it was widely accepted during the second century A.D. Since then science has progressed in leaps and bounds until today we talk of parallel universes, super-strings and wormholes. We have the ten dimension theory of the universe which makes possible the merger between the geometry of Einstein's theory and that of the quantum field theory. Enormously powerful theorems in mathematics now take on physical significance. Physics and mathematics are so intricately interwoven that mathematics leads us in directions we would not normally take if we followed up physical ideas by themselves. Calculus was born from a need by Newton to solve the equations for gravity. Physics, I believe, is ultimately based on a small set of physical principles. These principles, called first principles, can usually be expressed in plain English without reference to mathematics. From the Copernican theory to Newton's laws of motion, and even Einstein's relativity, the basic physical first principles require just a few sentences that are largely independent of any mathematics. And remarkably, only a handful of first principles are sufficient to summarise most of modern physics. Nevertheless, mathematical equation is still the best way to prove a point. Cosmologist and mathematician Stephen Hawking has written eloquently about the need to explain to the widest possible audience the physical picture underlying all of physics: ""If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientist and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answers to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason; for then we would know the mind of God."" My Seven Circle Theory has a correlation with the creation account stated in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible. The activity that we see in nature all around us was all progressively created in six cyclic periods out of this dark matter or energy medium. Today we live in that sixth cyclic phase. Here all physical matter i.e. protons/atoms are in a progressive decay status which gives us a duration measurement factor called 'Time'. Time only commenced with the start of this sixth phase. The next phase is the seventh cycle phase and total atom decay will have been completed with physical matter non-existent. The seventh cycle phase will be one of total inactivity. The universe will be dormant and devoid of all matter; virtually a period of rest. Perhaps the 'Ancients' really knew how our universe was created, and that with the passing of time their records seem distorted. The overall seven cycles principle however, has perpetuated. Today, Big Bang theorists believe that a mysterious fluid existed at 10-12 seconds from Big Bang and that in the following moments as expansion occurred and temperatures dropped, a sudden phase change occurred in this mysterious fluid reminiscent of water freezing to ice. Suddenly (they believe) all the familiar particles, protons, electrons, neutrinos, photons, quarks, etc. came into existence! 'Faster than Light' is a science theory of invisible Dark Matter and has its relationship with the E in Einstein's formula E = mC簡. As such throughout the text I have referred to Dark Matter as that subtle Energy-Medium from which all mass is created. It is a 'Grand Unified Theory' but without rigorous mathematical treatment.

This book provides a state-of-the-art overview on the dynamics and coevolution in multi-level strategic interaction games. As such it summarizes the results of the European CONGAS project, which developed new mathematical models and tools for the analysis, prediction and control of dynamical processes in systems possessing a rich multi-level structure and a web of interwoven interactions among elements with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The framework is built around game theoretical concepts, in particular evolutionary and multi-resolution games, and includes also techniques drawn from graph theory, statistical mechanics, control and optimization theory. Specific attention is devoted to systems that are prone to intermittency and catastrophic events due to the effect of collective dynamics.

This book highlights the mathematical and physical properties of acoustical sources with singularities located in the complex plane and presents the application of such special elements to solve acoustical radiation and scattering problems.  Sources whose origin lies in the complex plane are also solutions of the wave equation but possess different radiating properties as their counterparts with real positions. Such mathematical constructions are known in the fields of optics and electrodynamics, but they are not common in acoustical research. The objective of the book is to introduce this concept to acousticians and motivate them to engage themselves in further research and application of complex sources. Such sources are particularly useful to formulate Green's functions and related equivalent source and boundary element methods in half-spaces.

Bringing a unique perspective to the burgeoning ethical and legal issues surrounding the presence of artificial intelligence in our daily lives, the book uses theory and practice on animal rights and the rights of nature to assess the status of robots.  Through extensive philosophical and legal analyses, the book explores how rights can be applied to nonhuman entities. This task is completed by developing a framework useful for determining the kinds of personhood for which a nonhuman entity might be eligible, and a critical environmental ethic that extends moral and legal consideration to nonhumans. The framework and ethic are then applied to two hypothetical situations involving real-world technology--animal-like robot companions and humanoid sex robots. Additionally, the book approaches the subject from multiple perspectives, providing a comparative study of legal cases on animal rights and the rights of nature from around the world and insights from structured interviews with leading experts in the field of robotics. Ending with a call to rethink the concept of rights in the Anthropocene, suggestions for further research are made.  An essential read for scholars and students interested in robot, animal and environmental law, as well as those interested in technology more generally, the book is a ground-breaking study of an increasingly relevant topic, as robots become ubiquitous in modern society.

This book studies the Dutch mathematician Simon Stevin (1548-1620) as a new type of 'man of knowledge'. Traditionally, Stevin is best known for his contributions to the 'Archimedean turn'. This innovative volume moves beyond this conventional image by bringing many other aspects of his work into view, by analysing the connections between the multiple strands of his thinking and by situating him in a broader European context. Like other multi-talents ('polymaths') in his time (several of whom are discussed in this volume), Stevin made an important contribution to the transformation of the ideal of knowledge in early modern Europe. This book thus provides new insights into the phenomenon of 'polymaths' in general and in the case of Stevin in particular.

Tropical Deep-Sea Benthos, a continuation of R矇sultats des Campagnes MUSORSTOM, is a series dedicated to the inventory and description of the deep-sea fauna of the world, with special emphasis on the most extensive, yet remote and least explored, region--the Indo-West Pacific. The comprehensive series of marine expeditions undertaken by the French National Museum of Natural History and the Institut de Recherche pour le D矇veloppement (IRD) continue to collect many new, strange, and sometimes colorful crustaceans. The present volume includes for the first time results from recent expeditions off Papua New Guinea.  Papua New Guinea always had a special place in the heart of marine biologists. Firstly, but barely explored during the expedition of the Challenger (1875), deep-sea fauna from Papua New Guinea remained a gap of knowledge until the recent series of expeditions launched by the museum: to Biopapua (2010), Papua Niugini (2012), Madeep (2014) and Kavieng (2014). From these expeditions' amazing samplings of benthic fauna, an international network of naturalists and taxonomists, federated around the Tropical Deep-Sea Benthos program, has described since 2012 more than 258 new species of mollusks, fishes, sea spiders, corals, and crustaceans. This special Papua New Guinea volume comprises descriptions and new occurrences for more than 360 species including cirripeds, crabs, armored shrimps, ghost shrimps, and squat lobsters. Many are illustrated with spectacular color images of freshly caught specimens. With forty-four new species of crustaceans described in this volume, more than three hundred new marine species will have been discovered around Papua New Guinea and its satellite islands.

This enthusiastic, witty, and informative introduction to the world of insects and why we could not survive without them is ""a joy"" (The Times, London) and ""charming...Highlighting them in all their buzzing, stinging, biting glory"" (The New York Times Book Review).  Insects comprise roughly half of the animal kingdom. They live everywhere--deep inside caves, 18,000 feet high in the Himalayas, inside computers, in Yellowstone's hot springs, and in the ears and nostrils of much larger creatures. There are insects that have ears on their knees, eyes on their penises, and tongues under their feet. Most of us think life would be better without bugs. In fact, life would be impossible without them. Most of us know that we would not have honey without honeybees, but without the pinhead-sized chocolate midge, cocoa flowers would not pollinate. No cocoa, no chocolate. The ink that was used to write the Declaration of Independence was derived from galls on oak trees, which are induced by a small wasp. The fruit fly was essential to medical and biological research experiments that resulted in six Nobel prizes. Blowfly larva can clean difficult wounds; flour beetle larva can digest plastic; several species of insects have been essential to the development of antibiotics. Insects turn dead plants and animals into soil. They pollinate flowers, including crops that we depend on. They provide food for other animals, such as birds and bats. They control organisms that are harmful to humans. Life as we know it depends on these small creatures. ""Delivering a hail of facts with brio and precision"" (Nature) Anne Sverdrup-Thygeson shows us that there is more variety among insects than we thought possible and the more you learn about insects, the more fascinating they become. Extraordinary Insects is ""a very enthusiastic look at the flying, crawling, stinging bug universe world, and why we should cherish it"" (The Philadelphia Inquirer). **Note: This book was previously published under the title Buzz, Sting, Bite.

~~~《名家名著》03  V.S. 《無瑕的程式碼》03~~~


	小記者︰能說說你對《無瑕的程式碼──敏捷完整版》的讀後心得嗎？
	工程師︰自從讀了這本《敏捷完整版》之後，我再也不怕面對那些慣老闆、慣客戶了。而且客戶滿意度、專案完成度都一百分呢！

	這本書是《無瑕的程式碼》系列書的第三冊，也是《名家名著》系列書的第三冊。主題是「敏捷開發」，而重點仍舊是回歸到「如何撰寫出好的程式碼」。

	什麼是「敏捷開發（Agile Development）」呢？簡單來說，它是軟體開發的一套方法，特點是只要透過這套方法，就能使你的專案更敏捷。

	我們為何非得要讓專案變得敏捷呢？原因無他，就是因為我們有慣老闆、還有慣客戶。也就是說，對於現今的市場環境而言，專案不夠敏捷是不行的。這一點，相信所有的軟體工程師都無法否認吧！

	可是你可能會反駁說，各行各業都有慣老闆和慣客戶啊（至少在台灣是這樣），為什麼軟體業就要一套特別的方式來應付他們呢？這就是要回歸到一個最根本的問題，「什麼是軟體？」，或者更精確地說「什麼是軟體設計？」，而這個問題和所有的軟體工程師（或程式設計師）習習相關，因為這是工作的本質。

	各式各樣的工程有著所謂的程序，例如橋樑工程師會先進行結構分析，他們會建立電腦模型並進行模擬，接著他們會建立比例模型，並在風洞中或用其他一些方法進行測試。當這些程序都完成了，才會將設計圖交給橋樑的建造工人去建造出真實的橋樑。

	以上是橋樑工程的開發程序，那麼軟體開發的程序呢？在很久很久以前（真的是很久很久以前了），軟體開發也發展出了所謂的程序，也就是瀑布型開發程序。在瀑布型開發中，系統分析師會依照需求與規畫，畫出所謂軟體的設計圖（例如UML圖），然後由「程序員」根據這些圖去寫出程式碼，最後建置（build）成可使用的軟體。

	依照瀑布型開發程序開發出來的軟體，客戶只能選擇要用，還是不要用。不要用的話，是否有其他選擇？如果沒有，那麼客戶即便不滿意，也就只能將就著用（只是邊用邊罵而已）。當然，這是指套裝軟體的開發而言。

	用一個例子來做比方，數十年前，台灣只有國道一號的日子，一位民眾想要開車從彰化到新竹，就只能有一個選擇，即便他不滿意苗栗那段高爬坡會折損車輛壽命，他也別無選擇。但當國道三號建造完畢後，他就有了第二個選擇，因此他會選擇他喜歡的國道來行使。建造國道的總經費是昂貴的（無論是時間還是金錢），但最貴的部分是在於建造部分，而非設計部份。所以國道並不多。競爭者很少。但這種商業模式在軟體業是行不通的。

	若用早期的瀑布型開發程序來對比於國道建設，真正的建造部分，其實就是軟體建置（build）的部分，這部分只要一台電腦，一個編譯器，一個連結器，還有一點點的時間就完成了。所以代價是極低的。或許有人會說，不對，建造的部分應該也要包含按照UML圖去Coding的人工與時間成本。所以這部分的代價應該也是昂貴的。

	這種說法表面上看似合理，但有多少程式碼是完全依照UML圖編寫的呢？在撰寫程式碼的過程中是否會修改原有的UML設計呢？早期這類情況並不嚴重，但晚期因為客戶的挑剔，這種情況早就屢見不鮮，甚至任何軟體工程師在開發專案時，心中早有預期會出現需求發生變化的情況。

	國道的建造工人是無權修改設計圖的，他只能「按圖施工」。而程序員卻去修改了設計圖，這將使得設計圖無法作為最終產品的設計文件。因此，在這種情況下，最終產品的設計文件其實只有一份是準確的，這份文件就是「程式碼」。同時，在這種情況下，程序員應該已經不再只是「程序員」或「碼農」了，因為他參與了設計，換句話說，他應該稱之為程式「設計師」或軟體「工程師」。（在敏捷開發中，並不只有那些繪製UML圖的才叫做設計人員，正確地說，繪製UML圖的人常常也是負責寫程式的人）。

	好的，如果你已經承認「寫程式」也算是「設計」的一環，那麼軟體建置（build）的成本（也就是軟體的建造成本，而非設計成本），應該是無庸置疑的低廉了。這也就是為什麼，客戶說，那邊改成XXX顏色，可以嗎？你會很乾脆地回答，當然沒問題，然後五分鐘內就給客戶看改完之後的結果。想一想，如果要改的是一整段國道護欄的顏色，相信沒有客戶敢做這樣要求，因為他們能預期到，這會花很多很多的錢。

	所以說，建造軟體的花費是很少的，大多數的錢都是花費在「設計」上的。但對於其他工程就不一樣了，設計花費的錢相對於建造花費的錢來說，低廉了許多。

	也就是軟體的這種特殊性，導致了客戶（更有可能的是上司）常常想要東改改、西改改，需求常常在變化。在現今這個快速變化的世界裡，慣客戶與慣老闆們為了競爭優勢（他們心中的競爭優勢），提出需求的變化根本是家常便飯。

	在確定了「需求會變化」、甚至是「會頻繁地變化」這個軟體工程師一定得面對的事實後，軟體工程師該怎麼辦呢？有一群大師級的軟體工程師，開始發明了一系列因應的對策，包含設計模式、極限程式設計、測試驅動開發等等的技藝，還總結了一些物件導向的設計原則。這些都有助於應付變化。最終，這些人集合起來成立了一個「敏捷聯盟」，取名為敏捷（Agile），意思是軟體開發者及軟體本身應該如何敏捷地應付需求的變化，當中牽涉到的範圍極廣，從成員的組織到程式碼的組織都必須敏捷起來，這是門現代軟體設計的顯學，國外大廠早已採用多年。

	Robert C. Martin（Bob大叔）是敏捷聯盟的創始成員之一，也是當中付諸行動並且有所成效的成員之一。他擁有極具說服力的文筆與口才。在這些年中，不斷出書、演講、作為顧問實際前往開發現場指導，並自創「Clean」一詞，其著作還曾獲得Jolt大獎，《Clean Code》一書也成為Amazon該類別最暢銷的著作，這些都對於敏捷開發的推廣有著極重要的貢獻。

	根據《Clean Code》內文的說法，《Clean Code》可說是本書的前傳，而本書是完整說明如何實踐敏捷的書籍。如果您也喜歡Bob大叔的著作，如果你也是Clean派的弟子，或者你想實際體驗敏捷開發，那麼你一定不能錯過這本書。

	本書的寫作風格是循序漸進，由淺入深的，作者會先提出一個問題，然後分析問題，接著實作它，然後是檢討它，展現出初次實作時的錯誤與失策，接著就展示如何透過作者所主張的技術來解決這些問題。這是一本非常講究實務的實踐書籍。此外，本書主要使用的是C#程式碼，這是由Bob大叔的兒子Micah Martin根據C#與.NET平台的特性重新改寫Jolt得獎著作而來的，改寫幅度包含所有的程式碼與內文，並採用了更容易理解的案例來詳述敏捷開發。如果你平常使用的是其他語言，也不必在意，因為傳播的介質不重要，傳授的內容才是本書的價值所在。

	對於一些技術細節，本書果真是大師級的作品，原創性極高，在UML章節中，Bob大叔示範了他如何使用UML（果真和一般人不太一樣），還示範了如何使用UML才能幫助你而非是製造混亂的來源。對於設計模式而言，除了GoF的知名設計模式之外，Bob大叔還在本書中提到幾個他自己常用的設計模式，有些可以視為GoF 23個設計模式的變形，有些則不是，但重點是這些模式都非常好用，可以應用在不同的應用場合，同時Bob大叔也釐清了，某些模式為何不該在哪些場合中使用，他是以效益來看待這件事的，而這也是本書的最大特色：務實。

This book presents both the conventional and less common uses of linear regression in today's cutting-edge scientific research. The authors blend both theory and application to equip readers with an understanding of the basic principles needed to apply regression model-building techniques in various fields of study, including engineering, management, and the health sciences. The authors focused on four areas of improvement for this new edition: new exercises and data sets, new material on generalized regression techniques, the inclusion of JMP software in key places, and finally, the authors focused on carefully condensing the text where possible. This book begins with an introduction of regression and model building. This is followed by chapters on simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, model adequacy checking, transformations and weighting to correct model inadequacies, and diagnostics for leverage and influence. The book also covers polynomial and nonparametric regression models, indicator variables, and multicollinearity.

Explores how two coastal ecosystems are responding to the pressures of human expansion The Northern Adriatic Sea, a continental shelf ecosystem in the Northeast Mediterranean Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay, a major estuary of the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, are semi-enclosed, river-dominated ecosystems with urbanized watersheds that support extensive industrial agriculture.  Coastal Ecosystems in Transition: A Comparative Analysis of the Northern Adriatic and Chesapeake Bay presents an update of a study published two decades ago. Revisiting these two ecosystems provides an opportunity to assess changing anthropogenic pressures in the context of global climate change. The new insights can be used to inform ecosystem-based approaches to sustainable development of coastal environments. Volume highlights include:   Effects of nutrient enrichment and climate-driven changes on critical coastal habitats Patterns of stratification and circulation Food web dynamics from phytoplankton to fish Nutrient cycling, water quality, and harmful algal events Causes and consequences of interannual variability   The American Geophysical Union promotes discovery in Earth and space science for the benefit of humanity.

The Atlantic Forest is one of the 25 hotspots for biodiversity conservation worldwide. It is a unique, large biome (more than 3000 km in latitude; 2500 in longitude), marked by high biodiversity, high degree of endemic species and, at the same time, extremely threatened. Approximately 70% of the Brazilian population lives in the area of this biome, which makes the conflict between biodiversity conservation and the sustainability of the human population a relevant issue. This book aims to cover: 1) the historical characterization and geographic variation of the biome; 2) the distribution of the diversity of some relevant taxa; 3) the main threats to biodiversity, and 4) possible opportunities to ensure the biodiversity conservation, and the economic and social sustainability. Also, it is hoped that this book can be useful for those involved in the development of public policies aimed at the conservation of this important global biome.

Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Informatik - Internet, neue Technologien, Note: 1,2, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Ziel der Seminararbeit ist es, wesentliche Chancen und Risiken des Cloud Computings zu untersuchen und daraufhin festzustellen, ob es sich f羹r die Nutzung innerhalb eines Unternehmen eignet. Mittlerweile sind Informationstechnologien aus dem Alltag nicht mehr wegzudenken, da Bestellungen beispielsweise 羹ber Amazon get瓣tigt und Finanztransaktionen online durchgef羹hrt werden. Diese Aktivit瓣ten bringen einen wachsenden Bedarf an Datenverarbeitungs- und Speichersystemen, der teilweise durch die eigene Rechenleistung im Unternehmen oder im privaten Umfeld nicht abgedeckt werden kann. Der in den 90er-Jahren erstmals von Ramnath Chellappa (Chellappa, 1997) genutzte Begriff des Cloud Computing kann einen L繹sungsansatz darstellen, um den stetig wachsenden Bedarf an IT-Ressourcen zu decken. Durch das Cloud Computing werden dem Anwender scheinbar unendliche Ressourcen zur Verf羹gung gestellt, die auf den eigenen Bedarf angepasst und flexibel genutzt werden kann. Somit liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass das Cloud Computing dazu beitr瓣gt, die zuk羹nftigen Herausforderungen zu bew瓣ltigen. Jedoch stellt sich die Frage, welche Potentiale das Cloud Computing tats瓣chlich erf羹llen kann, welche Herausforderungen den Anwender erwarten und wie diese zu bew瓣ltigen sind.

A data-driven exploration of how children's language learning varies across different languages, providing both a theoretical framework and reference. The Wordbank Project examines variability and consistency in children's language learning across different languages and cultures, drawing on Wordbank, an open database with data from more than 75,000 children and twenty-nine languages or dialects. This big data approach makes the book the most comprehensive cross-linguistic analysis to date of early language learning. Moreover, its data-driven picture of which aspects of language learning are consistent across languages suggests constraints on the nature of children's language learning mechanisms. The book provides both a theoretical framework for scholars of language learning, language, and human cognition, and a resource for future research.

The New York Times bestselling author of Darwin's Doubt and Intelligent Design scholar presents groundbreaking scientific evidence of the existence of God, based on breakthroughs in physics, cosmology, and biology. In 2004, Stephen C. Meyer, one of the preeminent scientists studying the origins of life, ignited a firestorm of media and scientific controversy when a biology journal at the Smithsonian Institution published his peer-reviewed article advancing the theory of Intelligent Design. Then, in his two bestselling books, Signature in the Cell and Darwin's Doubt, he helped unravel a mystery that Charles Darwin did not address: how did life begin? and offered further scientific proof to bolster his arguments on the history of life and our origins, concluding that life was designed.In those previous books, Meyer purposely refrained from attempting to answer questions about ""who"" might have designed life. Now, in The Return of the God Hypothesis, he brings his ideas full circle, providing a reasoned and evidence-based answer to the ultimate mystery of the universe, drawn from recent scientific discoveries in physics, cosmology, and biology. Meyer uses three scientific points to refute popular arguments put forward by the ""New Atheists"" against the existence of God: The evidence from cosmology showing that the material universe had a beginning.The evidence from physics showing that, from the beginning, the universe was been ""finely tuned"" to allow for the possibility of life.The evidence from biology showing that since the universe came into being, large amounts of genetic information present in DNA must have arisen to make life possible.In analyzing the evidence from these three fields, Meyer reveals how the data support not just the existence of an intelligent designer of some kind--but the existence of a theistic creator.

London is more than just a city of ten million people--it is also home to an extraordinary diversity of beautiful wildlife. With world population on the rise and countryside disappearing to urban sprawl and commercial agriculture, the sharing of urban space with nature is more important now than ever. To strike the right balance, we have to preserve and increase the green and blue spaces in our cities and see and love the wildlife that we already have.  One of the greenest capital cities in the world, in 2019 London was declared the world's first National Park City. In Wild Neighbours, documentary and wildlife photographer Sarah Cheesbrough sets out to observe and create photographic portraits of the creatures of her home city of London. Compiled over the course of hundreds of hours, Cheesbrough presents eighty species in intimate and captivating portraits that span all four seasons. In capturing the wildlife of her city, she gives us insight into London's natural world and inspires its conservation through love.

This book qualitatively and quantitatively examines the relationships between the constructed environment, health and social vulnerability. It demonstrates that spatial disintegration is often intertwined with health and social inequalities, and therefore a multidisciplinary approach to urban health is essential in order to analyze the impact that psycho-social-environmental factors can have on objective, and perceived health and to investigate the inequalities in healthcare and medical assistance processes. Empirical relationships have been observed between urban environment, social vulnerability and health in different contexts, however there is still a lack of standardized tools that allow us to gain a clear understanding of how health inequalities and daily life are generated. In order to address this issue, a national network of active research groups has been created to draft and develop a prototypical analysis infrastructure to facilitate empirical studies aimed at shedding light on the complex relationships between health disparities, socio-environmental and economic distress, as well as personal and collective health.  Given the interest in achieving meaningful, fair and lasting solutions to health inequalities, and the current lack of an analytical system, there is the need for new multidisciplinary approaches oriented toward the quality of life within a eco-social model of health. Providing an overview of the methodological approaches discussed, this book will appeal to researchers. At the same time it allows those working in local and government social care, healthcare and administrative institutions to gain insights into best practices in urban contexts.

The Zamolodchikov c-theorem has led to important new insights in the understanding of the Renormalisation Group (RG) and the geometry of the space of QFTs. The present primer introduces and reviews the parallel developments of the search for a higher-dimensional generalisation of the c-theorem and of the Local RG (LRG).The idea of renormalisation with position-dependent couplings, running under local Weyl scaling, is traced from its early realisations to the elegant modern formalism of the LRG. The key r繫le of the associated Weyl consistency conditions in establishing RG flow equations for the coefficients of the trace anomaly in curved spacetime, and their relation to the c-theorem and four-dimensional a-theorem, is explained in detail.A number of different derivations of the c-theorem in two dimensions are presented and subsequently generalised to four dimensions. The obstructions to establishing monotonic C-functions related to the trace anomaly coefficients in four dimensions are explained. The possibility of deriving an a-theorem for the coefficient of the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet density is explored, initially by formulating the QFT on maximally symmetric spaces. Then the formulation of the weak a-theorem using a dispersion relation for four-point functions is presented. Finally, the application of the LRG to the issue of limit cycles in theories with a global symmetry is described, shedding new light on the geometry of the space of couplings in QFT.

This model enables a mobile system to move in a targeted way and interact with its surroundings. It is shown how the developed methods also provide a solid basis for technical assistive aids for visually impaired people.

For 70 years, people have turned to one book to learn about Northwest trees: Trees to Know in Oregon. This new edition, retitled Trees to Know in Oregon and Washington, expands its scope to cover more territory and include more trees.  The book was first published in 1950. Charles R. Ross, an Oregon State University Extension forester, wanted to introduce readers to the towering giants in their backyards. Since then, Edward C. Jensen has stewarded the publication through several more editions. This edition features several rare species native to southwest Oregon. It also updates scientific names and adds a new section on how Northwest forests are likely to be affected by changing climates.  Since its initial publication, Trees to Know has become a mainstay for students, gardeners, small woodland owners and visitors to the Pacific Northwest. Along with all the details on native conifers, broadleaves, and more than 50 ornamental trees, readers will find: More than 400 full-color photos and 70 maps depicting habitat, range and forest type.Easy-to-follow identification keys.Handy guides to help distinguish one variety from another.The story of Northwest forests -- past, present and future.

Rate-transient analysis (RTA) is now one of the most important methods for reservoir and hydraulic fracture characterization used in the petroleum industry for unconventional gas and light oil reservoirs. RTA is also used as the basis for generating a production forecast. However, RTA is based primarily on analytical models that were developed for conventional reservoirs with many simplifying assumptions that often don't apply to unconventional reservoirs. Unconventional Gas and Light Oil Reservoir Rate-Transient Analysis delivers a critical knowledge gap to help practicing reservoir and production engineers understand the unique differences in rate-transient analysis for today's unconventional reservoirs. Starting with the fundamentals, engineers first understand the basic flow regimes and analysis methods along with the unique reservoir properties of unconventional assets. Then, the chapters progress to more advanced topics such as how to modify and apply RTA methods for each instance of shale oil/gas, coalbed methane, and tight shale oil/gas along with transforming these modified methods into higher quality production forecasting, with emphasis on analytical and semi-analytical methods. Supported by many real-world field examples covering both hydraulic fracturing and unconventional reservoirs to learn from with questions and answers to practice, Unconventional Gas and Light Oil Reservoir Rate-Transient Analysis supplies today's petroleum engineers with a more intelligent approach to today's more complex reservoirs.

Boundary value problems on bounded or unbounded intervals, involving two or more coupled systems of nonlinear differential and integral equations with full nonlinearities, are scarce in the literature. The present work by the authors desires to fill this gap.The systems covered here include differential and integral equations of Hammerstein-type with boundary constraints, on bounded or unbounded intervals. These are presented in several forms and conditions (three points, mixed, with functional dependence, homoclinic and heteroclinic, amongst others). This would be the first time that differential and integral coupled systems are studied systematically.The existence, and in some cases, the localization of the solutions are carried out in Banach space, following several types of arguments and approaches such as Schauder's fixed-point theorem or Guo-Krasnosel'ski? fixed-point theorem in cones, allied to Green's function or its estimates, lower and upper solutions, convenient truncatures, the Nagumo condition presented in different forms, the concept of equiconvergence, Carath矇odory functions, and sequences. Moreover, the final part in the volume features some techniques on how to relate differential coupled systems to integral ones, which require less regularity. Parallel to the theoretical explanation of this work, there is a range of practical examples and applications involving real phenomena, focusing on physics, mechanics, biology, forestry, and dynamical systems, which researchers and students will find useful.

Metal Matrix Composites are engineered materials with a combination of two or more dissimilar materials to obtain enhanced properties. The widespread acceptance of particulate metal matrix composites (MMC) for engineering application has been hindered by the high cost of producing components. Advanced composite materials like metal matrix composite is gradually becoming very important materials in manufacturing industries e.g. aerospace, automotive and automobile industries due to their superior properties such as light weight, low density, high strength and absorb vibrations. In today's life high performance on low cost product is required and well needed. In this present investigation Al (6061) alloy has been used as a matrix material and agro waste rice husk ash (RHA) as an reinforcement to form a composite by using two step stir casting process. RHA has been used because it is the only agro waste which contains the maximum amount of silica. Since RHA is obtained as a byproduct solid waste during milling of rice it is completely free of cost and available in abundance. To assess the performance of the composites the mechanical properties, microstructural analysis were used.

Present manuscript is an embodiment of original investigations on the efficacy of fertilizer factory effluent on seed germination, plant growth, and root-knot disease development in tomato plants. The chief motive of undertaking these studies is to explore the utility of fertilizer factory liquid wastes in the seed germination and management of root-knot disease in tomato plants. It has been observed earlier that the fertilizer factory effluent (FFE) successfully control root- knot disease development in certain crops. For physiological investigations, five cultivars were studied. It was done mainly to find out the exact concentration of FFE, having fruitful correlation with the seed germination and growth of plants and negative effect on root- knot disease development. Various concentrations (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100%) were studied for their efficacy on seed germination, plant growth and productivity of root- knot disease in tomato plants. In all the tomato cultivars, three replicates have been employed to study the biological and root-knot parameters.

Artificial neural networks are computational models inspired by neurobiology for enhancing and testing computational analogues of neurons. In a feedforward neural network (FFNN), data processing occurs in only one forward interconnection from the input layer to the output layer without any backward loop. Unsupervised FFNN (UFFNN) clustering has great capabilities such as inherent distributed parallel processing architectures, adjusting the interconnection weights to learn and divide data into meaningful groups with special goals, classifying related data into similar groups without using any class label, controlling noisy data and learning the types of input data values based on their weights and properties. Generally in real environments, dynamic data is high volume and dimensional, therefore, the online dynamic UFFNN clustering methods should be developed to have online incremental learning capability.

The method of compensated compactness as a technique for studying hyperbolic conservation laws is of fundamental importance in many branches of applied mathematics. Until now, however, most accounts of this method have been confined to research papers. Offering the first comprehensive treatment, Hyperbolic Conservation Laws and the Compensated Compactness Method gathers together into a single volume the essential ideas and developments. The authors begin with the fundamental theorems, then consider the Cauchy problem of the scalar equation, build a framework for L8 estimates of viscosity solutions, and introduce the Invariant Region Theory. The study then turns to methods for symmetric systems of two equations and two equations with quadratic flux, and the extension of these methods to the Le Roux system. After examining the system of polytropic gas dynamics (g-law), the authors first study two special systems of one-dimensional Euler equations, then consider the general Euler equations for one-dimensional compressible fluid flow, and extend that method to systems of elasticity in L8 space. Weak solutions for the elasticity system are introduced and an application to adiabatic gas flow through porous media is considered. The final four chapters explore applications of the compensated compactness method to the relaxation problem. With its careful account of the underlying ideas, development of applications in key areas, an inclusion of the author's own contributions to the field, this monograph will prove a welcome addition to the literature and to your library.

Climate change and climate variability creates both risks and opportunities worldwide. By understanding, planning for and adapting to a changing climate, individuals and societies can take advantage of these opportunities and reduce risks where possible. The consequences of climate variability and climate change are potentially more significant for activities that depend on local weather and climatic conditions. This book examines how farmers' perceptions of weather conditions have corresponded with the climatic data recorded at various meteorological stations in the Garden Route, South Africa. Through the use of in-depth interviews, the book analyses farmers' adaptive responses and perceptions of climate change: Are farmers' perceptions and adaptation measures in line with climate data records, as well as with the predicted Southern Cape climate changes? Furthermore, the book incorporates three normative ethical approaches (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics) to explore the ethical challenges these farmers experience.

The quantal superpositions collapse or undergo decoherance due to the observation of universal protoconsciousness field. The universal protoconsciousness field can be considered as gravity and antigravity. The universal protoconsciousness field permeates the whole galaxy and is intrinsic to all matter. Matter is a creation of consciousness. Extraterrestrial intelligence can exist as a superorganism controlling and creating the universe as exemplified by a network of extraterrestrial porphyrions.

In the present scenario, renewable energy sources contribute to global climate change. The main reason for this can be that all the countries start manufacturing power using renewable sources which is almost free from CO2 emission. But some amount of carbon is emitting in the manufacturing, construction, maintenance, and decommissioning stages. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool used to quantify the environmental impact of a particular system or product throughout its entire life span, usually from raw material extraction to final disposal. Life cycle assessment has been done for some renewable energy projects in India. For this project's carbon intensity, Energy intensity has been calculated and compared with the conventional method. Wind and Solar PV power plants are compared with the coal-based conventional power production system, solar street light is compared with a conventional streetlight, and the solar water heater is compared with the electric water heater. Based on that, the Carbon Pay Back Period (CPBP) and Energy Pay Back Period (EPBP) have been calculated.

A logo on products ranging from chopsticks and toilet paper to cell phones and automobiles, the panda is one of the most ubiquitous images in China and throughout the world. Yet the panda holds little notable historical significance in China. Although it has existed in the territory of present-day China since the Pliocene epoch, its widespread popularity there is not only recent, but almost sudden. In Panda Nation, E. Elena Songster links the emergence of the giant panda as a national symbol to the development of nature protection in the People's Republic of China. The panda's transformation into a national treasure exemplifies China's efforts in the mid-twentieth century to distinguish itself as a nation through government-directed science and popular nationalism. The story of the panda's iconic rise offers a striking reflection of China's recent and dramatic ascent as a nation in global status.

The science is clear: by the mid-20th century human beings must stop burning coal, oil and natural gas. Reducing carbon emissions is not enough--they must be eliminated. Each individual ""doing their part"" is only a start. We heat our homes, light our rooms, power our cars, prepare our food, and produce and distribute consumer goods with the help of fossil fuels. A practical and visionary re-imagining of the future is needed. Calling for a technical and spiritual ground-shift, this book proposes carbon boycotts as collective action, with groups and communities changing what products they consume and seeking new ways to work, live and play to steer aggregate demand towards solar, wind, geothermal and renewable energy alternatives.

The model can be readily separated into its component models: the substitution model, the clock model and the tree model. We provide an overview of the most widely used models for each component and highlight the advantages of implementing the tripartite model within a Bayesian framework.

A vivid, eye-opening view of why birds behave the way they do Birds are intelligent, sociable creatures that exhibit a wide array of behaviors--from mobbing and mimicking to mating and joint nesting. Why do they behave as they do? Bringing to light the remarkable actions of birds through examples from species around the world, Understanding Bird Behavior presents engaging vignettes about the private lives of birds, all explained in an evolutionary context.We discover how birds find food, relying on foraging techniques, tools, and thievery. We learn about the courtship rituals through which birds choose, compete for, woo, and win mates; the familial conflicts that crop up among parents, offspring, and siblings; and the stresses and strains of nesting, including territory defense, nepotism, and relationship sabotage. We see how birds respond to threats and danger--through such unique practices as murmurations, specific alarm calls, distraction displays, and antipredator nest design. We also read about how birds change certain behaviors--preening, migration, breeding, and huddling--based on climate. Richly illustrated, this book explores the increasing focus on how individual birds differ in personality and how big data and citizen scientists are helping to add to what we know about them.Drawing on classic examples and the latest research, Understanding Bird Behavior offers a close-up look at the many ways birds conduct themselves in the wild.Compelling insights into bird behaviorClassic examples and the latest research, including work by citizen scientistsFascinating vignettes about the private lives of birds, from finding food and family life, to coping with climate and other threats150 detailed color illustrations and photographs

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition process renowned for its ability to produce layers with unrivaled control of thickness and composition, conformability to extreme three-dimensional structures, and versatility in the materials it can produce. These range from multi-component compounds to elemental metals and structures with compositions that can be adjusted over the thickness of the film. It has expanded from a small-scale batch process to large scale production, also including continuous processing - known as spatial ALD. It has matured into an industrial technology essential for many areas of materials science and engineering from microelectronics to corrosion protection. Its attributes make it a key technology in studying new materials and structures over an enormous range of applications. This Special Issue contains six research articles and one review article that illustrate the breadth of these applications from energy storage in batteries or supercapacitors to catalysis via x-ray, UV, and visible optics.

A Dictionary of Civil and Environmental Engineering is the first ever dictionary written exclusively for all five (5) Disciplines of the Civil and Environmental PE examinations. Created by expert Hydraulic Engineer and Water Resources/Environmental Engineering PE review course instructor Dr. Harry C. Friebel, this comprehensive dictionary guides you through the journey of studying for the PE examination - no more wondering or guessing what a particular term means. During the examination, this dictionary will supplement your understanding of the questions being asked (especially those qualitative questions) providing the necessary edge of getting additional problems correct, increasing your chances of passing the examination and maximizing your potential as a professional engineer.Think you don't need a dictionary, think again!This dictionary was written with the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) Civil and Environmental examinations in mind. Typically, a PE examinee spends well over a thousand dollars on review books, courses and sample examinations. Many previous examinees believe they did not pass the examination the first time due to missing a single problem or two. What if one of those questions could have been answered correctly with a dictionary? Do you really want to chance not understanding what a word means in any of your examination questions? What is it worth to increase your chances of getting additional problems correct?Think of this dictionary as insurance! Hopefully you won't need it, but what if you do? Be wary of anyone stating a dictionary is not necessary for the exam. If you don't think the good people of National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) that put the examination together are not aware of the exact terms defined (and NOT defined) in your review manual glossary, you're kidding yourself. I have received testimonial after testimonial from former students thanking me for recommending that they bring a dictionary to the exam. Don't believe me? Go on Amazon and read the reviews for yourself. Terms can (and do) appear on the examination that you may not be familiar with. What if they are not defined in your reference books, then what? Everyone's vocabulary is different and what's familiar to you, may not be familiar to the person sitting next to you and vice versa. This dictionary may very well be the difference in you passing your examination. I wrote this dictionary with only one objective, to help you pass the PE Civil examination!

A field scientist and conservationist tracks the elusive Blakiston's Fish Owl in the forbidding reaches of eastern Russia When he was just a fledgling birdwatcher, Jonathan C. Slaght had a chance encounter with one of the most mysterious birds on Earth. Bigger than any owl he knew, it looked like a small bear with decorative feathers. He snapped a quick photo and shared it with experts. Soon he was on a five-year journey, searching for this enormous, enigmatic creature in the lush, remote forests of eastern Russia. That first sighting set his calling as a scientist. Despite a wingspan of six feet and a height of over two feet, the Blakiston's fish owl is highly elusive. They are easiest to find in winter, when their tracks mark the snowy banks of the rivers where they feed. They are also endangered. And so, as Slaght and his devoted team set out to locate the owls, they aim to craft a conservation plan that helps ensure the species' survival. This quest sends them on all-night monitoring missions in freezing tents, mad dashes across thawing rivers, and free-climbs up rotting trees to check nests for precious eggs. At the heart of Slaght's story are the fish owls themselves: cunning hunters, devoted parents, singers of eerie duets, and survivors in a harsh and shrinking habitat.

The information security industry is undergoing a major change, forced by the rise of end-to-end encryption, encryption that cannot be intercepted, transport protocol stack evolution, ""zero trust networks"", and distributed computing. While we understand the logical connections between these trends, there is little analysis of all of these trends in combination. Examination of all five trends uncovers opportunities that not only improve the state of information security and the general posture, but also lead to resource reductions necessary for information security to be sustainable.  In this exciting new book from security expert Kathleen M. Moriarty, the examination of all five trends uncovers opportunities to change the state of information security. Providing a unique perspective from the center of the debates on end-to-end encryption, Moriarty explores emerging trends in both information security and transport protocol evolution, going beyond simply pointing out today's problems to providing solutions for the future of our product space.

Aging is an inevitable part of life, and is becoming a worldwide social, economic and health problem due to the fact that an increasing proportion of individuals in the advanced age category have a higher probability of developing age-related disorders. New therapeutic approaches are still in need to decrease or slow the effects of such diseases in this aging society. Advances in 'omic technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have significantly advanced our understanding of diseases in multiple medical areas. It is hoped that emerging hits from these analyses might be prioritized for further screening as potential novel drug targets for increasing the human healthspan in line with the lifespan, which will in turn lead to new therapeutic strategies and drug development projects by the pharmaceutical industry. This new book presents a series of reviews describing studies which have resulted in the identification of potential new drug targets for age-related disorders. Much of this information has come from 'omic comparisons of healthy and disease states or from testing the effects of potential new therapeutic approaches. Each chapter will be presented in the context of specific chronic diseases or different therapeutic strategies, providing important information on disease mechanisms related to the aging process. This book will be of interest to researchers in the areas of aging and chronic disease, as well as clinical scientists, physicians, and major drug companies. With contributors from Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay and Vietnam, this is a timely follow up to Guest's previous book Reviews on New Drug Targets in Age-Related Disorders.

Introduction to Visual Computing: Core Concepts in Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing covers the fundamental concepts of visual computing. Whereas past books have treated these concepts within the context of specific fields such as computer graphics, computer vision or image processing, this book offers a unified view of these core concepts, thereby providing a unified treatment of computational and mathematical methods for creating, capturing, analyzing and manipulating visual data (e.g. 2D images, 3D models). Fundamentals covered in the book include convolution, Fourier transform, filters, geometric transformations, epipolar geometry, 3D reconstruction, color and the image synthesis pipeline.The book is organized in four parts. The first part provides an exposure to different kinds of visual data (e.g. 2D images, videos and 3D geometry) and the core mathematical techniques that are required for their processing (e.g. interpolation and linear regression.) The second part of the book on Image Based Visual Computing deals with several fundamental techniques to process 2D images (e.g. convolution, spectral analysis and feature detection) and corresponds to the low level retinal image processing that happens in the eye in the human visual system pathway.The next part of the book on Geometric Visual Computing deals with the fundamental techniques used to combine the geometric information from multiple eyes creating a 3D interpretation of the object and world around us (e.g. transformations, projective and epipolar geometry, and 3D reconstruction). This corresponds to the higher level processing that happens in the brain combining information from both the eyes thereby helping us to navigate through the 3D world around us.The last two parts of the book cover Radiometric Visual Computing and Visual Content Synthesis. These parts focus on the fundamental techniques for processing information arising from the interaction of light with objects around us, as well as the fundamentals of creating virtual computer generated worlds that mimic all the processing presented in the prior sections.The book is written for a 16 week long semester course and can be used for both undergraduate and graduate teaching, as well as a reference for professionals.

This volume emphazises the most recent advances in fracture mechanics as specifically applied to steel bar reinforced concrete. Fracture mechanics has been applied to plain and fibre reinforced concrete with increasing success over recent years. This workshop extended these concepts to steel bar reinforced and pre-stressed concrete design. Particularly for high strength concrete, which is a very brittle material, and in the case of large structural members, the application of fracture mechanics appears to be very useful for improving the present design rules. The pre-eminent participants at the Turin workshop contributed extensive expert opinions in four selected areas for which a rational approach, using fracture mechanics, could introduce variations into the concrete design codes: size effects; anchorage and bond; minimum reinforcement for elements in flexure; and shear resistance. The 23 chapters logically address these themes and demonstrate the unique ability of fracture mechanics to capture all the experimentally observed characteristics. The book is primarily directed to the researchers in universities and institutions and will be of value to consultants and engineering companies.

Bachelor Thesis from the year 2020 in the subject Environmental Sciences, grade: 1,2, University of Applied Sciences Saarbr羹cken (Fakult瓣t Wirtschaftswissenschaften), language: English, abstract: This research analyses the extent to which sustainability at a festival can be managed and how desirable behaviour can be communicated and established. With decreasing profits through record sales, artists increasingly depend on live performances and touring. As it is common knowledge that big music festivals often harm the environment, visitors expect event organizers to comply with sustainable measures. Festival managers are, however, restricted in their implementation of eco-friendly practices, as an event is dependent on the interaction of many stakeholders. Music festivals offer a unique opportunity for event managers to attempt to influence attendee's behaviour to be more sustainable through their diversity and playfulness. By creating the appropriate framework, festival creators can shift a festival towards sustainability. To do that, they must understand their stakeholders' values, motivators, drivers, and barriers of greening an outdoor music festival. This paper is based on data derived from existing research and literature in the fields of event management, sustainability, sociology and behavioural research. It illustrates basic greening approaches along with the operational limits of event organizers.

Out of all different energies, electrical energy is the one which has maximum utilities in present society. Many equipments uses electrical energy. Electric power is obtained in large scale from thermal power plants which uses conventional sources of energy like coal, petroleum oil, natural gas, etc. These conventional sources like coal, petroleum oil, natural gas, etc. are depleting in nature, which will get exhausted in near future. Hence an alternative means should be developed which will maintain the present and future demands of electricity of society. Some of the alternatives for electric power generation are solar photovoltaic (SPV) technology and fuel cell technology. Both SPV and fuel cell technology generates direct current (DC). SPV technology uses photovoltaic cell which generates current by utilizing solar radiation and fuel cell technology generates current by electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas in a cell which is called fuel cell. In the present book, a brief outline of SPV technology and fuel cell technology is presented. Throughout the text attempt has been made to present the subject matter in a simple, lucid, and precise manner.

Cropping system refers to the temporal and spatial arrangement of different crops to exploit natural resources and enhance productivity per unit area and time (Gurigbal, 2010). The practice of cultivating two or more crops in the same space at the same time is common among smallholder farmers (Seran and Brintha, 2010). These intercropping systems mostly involves cereals and legumes (Ijoyah, 2012), particularly maize-soyabean, maize-cowpea, maize-groundnuts, millet-groundnuts and rice-pulses (Matusso et al, 2012). Several research works have been reported by scientists on cereal-legume intercropping (Egbe, 2010; Osman et al, 2011; Ijoyah, 2012) with intercropping successes as compared to monocropping. Intercropping system is known to make a more efficient use of growth factors as the crops capture and make a better use of radiant energy (Matusso et al, 2012) available water and nutrients.

Geo-environmental terrain assessments and territorial zoning are useful tools for the formulation and implementation of environmental management issues (including policy-making, planning, and enforcement of statutory regulations). They usually involve a set of procedures and techniques for delimitation, characterization and classification of terrain units. However, terrain assessments and zoning exercises are often costly and time-consuming, particularly when encompassing large areas. Bhavani basin (Study area) is the fourth largest (about 6,500 km2) sub-basin in the Cauvery basin (81,000 km2). The western part (Western Ghats) is hilly terrain with an altitude ranging from 300 to 2,400 metres. The northern and north-eastern (Eastern Ghats), the southern and south-eastern sides of the basin are dominated by rugged discontinuous hills, with altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,000 metres. LANDSAT ETM+ data is one of the best River Basin models that can be used for understanding the geology, geomorphology, hydrology as well as agricultural productivity. It is also proved that the model can be employed under different climate change as well as management scenarios for developing adaptation.

From the present book, it can be concluded that bioaccessibility of minerals estimated by in vitro technique was found to be higher in mustard cake as compared to GNC. Bioavailability determined by in vivo technique, showed higher value for apparent absorption in mustard fed group than GNC fed group, so from present book it can be concluded that the mustard cake is a better source of bioavailable minerals. Value obtained with in vitro experiments were higher as compared to in vivo study, though the trend was similar thus it can be inferred from that finding in vitro method can be used for prediction of mineral release from feeds and forages, however validation by actual feeding is required before accepting the bioavailability or absorption coefficient values while considering these for dietary requirements.

Fire is rarely out of the headlines, from large natural wildfires raging across the Australian or Californian countrysides to the burning of buildings such as the disasters of Grenfell tower and Notre Dame. Fire on these scales can represent a serious risk to human life and property. But the advent of fire made and controlled by humans also represented a crucial point in our evolution, allowing us to cook our food, forge our weapons, and warm our homes. This Very Short Introduction covers the fundamentals of fire, whether wild or under human control, starting with the basics of ignition, combustion, and fuel. Andrew Scott considers both natural wildfires and the role of humans in making and suppressing fire. Despite frightening reports of wildfire destruction, he also shows how landscape fires have been part of our planet's history for 400 million years, and do not always have to be extinguished. He also considers the problem of fires in urban settings, including new ways to prevent fires. The cost of wildfire can be steep - as well as the burning, post-fire erosion and flooding can have a great impact on both humans and the environment. It can also have a lasting effect in shaping ecosystems and plant life. Scott ends by examining the relationship between fire and the climate, and considering the future of wildfire in a warming world. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.

In A Haven in the Sun, nature writer B. C. Robison presents a unique portrayal of birds of the Texas Coast. Through the stories of birds that have a special bond with coastal Texas--Attwater's Prairie Chicken, White-tailed Hawk, Whooping Crane, Redhead, and migratory shorebirds and songbirds--Robison shows not only the importance of the Texas Coast to North American bird life but also the intimate dependence of coastal birds on our use of the land. At the heart of these stories lies the natural landscape and an account of how we have altered it to the benefit or harm of our native birds. The Laguna Madre, the great ranches of South Texas, the marshes of Aransas, the coastal prairie, and the famed migratory sanctuaries of Bolivar Flats and the oak woods of High Island have all played a vital role in our vibrant coastal bird life. Throughout the book, Robison asks several crucial questions: How can there be enough room for birds and people in the crowded world of the Texas Coast? Will we be endowed with this panorama of bird life twenty-five or fifty years from now? What can we do to help preserve this rich natural heritage? More story than polemic and more conversation than taxonomy, A Haven in the Sun will appeal to anyone who cares about bird life and its future on the Texas Coast.

A human and global take on a beloved vacation spot.  The crash of surf, smell of salted air, wet whorls of sand underfoot. These are the sensations of the beach, that environment that has drawn humans to its life-sustaining shores for millennia. And while the gull's cry and the cove's splendor have remained constant throughout time, our relationship with the beach has been as fluid as the runnels left behind by the tide's turning.The Lure of the Beach is a chronicle of humanity's history with the coast, taking us from the seaside pleasure palaces of Roman elites and the aquatic rituals of medieval pilgrims, to the venues of modern resort towns and beyond. Robert C. Ritchie traces the contours of the material and social economies of the beach throughout time, covering changes in the social status of beach goers, the technology of transport, and the development of fashion (from nudity to Victorianism and back again), as well as the geographic spread of modern beach-going from England to France, across the Mediterranean, and from nineteenth-century America to the world. And as climate change and rising sea levels erode the familiar faces of our coasts, we are poised for a contemporary reckoning with our relationship--and responsibilities--to our beaches and their ecosystems. The Lure of the Beach demonstrates that whether as a commodified pastoral destination, a site of ecological resplendency, or a flashpoint between private ownership and public access, the history of the beach is a human one that deserves to be told now more than ever before.

This book investigates the world of leading indicators and explores how they can be used effectively, providing 21st-century safety professionals with alternative metrics and guidance, which will enable them to make a difference in managing risk within an organization. The safety and health profession has been hindered by ineffective metrics for decades, with the primary metrics of choice being the OSHA incident rate and lost time accident rate. This narrow focus on what constitutes loss is not in line with the new concepts of managing the total risk that an organization faces. The book looks at indicators on a tactical level where they can be very effective in providing management with clear direction and ""manageable"" items they can utilize to elevate the safety efforts of an organization. It also explores the limitations of leading indicators at the strategic level and how they're tied into the management merit review system to determine bonus and salary increase structures. It features measurements of areas of loss not usually considered by safety managers, suggests ways to use leading indicators, and promotes a departure from traditional ""body count"" thinking. This book will be of interest to safety professionals involved in risk management in the modern workplace.

On Monday, April 8, 2024, a total eclipse of the Sun will be visible from parts of the United States and Canada. Although a partial eclipse will be seen from all of North America, the total phase in which the Moon completely covers the Sun (known as totality) will only be seen from within the 120-mile-wide path of the Moon's umbral shadow as it sweeps cross Mexico, the United States (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), and Canada (Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland). The Road Atlas for the Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 contains a comprehensive series of 26 maps of the path of totality across Mexico, the USA and Canada. The large scale (1 inch = 22 miles) shows both major and minor roads, towns and cities, rivers, lakes, parks, national forests, wilderness areas and mountain ranges. The path of totality on each map is depicted as a lightly shaded region with the northern and southern limits clearly identified. The total eclipse can only be seen inside this path. The closer one gets to the central line of the path, the longer the total eclipse lasts. Gray lines inside the path mark the duration of the total eclipse in 30 second steps. This makes it easy to estimate the duration of totality from any location in the eclipse path.Armed with this atlas and the latest weather forecasts, the road warrior is ready to chase totality no matter where it takes him/her along the entire path. This mobile strategy offers the highest probability of witnessing the spectacular 2024 total eclipse in clear skies.

The use of environmental data to support science, technology, and marine operations has evolved dramatically owing to long-term ocean observatories, unmanned platforms, satellite and coastal remote sensing, data assimilative numerical models, and high-speed communications. Actionable environmental information is regularly produced and communicated from quality-controlled measurements and skillful forecasts. The characterization of complex oceanographic processes is more difficult compared to inland features because of the difficulty in obtaining observations from often remote and hazardous locations. Regardless, coastal and ocean engineering projects and operations require the collection and analysis of meteorological and oceanographic data to fill information gaps and the running of numerical models to characterize regions of interest. Data analytics are also essential to integrate disparate marine data from national archives, in situ sensors, imagery, and numerical models to meet project requirements. Holistic marine environmental characterization is essential for data-driven decision making across the science and engineering lifecycle (e.g., research, production, operations, end-of-life). Many marine science and technology projects require the employment of an array of instruments and models to characterize spatially and temporally variable processes that may impact operations. Since certain environmental conditions will contribute to structural damage or operational disturbances, they are described using statistical parameters that have been standardized for engineering purposes. The statistical description should describe extreme conditions as well as long- and short-term variability. These data may also be used to verify and validate models and simulations. Environmental characterization covers the region where engineering projects or maritime operations take place. For vessels that operate across a variety of seaways, marine databases and models are essential to describe environmental conditions. Data, which are used for design and operations, must cover a sufficiently long time period to describe seasonal to sub-seasonal variations, multi-year, decadal, multi-decadal, and even climatological factors such as sea level rise, coastal winds, waves, and global ocean temperatures. Combined data types are essential for the computation of environmental loads for the region of interest. Typical factors include winds, waves, currents, and tides. Some regions may require consideration of biofouling, earthquakes, ice, salinity, soil conditions, temperature, tsunami, and visibility. Observations are also used for numerical forecasts, but errors may exist due to inexact physical assumptions and/or inaccurate initial data, which can cause errors to grow to unacceptable levels with increased forecasting times. Overall, marine environmental characterization tools, from observational data to numerical modeling, are critical to today's science, engineering, and marine operational disciplines.

Exploring the science in George R. R. Martin's fantastical world, from the physics of an ice wall to the genetics of the Targaryens and Lannisters.Game of Thrones is a fantasy that features a lot of made-up science--fabricated climatology (when is winter coming?), astronomy, metallurgy, chemistry, and biology. Most fans of George R. R. Martin's fantastical world accept it all as part of the magic. A trained scientist, watching the fake science in Game of Thrones, might think, ""But how would it work?"" In Fire, Ice, and Physics, Rebecca Thompson turns a scientist's eye on Game of Thrones, exploring, among other things, the science of an ice wall, the genetics of the Targaryen and Lannister families, and the biology of beheading. Thompson, a PhD in physics and an enthusiastic Game of Thrones fan, uses the fantasy science of the show as a gateway to some interesting real science, introducing GOT fandom to a new dimension of appreciation. Thompson starts at the beginning, with winter, explaining seasons and the very elliptical orbit of the Earth that might cause winter to come (or not come). She tells us that ice can behave like ketchup, compares regular steel to Valyrian steel, explains that dragons are ""bats, but with fire,"" and considers Targaryen inbreeding. Finally she offers scientific explanations of the various types of fatal justice meted out, including beheading, hanging, poisoning (reporting that the effects of ""the Strangler,"" administered to Joffrey at the Purple Wedding, resemble the effects of strychnine), skull crushing, and burning at the stake. Even the most faithful Game of Thrones fans will learn new and interesting things about the show from Thompson's entertaining and engaging account. Fire, Ice, and Physics is an essential companion for all future bingeing.

Plant growth depends on the use of two important natural resources, soil and water. Soil provides the mechanical and nutrient support necessary for plant growth. Water is essential for plant life processes. Effective management of these resources for crop production requires the producer to understand relationships between soil, water and plants. Knowledge about available soil water and soil texture will make deciding what crops to plant and when to irrigate easier. When these contents are low, it affects the growth and development of plant. We can identify the biochemical changes of C3 (rice) and C4 (maize) plants during water stress and determines how plants react in stressful condition, to identify the changes in morphological growth, physiological, chlorophyll contents, biochemical contents and enzyme contents. Through this book we can identify the importance of water and good types of soil for rice and maize cultivation.

A terrifically exciting account of [Slaght's] time in the Russian Far East studying Blakiston's fish owls, huge, shaggy-feathered, yellow-eyed, and elusive birds that hunt fish by wading in icy water . . . Even on the hottest summer days this book will transport you."" --Helen Macdonald, author of H is for HawkA field scientist and conservationist tracks the elusive Blakiston's Fish Owl in the forbidding reaches of eastern Russia I saw my first Blakiston's fish owl in the Russian province of Primorye, a coastal talon of land hooking south into the belly of Northeast Asia . . . No scientist had seen a Blakiston's fish owl so far south in a hundred years . . .  When he was just a fledgling birdwatcher, Jonathan C. Slaght had a chance encounter with one of the most mysterious birds on Earth. Bigger than any owl he knew, it looked like a small bear with decorative feathers. He snapped a quick photo and shared it with experts. Soon he was on a five-year journey, searching for this enormous, enigmatic creature in the lush, remote forests of eastern Russia. That first sighting set his calling as a scientist. Despite a wingspan of six feet and a height of over two feet, the Blakiston's fish owl is highly elusive. They are easiest to find in winter, when their tracks mark the snowy banks of the rivers where they feed. They are also endangered. And so, as Slaght and his devoted team set out to locate the owls, they aim to craft a conservation plan that helps ensure the species' survival. This quest sends them on all-night monitoring missions in freezing tents, mad dashes across thawing rivers, and free-climbs up rotting trees to check nests for precious eggs. They use cutting-edge tracking technology and improvise ingenious traps. And all along, they must keep watch against a run-in with a bear or an Amur tiger. At the heart of Slaght's story are the fish owls themselves: cunning hunters, devoted parents, singers of eerie duets, and survivors in a harsh and shrinking habitat. Through this rare glimpse into the everyday life of a field scientist and conservationist, Owls of the Eastern Ice testifies to the determination and creativity essential to scientific advancement and serves as a powerful reminder of the beauty, strength, and vulnerability of the natural world.

This book offers authoritative contributions by world experts actively working on different aspects of phototrophic prokaryotes. Providing up-to-date information in this rapidly advancing field, it covers the range of topics that are currently the focus of research with this group of organisms. As essentially single-celled organisms, phototrophic prokaryotes process many environmental signals and use this information to optimize their metabolism, growth rate, DNA replication and cell division. Phototrophic prokaryotes are collectively of great interest for a number of different fundamental and applied perspectives and have long served as models for understanding such basic fundamental biological processes as photosynthesis and respiration. On an ecological/environmental level they are extremely important, being the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on earth and responsible for the majority of the primary productivity in the oceans. They also hold great promise as biotechnological catalysts, being able to couple solar energy conversion through photosynthesis and carbon fixation to the production of biofuels, commodity chemicals and neutraceuticals. The book is recommended to advanced students and scientists dealing with life sciences, especially in genetics, microbiology and molecular biology.

This book provides a multidisciplinary review of antibiotic resistance and unravels the complex and interrelated roles of environmental sources, including pharmaceutical industry effluents, hospital and domestic effluents, wildlife and drinking water. Antibiotic resistance is a global public health issue in which the interface between humans, animals and the environment is particularly relevant. The contrasts seen across different environmental compartments and world regions, which are due to climate, social and policy differences, mean that this problem needs to be analyzed from a multi-geographic and multi-cultural angle. Bringing together contributions from researchers on different continents with expertise in antibiotic resistance in a range of different environmental compartments, the book offers a detailed reflection on the paths that make antibiotic resistance a global threat, and the state-of- the-art in antibiotic resistance surveillance and risk assessment in complex environmental matrices.

Three experiments were conducted to determine protein intake and the response of growing indigenous chickens to protein supplementation under free-ranging conditions. In the first experiment, data were collected from which a model was designed to estimate daily feed intake of free-ranging indigenous chicken from the Crop Contents (CC). The second experiment applied the model under on-farm conditions to estimate feed intake of free-ranging growers. Crude Protein (CP) intake was calculated as the product of crude protein concentration and total intake of feed. Results indicated that the mean protein level of CC was11.2%, Dry Matter Intake (DMI) of free-ranging growers was 78.3g/grower/day and the mean Crude Protein Intake (CPI) was about 8.5 g. In order to establish the response of the growers to protein supplementation in an on-farm set-up, the third experiment provided protein supplements at 0, 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 g CP/bird/day. Daily CPI for each of the four supplementary groups was calculated to be 8.5, 10.1, 11.7 and 13.3 g/bird.

The book tries to define the economic relevance of seaports to the national economy at a disaggregate level. The analysis is disaggregated by cargo types as the vessels call to the ports and hence generate economic activities that ripple through the economy. The quantitative estimates are concerned with the activities associated with the operations of Nigeria ports and the benefits derived to users of these ports. With the MARAD Port Economic Impact Kit, a sector analysis is made by computing an input-output table at national level. This reveal economic impact by cargo types: Containerized, RoRo, General, Dry bulk and Liquid bulk which further reveal the port's contribution to poverty reduction in terms of jobs created, tax revenue generated and enormous contribution to the GDP through value added. Data for 2002 and 2004 are used to project 2006 scenarios to reveal about 30% decline in economic impact growth; due to the overall decline in break-bulk/general cargo throughput which otherwise remains the highest generator of economic activities in ports.Estimates and framework proposed in the book is invaluable to researchers, the World Bank and policy makers in Developing Countries.

This is Volume II of the proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Argumentation: Reason to Dissent, held at the University of Groningen in June 2019. The European Conference on Argumentation (ECA) is a pan-European biennial initiative aiming to consolidate and advance various strands of research on argumentation and reasoning by gathering scholars from a range of disciplines such as philosophy, communication, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, discourse analysis, and more. The 2019 Groningen edition focused on dissent. The goal was to inquire into the virtues and vices of dissent, criticism, disagreement, objections, and controversy in light of legitimizing policy decisions, justifying beliefs, proving theorems, defending standpoints, or strengthening informed consent. The papers in these two volumes discuss these and other questions pertaining to argumentation and dissent (among other themes). They can be regarded as a reflection of the current state of the art in argumentation scholarship pertaining to dissent and disagreement, and thus should be of interest to a wide range of scholars in different disciplines.

Revision with unchanged content. Tropical rain forests contain most of the world's known biological diversity. Understanding how this diversity persists in the face of anthropogenic disturbance is an increasingly critical issue. To manage and preserve intact ecosystems, and to restore degraded ones, a better knowledge of the basic ecological processes that affect them is necessary. We must be able to answer such questions as: How are plant communities structured? How is diversity maintained in species-rich ecosystems? What ecological factors determine which plants grow where? Many processes are known to shape plant communities, but what is their relative importance? Approaching answers to these questions is the primary focus of this book. The book presents a case study, built upon experiments performed in a Peruvian rain forest. The author conducted a series of manipulative experiments on tree seedlings to dissect the various forces that shape their coexistence. This book is directed to an audience of ecologists, forest researchers, and conservationists.

A classic text on slate roof construction, now back in print Master slate roof builder Joseph Jenkins has brought back into print the classic ""Slate Roofs,"" first published in January, 1926, by the then nascent ""National Slate Association."" Other than a slight adjustment to the title, to be more compatible with a 21st-century readership, and a few corrections and stylistic changes, almost all the information is presented exactly as in the original publication, including anachronistic references. For example, in the editor's 52 years in the slate roofing industry, he has never heard of nor seen a ""flat slate roof"" other than in this publication. However, this book contains a wealth of information on which today's modern slate roofing industry is based, and therefore remains a valuable addition to the library of anyone interested in roofing, construction, architecture, and history. Included at the end of this publication are 21st-century guidelines for slate roof installation, repair, and restoration as published by the Slate Roofing Contractors Association of North America, Inc., as well as excerpts from Jenkins' own 2016 Slate Roof Bible (3rd edition).

University of Maryland-led study identified the first gene responsible for eye loss in cavefish, revealing connection to a human vascular disease.Mexican cavefish spend their entire lives in the dark. With no need for vision, many of them lost functional eyes. In more than 30 varieties of Mexican cavefish, the eyes stop developing as embryos grow into larvae. Although they are still the same species as a sighted, surface-dwelling fish (Astyanax mexicanus), the cave-dwelling varieties carry genetic mutations that scientists have yet to fully unravel.In a new study led by University of Maryland researchers, scientists have discovered that a mutation to the gene cystathionine beta-synthase ""a"" (cbsa) prevents blood flow to cavefish eyes during a critical phase of development. The lack of blood leads to withered, underdeveloped eyes covered by skin and connective tissue in all blind varieties of Mexican cavefish.

Genetics which is the study of genes, genetic variation and heredity in organisms has given an insight in understanding certain genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. It seeks to understand how genes are transmitted to offspring and variations occurring within organisms. Understanding inheritance patterns enable geneticists to predict the probability of an offspring inheriting certain traits or diseases. Using a digital photo print scanner, the author for the first time systematically and comparatively investigated the genetics and inheritance patterns of fingerprints and lip prints. Gender influence as well as genetic linkage between these polygenic traits and the possible use of these traits to establish parentage and solve paternity problems were also investigated. The concepts of penetrance and expressivity were linked to inheritance patterns of fingerprints and lip prints. Thus, through familial observation and tabular crosses, and statistical test the author in this book proposed different inheritance patterns for fingerprints and lip prints.

Process engineering can potentially provide the means to develop economically viable and environmentally friendly technologies for the production of fuel ethanol. Focusing on a key tool of process engineering, Process Synthesis for Fuel Ethanol Production is a comprehensive guide to the design and analysis of the most advanced technologies for fuel ethanol production from feedstocks. It describes how process systems engineering can be applied to fuel ethanol production to achieve new levels of efficiency according to technical, economic, and environmental criteria.Drawing on the authors' more than 15 years of process engineering and ethanol research, the book first focuses on liquid biofuels, before examining the role of process synthesis in the rapid and high-tech analysis and design of complex biotechnological processes. It then describes various types of feedstocks, including sugars, starchy crops, lignocellulosic biomass, and microorganisms, as well as hydrolysis technologies, such as saccharification. The authors cover the fuel ethanol production technologies for different feedstocks, the new technological innovations based on process integration to reduce energy consumption, and the environmental issues of bioethanol production. They also discuss the technological configurations for fuel ethanol production in the industry and the possible factors affecting food security with fuel ethanol production and consumption.Supported by case studies that include calculations and discussions of results, this book uses a process engineering approach to explore the analysis and development of fuel ethanol production from different feedstocks. It shows how accurate analysis and precise design, along with responsible government policies, can lead to fair and sustainable development of energy crops worldwide.

Modern Mushroom Growing 2020 Harvesting: A new comprehensive book by Pieter J.C. Vedder on global mushroom cultivation in 2020. A book in which his more than 60 years of knowledge, practical and international experience, and vision about the contemporary industry are recorded. Supplemented with scientific knowledge and insights he has acquired since his previous English book, published in 1978. A book for all mushroom growers in the world, that will contribute to the further optimization of their business operations.Pieter was the founder and principal of a school where the subject of mushroom cultivation in its full width was educated, but also subjects such as climate control, applied biology, chemistry, and economics. But above all a Training Centre where this theory was supported by a well-equipped modern instruction farm with year-round high production of top-quality mushrooms. And by this, a perfect example and instruction farm for all mushroom growers in the Netherlands and abroad.Pieter was the driving force behind this all, a man with a mission. His book 'Modern Mushroom Growing' was published in 8 different languages. The British Growers Association awarded him for his book and the mushroom courses, with the Sinden Award and stated that the book has found a place on every progressive grower's desk in the UK.

Global competition, corporate downsizing and corporate restructuring have forced many firms to reevaluate their operating methods. Today, corporations must do more with less while still watching the bottom line and improving profitability. ISO 14000 and ISO 9000, because of their similar management system requirements and auditing procedures, are good candidates for integration. This is the driving force behind Environmental and Quality Systems Integration.This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instruction for companies wishing to cut costs and integrate their Environmental Health and Safety System (ISO 14000) into an existing Quality Management System (ISO9000). Environmental and Quality Systems Integration serves to ease this transition and offers companies a way to meet quality assurance standards.

Neural networks represent a new generation of information processing paradigms designed to mimic-in a very limited sense-the human brain. They can learn, recall, and generalize from training data, and with their potential applications limited only by the imaginations of scientists and engineers, they are commanding tremendous popularity and research interest. Over the last four decades, researchers have reported a number of neural network paradigms, however, the newest of these have not appeared in book form-until now. Recent Advances in Artificial Neural Networks collects the latest neural network paradigms and reports on their promising new applications. World-renowned experts discuss the use of neural networks in pattern recognition, color induction, classification, cluster detection, and more. Application engineers, scientists, and research students from all disciplines with an interest in considering neural networks for solving real-world problems will find this collection useful.

The pioneering work by Nobel Prize Laureates Heeger, MacDiarmid, and Shirakawa marked the birth of conductive polymers, a new family of revolutionary organic materials at the boundaries between classic plastics, metals, and semiconductors. Since then, a host of chemically diverse conducting polymeric structures has been devised with fascinating optical, electrical, magnetic, and redox properties that can be tuned using easy chemical/electrochemical doping. In recent decades, the combination and blend of conductive polymers with other materials families (e.g., carbon nanomaterials, metal nanoparticles or oxide nanostructures, common polymers, and resins) fostered the advent of a new generation of hybrid multifunctional composites with enhanced properties and high potential for present and near-future everyday life applications, ranging from photovoltaics, OLEDs, smart windows and garments, plastic batteries for sensors, and intelligent actuators. In this book, we compile some of the latest advances in the field, covering both old issues and new examples emphasizing emerging applications in biomedical science, healthcare, separation science, and water pollution abatement.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS or RCA, What is it?　 Everyone uses the term, but everyone does it differently.　 Given that, how can we have any uniformity in our approach much less accurately compare our results?　 At a high level, we will explain the difference between a Root Cause Analysis and a Shallow Cause Analysis, because that is the difference between allowing a failure to recur or dramatically reducing the risk of recurrence. In this book we will get down to basics about 'RCA', the fundamentals of blocking and tackling, and explain the common steps of any investigative occupation. Those common investigation steps include:    Preserving evidence (data)/not allowing hearsay to fly as fact   Organizing an appropriate team/minimizing potential bias   Analyzing the events/reconstructing the incident based on actual evidence   Communicating findings and recommendations/ensuring effective recommendations are actually developed and implemented   Tracking bottom-line results/ensuring that identified, meaningful metrics were attained We explore 'Why don't things always go as planned?' When our actual plans deviate from our intended plans, we usually experience some type of undesirable or unintended outcome. We analyze the anatomy of a failure (undesirable outcome) and provide a step-by-step guide to conducting a comprehensive root cause analysis based on our 3+ decades of applying RCA as we have successfully practiced it in the field.  The book is written as a ""how-to"" guide to effectively apply the PROACT(R) RCA Methodology to any undesirable outcome, is directed at practitioners who have to do the real work, focuses on the core elements of any investigation, and provides a field-proven case as a model for effective application.  This book is for anyone charged with having a thorough understanding of why something went wrong, such as those in EH&S, maintenance, reliability, quality, engineering, and operations to name just a few.

Under the heading of the other Europe, this book presents the history and politics of European Big Science as an alternative road to (Western) European integration besides the mainstream political integration process of the European Economic Community and the European Union. It shows that Big Science has a role to play in European politics and policymaking and that the crucial and unavoidable symbiosis between science, technology and politics brings the creation of Big Science projects back to geopolitical realities.

The present research work includes an assessment of the physico-chemical parameters, biological conditions and fishery status of the Tungabhadra Reservoir, Hospet town, Bellary. The physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish fauna were studied in five topographically different sampling stations across the Tungabhadra Reservoir for the stretch of 58 Kms by water route. The scientific appraisal of plankton community provided information necessary for understanding of growth and abundance of fin-fish population. In the present study abundance and diversity of four major phytoplanktonic groups represented by Desmidaceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Bacillariophyceae were undertaken. It is clear from the results that the reservoir is mesotrophic and aging towards eutrophication especially in the upstreams. Hence measures should be taken to prevent influx of domestic sewage, entry of debris from the anthropocentric activities, industrial effluents from neighborhood and controlled disposition from the neighboring farm lands. Since the TBR is a joint venture operation of Hyderabad-Karnataka, yearly scientific documentation is useful for assessing its productivity.

If the intelligence of artificial systems were to surpass that of humans, humanity would face significant risks. The time has come to consider these issues, and this consideration must include progress in artificial intelligence (AI) as much as insights from AI theory. Featuring contributions from leading experts and thinkers in artificial intelligence, Risks of Artificial Intelligence is the first volume of collected chapters dedicated to examining the risks of AI. The book evaluates predictions of the future of AI, proposes ways to ensure that AI systems will be beneficial to humans, and then critically evaluates such proposals.The book covers the latest research on the risks and future impacts of AI. It starts with an introduction to the problem of risk and the future of artificial intelligence, followed by a discussion (Armstrong/Sokala/?h?igeartaigh) on how predictions of its future have fared to date. Omohundro makes the point that even an innocuous artificial agent can easily turn into a serious threat for humans. T. Goertzel explains how to succeed in the design of artificial agents. But will these be a threat for humanity, or a useful tool? Ways to assure beneficial outcomes through 'machine ethics' and 'utility functions' are discussed by Brundage and Yampolskiy. B. Goertzel and Potapov/Rodionov propose 'learning' and 'empathy' as paths towards safer AI while Kornai explains how the impact of AI may be bounded. Sandberg explains the implications of human-like AI via the technique of brain emulation. Dewey discusses strategies to deal with the 'fast takeoff' of artificial intelligence and, finally, Bishop explains why there is no need to worry because computers will remain in a state of 'artificial stupidity'. Sharing insights from leading thinkers in artificial intelligence, this book provides you with an expert-level perspective of what is on the horizon for AI, whether it will be a threat for humanity, and how we might counteract this threat.

This early work by Gilbert C. Bourne was originally published in 1910 and we are now republishing it. 'Herbert Spencer and Animal Evolution' is a lecture on Spencer's philosophy and his contribution to the understanding of evolutionary theory. Herbert Spencer was born on 27th April 1820, in Derby, England. In 1851 he published 'Social Statics' to great acclaim and his quietly influential 'Principles of Psychology' in 1955. These were followed by numerous works of sociology, psychology, and philosophy, which led him to become a prominent intellectual of his day. He also wrote 'The Developmental Hypothesis' (1852) which described the theory of evolution seven years before Charles Darwin's 'Origin of Species'. He even popularised the term ""Evolution"" and coined the phrase ""Survival of the fittest"", but his works did not contain the comprehensive theoretical system that Darwin's did, which is why his theory was not taken seriously at the time. Spencer's most famous idea was that of ""Social Darwinism."" He saw the process of organic evolution as being analogous to that of society, an idea influenced many intellectuals of the day.

Time-variable exposure profiles of pesticides are more often the rule than exception in the surface waters of agricultural landscapes. There is, therefore, a need to adequately address the uncertainties arising from time-variable exposure profiles in the aquatic risk assessment procedure for pesticides. Linking Aquatic Exposure and Effects: Risk Assessment of Pesticides provides guidance and recommendations for linking aquatic exposure and ecotoxicological effects in the environmental assessment of agricultural pesticides. Leading international scientists share their expertise in aquatic exposure assessment, aquatic ecotoxicology, and the risk assessment and management of plant protection products. The book incorporates the tools and approaches currently available for assessing the environmental risks of time-variable exposure profiles of pesticides. It also discusses the science behind these techniques. This volume covers the extrapolation techniques, including models that address the environmental fate, toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, and ecological effects, for performing accurate aquatic environmental risk assessments of pesticides. It explains how to link aquatic exposure and effects in the risk assessment procedure for plant protection products.

In Mystical Activism, we each hold the power to change the world right where we are. To call these ""end times"" is not hyperbole. We are in trouble and the signs are everywhere: extreme political divisions; xenophobic violence; enormous wealth inequity; poverty and homelessness; racism, sexism, and ageism; arms buildups and unending wars; and, most critical of all, terrifying climate disruption associated with man-made global warming. We are the cause of these dark times. Driven by left-brain beliefs, illusions and obsessions, humanity races headlong toward the collapse of civilization. Fortunately, the solution to these mounting crises also lies in the human psyche, arising from a most surprising source: the right-brain's natural mystical consciousness. Our survival depends on whether we grasp and resolve this paradox in time.

Flora of Indiana has served as the standard by which other state floras must be compared. Now over 60 years old, it has clearly withstood the test of time, and continues to be a primary source of information for any serious student of field botany. Deam insisted upon the highest standards for his work, and strove to make the Flora as accurate as possible. He examined over 84,000 specimens in preparation for the book, and from these he prepared keys, species accounts, and range maps showing species聶 occurrence by county. Although these maps reflect the knowledge only as it existed in 1940, they continue to be useful today in determining a species' general range in the state. This is especially helpful for the beginner, or one not familiar with Indiana's flora, as it can reduce the field of options when trying to determine an unknown plant's identity.Information in Flora has also been very useful in the restoration of landscapes. Because Deam collected plants in every township of the state, we have an excellent record of what occurred in an area historically. This has been especially helpful when attempting to restore areas that no longer possess their native vegetation. A prime example involves an area in Daviess County, Indiana, where a major restoration project conducted by the Division of Nature Preserves has relied heavily on the Flora and Deam's plant collection for guidance. Landscape restorationists throughout the state would do well by utilizing the Flora in similar fashion.

Commuting, the daily link between residences and workplaces, sets up the complex interaction between the two most important land uses (residential and employment) in a city, and dictates the configuration of urban structure. In addition to prolonged time and stress for individual commuters on traffic, commuting comes with additional societal costs including elevated crash risks, worsening air quality, and louder traffic noise, etc. These issues are important to city planners, policy researchers, and decision makers.GIS-Based Simulation and Analysis of Intra-Urban Commuting, presents GIS-based simulation, optimization and statistical approaches to measure, map, analyze, and explain commuting patterns including commuting length and efficiency. Several GIS-automated easy-to-use tools will be available, along with sample data, for readers to download and apply to their own studies.This book recognizes that reporting errors from survey data and use of aggregated zonal data are two sources of bias in estimation of wasteful commuting, it studies the temporal trend of intraurban commuting pattern based on the most recent period newly-available 2006-2010, and it focuses on commuting, and especially wasteful commuting within US cities. It includes ready-to-download GIS-based simulation tools and sample data, and an explanation of optimization and statistical techniques of how to measure commuting, as well as presenting a methodology that can be applicable to other studies.This book is an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners in geography, urban planning, public policy, transportation engineering, and other related disciplines.

The claims that EBM can herald a new theory of epistemology and a Kuhnian paradigm will be refuted.

Over 30 years ago and after several startling experiences, one of which was a Raincloud of Knowable Things, Dr. Groce created a conceptual framework that God can be defined as energy. He wanted to build the conception from the ground up and base it on physics and other natural sciences. The Religion of Physics begins with Einstein and voyages through Will and Space and the relationship between matter and anti-matter. Written for the person with an interest in science and without expertise in physics, the book presents a space-age perspective called E that acceptably melds science and religion. By using very simple physics and geometry with 65 diagrams and in an entertaining way, Dr. Groce shows how E expresses in everyday life. E can serve as religion for those with serious doubts about religion, or it can fortify those who want to continue with their own religious or philosophical thought, even atheism. For students of esoteric studies, it defines conceptions such as compassion, consciousness, time, life, the eternal now, purpose, being, and non-being in terms of everyday experience allowing a firmer understanding that clarifies the way to further study. Dr. Groce put the manuscript aside late in the last century and planned to release it well into the present century. That time is now.

Questions about variation, similarity, enumeration, and classification of musical structures have long intrigued both musicians and mathematicians. Mathematical models can be found from theoretical analysis to actual composition or sound production. Increasingly in the last few decades, musical scholarship has incorporated modern mathematical content. One example is the application of methods from Algebraic Combinatorics, or Topology and Graph Theory, to the classification of different musical objects. However, these applications of mathematics in the understanding of music have also led to interesting open problems in mathematics itself.The reach and depth of the contributions on mathematical music theory presented in this volume is significant. Each contribution is in a section within these subjects: (i) Algebraic and Combinatorial Approaches; (ii) Geometric, Topological, and Graph-Theoretical Approaches; and (iii) Distance and Similarity Measures in Music.

Analytical Pyrolysis of Natural Organic Polymers, second edition describes the methodology of analytical pyrolysis, the results of pyrolysis for a variety of biopolymers, and several practical applications of analytical pyrolysis on natural organic polymers and their composite materials. The author covers both distinct subjects of analytical pyrolysis methodology: the instrumentation used for pyrolysis, and the analytical methods applied for the analysis of the pyrolysis products. At the core of the book is the description of the results of pyrolysis for biopolymers and some chemically modified natural organic polymers. The main pyrolysis products of numerous compounds as well as the proposed mechanisms for their pyrolysis are described. In addition, the many applications of analytical pyrolysis are covered in detail, including topics such as polymer detection used in forensic science, structure elucidation of specific polymers, and identification of small molecules present in polymers (anti-oxidants, plasticizers, etc.). The applications to composite polymeric materials will be particularly useful in the fields of classification of microorganisms, study of biological samples, study of fossil materials, and so on. This thoroughly updated second edition brings the book into the 21st century, covering the many advancements seen over the last 20 years. The author has added crucial new content including several new sections discussing the harmful and potentially harmful compounds generated by pyrolysis, a new section on tar and pitches, a new chapter on natural organic dyes and pigments, and a new chapter on the analytical aspects of pyrolysis of biomass.

A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2020In this superbly articulate cri de coeur, Safina gives us a new way of looking at the natural world that is radically different.--The Washington Post New York Times bestselling author Carl Safina brings readers close to three non-human cultures--what they do, why they do it, and how life is for them. A New York Times Notable Books of 2020 Some believe that culture is strictly a human phenomenon. But this book reveals cultures of other-than-human beings in some of Earth's remaining wild places. It shows how if you're a sperm whale, a scarlet macaw, or a chimpanzee, you too come to understand yourself as an individual within a particular community that does things in specific ways, that has traditions. Alongside genes, culture is a second form of inheritance, passed through generations as pools of learned knowledge. As situations change, social learning--culture--allows behaviors to adjust much faster than genes can adapt. Becoming Wild brings readers into intimate proximity with various nonhuman individuals in their free-living communities. It presents a revelatory account of how animals function beyond our usual view. Safina shows that for non-humans and humans alike, culture comprises the answers to the question, ""How do we live here?"" It unites individuals within a group identity. But cultural groups often seek to avoid, or even be hostile toward, other factions. By showing that this is true across species, Safina illuminates why human cultural tensions remain maddeningly intractable despite the arbitrariness of many of our differences. Becoming Wild takes readers behind the curtain of life on Earth, to witness from a new vantage point the most world-saving of perceptions: how we are all connected.

Because the World MattersNew generations are championing responsibility for both the environment and those peoples who depend upon it in all new ways. Biblical Holism and Agriculture addresses the urgent need for constructing a holistic perspective, grounded in the Bible, to appraise the economic, social, ecological, environmental, and spiritual impact of globalization and the unprecedented impact of powerful agricultural technologies, and marketing systems. The holistic biblical perspectives within reference ancient Hebrew insights about responsible freedom for ""keeping"" the land by people created in the image of God as representatives commissioned to stewardship and justice.

There is a strange beauty at the heart of every mystery, and the mystery of the Carolina Bays is an enigma that is lushly, uniquely beautiful. How did these odd geomorphological features come to be formed in the landscape in the first place, with their uniform shapes and matching elliptical orientations scattered across the Carolinas? There are many hypotheses but no definitive answers. Why are these inland phenomena even called bays? There is no clear answer to that either. The best definition of these features are temporary, isolated freshwater wetlands, variously described as high or flatwater ponds, wet weather lakes, or vernal pools, often identified more accurately as pocosins, and they are ecological wonders, full of all manner of amphibians and reptiles, insects and birds, wildlife and plants--many of them exotic and rare. What also defines them is their uncommon beauty. Featuring more than one hundred-fifty color images, Carolina Bays takes you from an aerial perspective of these unusual bays to an on-the-ground safari, from frogs that croak and bark and boom to skinks that skim across the water as if on skis, and on to squawking herons to black-and-yellow polka-dotted caterpillars. There are growling alligators and four hundred-year-old trees and delicate yellow-fringed orchids. Life is found in astounding abundance. These wetlands are unique and almost immeasurably ancient; as is to be expected in the modern world, they are threatened by human intervention. Such diverse habitats and their rich, unmatched biodiversity call out for preservation and restoration. The bays are not only visited and documented by the authors; they make an impassioned case for respecting how important these singular formations are for the health of the planet. You could not find more able guides.

The 2019 Groningen edition focused on dissent. The goal was to inquire into the virtues and vices of dissent, criticism, disagreement, objections, and controversy in light of legitimizing policy decisions, justifying beliefs, proving theorems, defending standpoints, or strengthening informed consent. The papers in these two volumes discuss these and other questions pertaining to argumentation and dissent (among other themes).

The global biodiversity and climate emergencies demand transformative changes to human activities. For example, food production relies on synthetic, industrial and non-sustainable products for managing pests, weeds and diseases of crops. Sustainable farming requires approaches to managing these agricultural constraints that are more environmentally benign and work with rather than against nature. Increasing pressure on synthetic products has reinvigorated efforts to identify alternative pest management options, including plant-based solutions that are environmentally benign and can be tailored to different farmers' needs, from commercial to small holder and subsistence farming. Botanical insecticides and pesticidal plants can offer a novel, effective and more sustainable alternative to synthetic products for controlling pests, diseases and weeds. This Special Issue reviews and reports the latest developments in plant-based pesticides from identification of bioactive plant chemicals, mechanisms of activity and validation of their use in horticulture and disease vector control. Other work reports applications in rice weeds, combination biopesticides and how chemistry varies spatially and influences the effectiveness of botanicals in different locations. Three reviews assess wider questions around the potential of plant-based pest management to address the global challenges of new, invasive and established crop pests and as-yet underexploited pesticidal plants.

This accessible and entertaining biography chronicles the life and triumphs of astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort, who helped lay the foundations of modern astronomy in the 20th century. The book puts into context some of Oort's most significant achievements, including his discovery that the Milky Way rotates, as well as his famous hypothesis that our Solar System is surrounded by a reservoir of comets -- now simply known as the Oort Cloud.  Written by Oort's former student, this fascinating story also delves into Oort's pivotal role in the foundation of major astronomical facilities, including radio telescopes in the Netherlands and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which now operates the most successful astronomical observatories in the world. The book draws extensively on new archival research through the Oort Archives, along with personal reminiscences by Oort's son and astronomer-grandson, to paint a more detailed picture of Oort's life not just as an astronomer, but also as a husband, father, and citizen. The strong public interest in comets triggered by the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and the recently discovered interstellar comet in the Solar System make this book particularly timely.

The diversity crisis in paleontology refers not to modern biota or the fossil record, but rather how our discipline lacks significant representation of individuals varying in race, ethnicity, and other aspects of identity. This Element is a call to action for broadening participation through improved classroom approaches as described in four sections. First, a brief review of the crisis and key concepts are presented. Next, culturally responsive pedagogy and related practices are introduced. Third, specific applications are offered for drawing cultural connections to studying the fossil record. Finally, recommendations including self-reflection are provided for fostering your own cultural competency. Our discipline offers much for understanding earth history and contributing new knowledge to a world impacted by humans. However, we must first more effectively welcome, support, and inspire all students to embrace meaning and value in paleontology; it is critical for securing the future of our field.

The book recognizes that throughout the scientific, medical, and economic communities, new tests incorporating biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis of patients suffering from metabolic disorders. The early identification of those at risk of developing obesity will help to place these individuals on the best treatment course as early as possible for improved treatment outcomes. This will also help to cut costs incurred by the healthcare services. For all of this to occur, new research efforts are needed to identify novel biomarkers that can be used to predict the disease in the presymptomatic stage, for disease monitoring and for prediction of treatment response. It is also possible that new drug targets can be identified using these approaches which, in turn, can lead to the development of new treatment approaches. This volume also includes a series of reviews on biomarker discovery and usage in the study of diseases marked by perturbations in metabolism. It will describe the pros and cons of the various approaches and cover the successes and failures in this important research field.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been intensively investigated in the last few decades. Their origins differ: plant secondary metabolites, food/beverages aromas, fungal/bacterial volatiles, and others. VOCs typically occur as complex mixtures of compounds (e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, norisoprenoids, aliphatic/aromatic compounds, sulfur containing compounds, and others). They form through different biochemical pathways and can be modified or created during drying or maturation, thermal treatment, and others. Different conventional or modern methods of VOCs isolation, followed by the analysis with chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, usually provide different chemical profiles and have been under constant modification and upgrading. The ecological interactions are mediated by VOCs (inter- and intra-organismic communication) and they can act as pheromones, attractants, or alleochemicals. Among them, chemical biomarkers of botanical origin or chemotaxonomic markers may be found. Many VOCs possess different biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, and other activities. VOCs research from different sources is required to report their distribution and chemical profiles, and to discover new compounds. This Special Issue aims to attract up-to-date contributions on all aspects of VOCs chemistry, from challenges in their isolation to analysis, and on unlocking their biological activities or other useful properties

Social unrest, political activism, worry about human impact on this earth--sound familiar? In 1969, British Columbians were facing concerns that are still making headlines today. At the end of a decade of changing technological and political landscapes associated with draft dodgers, hippie flower power and the rise of the counterculture, a group of serious-minded citizens created Sierra Club BC to protect and preserve wild places in the province. From that moment, Sierra Club BC played an important role in many of the environmental issues in the province, from the protection of the Nitinat Triangle and the West Coast Trail in 1972; to the 1993 War in the Woods, the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history; to a twenty-year campaign that culminated in protection of the Great Bear Rainforest; to the ongoing opposition to the Site C Dam and the Trans Mountain pipeline. In fifty years, the club has helped to convince governments on both sides of the political spectrum to protect 15 per cent of BC's land base and just over 3 percent of BC's marine areas from development. Still active today, Sierra Club BC has thousands of members, volunteers and supporters, all working to protect the province's wild areas and confront climate change. Diane Pinch's non-fiction homage to Sierra Club BC provides an overview of the lasting impact the group has had, not only in BC, but in all of Canada. Replete with first-hand accounts, maps and photos, the book is a heartfelt in-depth look at environmentalism in Western Canada through the years, from the perspective of one of the most influential groups in operation. Sierra Club BC's philosophy of ""passion and persistence"" and commitment to science-based evidence and peaceful activism have given the club its incredible staying power.

The title of this book - The Fight to Stay Put - is both an homage to and a play on Chester Hartman's 1984 manifesto, The Right to Stay Put. It is here where Hartman first makes the case that property 'ownership' must be approached as much more than simply a purely economic matter: it is affective, it is emotional, it is personal. How people connect to place indelibly matters. On the one hand, fights to stay put can be seen as representations of struggles for social justice as they relate to place. On the other, they can be seen as the inevitable non-representational outcomes of territorial conflicts where fights for and over affective connections to place clash with those seeking monetary profit and power through re-productions of space. Media provides a particularly illuminating window into such fights and the social lessons that can be learned from them because of its ability to readily reveal intersecting narratives and wider processes impacting and composing place. These capacities of media are, perhaps, more important than ever today as forces of neo-liberal globalization and urban transformation and change continue to decentralize space. The trajectories of these fights and how they work through different concrete and imagined media landscapes form the basis of this book.

The gull is a familiar sight by the seaside, and one of the most recognisable bird species, but most people know surprisingly little about the lives and habits of these seafaring birds. John C. Coulson remedies this with a comprehensive overview of the gull.There are more than 50 known species of gulls, and many of these are well-adapted to living in urban areas and in close proximity to humans. But there are also less familiar species to discover, which keep their distance from beachgoers. This long-overdue addition to the New Naturalist library explains the thorny issues of gull taxonomy and classification, then introduces readers to what it means to be a gull, physically and genetically. Chapters are divided by larger gull groups, and within these, distribution, lifecyles and behaviours are examined, as well as acclimation to the human world. Colour photography throughout offers ample opportunity to get a sense of the variation within the gull group, and makes this book a pleasure to look through.

This book deals with the rare earth elements (REE), which are a series of 3 transition metals: lanthanum, cerium, gadolinium. They are relatively unknown to the wider public, despite their numerous applications and their critical role in many high-tech applications, such as high-temperature superconductors, phosphors (for energy-saving lamps, flat-screen monitors and flat-screen televisions), rechargeable batteries (household and automotive), very strong permanent magnets (used for instance in wind turbines and hard-disk drives), or even in a medical MRI application.

An ""eye-opening, sometimes alarming, and ultimately inspiring"" natural history of rivers and their complex and ancient relationship with human civilization (Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction). Rivers, more than any road, technology, or political leader, have shaped the course of human civilization. They have opened frontiers, founded cities, settled borders, and fed billions. They promote life, forge peace, grant power, and can capriciously destroy everything in their path. Even today, rivers remain a powerful global force -- one that is more critical than ever to our future. In Rivers of Power, geographer Laurence C. Smith explores the timeless yet underappreciated relationship between rivers and civilization as we know it. Rivers are of course important in many practical ways (water supply, transportation, sanitation, etc). But the full breadth of their influence on the way we live is less obvious. Rivers define and transcend international borders, forcing cooperation between nations. Huge volumes of river water are used to produce energy, raw commodities, and food. Wars, politics, and demography are transformed by their devastating floods. The territorial claims of nations, their cultural and economic ties to each other, and the migrations and histories of their peoples trace back to rivers, river valleys, and the topographic divides they carve upon the world. And as climate change, technology, and cities transform our relationship with nature, new opportunities are arising to protect the waters that sustain us. Beautifully told and expansive in scope, Rivers of Power reveals how and why rivers have so profoundly influenced our civilization and examines the importance this vast, arterial power holds for the future of humanity.""As fascinating as it is beautifully written.""---Jared Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Collapse, and Upheaval

Though most programmers use two or more languages, they usually have a mastery of one. Although Microsoft has advertised that the .NET runtime is language agnostic and that C# and Visual Basic .NET are so close that switching between the two is really quite easy, that's only true up to a point. Some of the differences are obvious, but others are very subtle. C# & VB.NET Conversion Pocket Reference helps you easily make the switch from one language to another.The differences occur in three main areas: syntax, object-oriented principles, and the Visual Studio .NET IDE. Syntax concerns the statements and language elements. Object oriented differences are less obvious, and concern differences in implementation and feature sets between the two languages. IDE differences include things like compiler settings or attributes. There is also a fourth area of difference: language features that are present in one language but have no equivalent in the other. These unique language features are also covered in this book.C# & VB.NET Conversion Pocket Reference is a perfect companion for documents and books that don't have examples using your mastered language. Author Jose Mojica expects that you know one of the two languages, but does not make anassumption about which one. He presents the information in alanguage-neutral point of view so that programmers from either background can read a section and feel that it is targeted to them.

The American plains bison, also known as buffalo, is an iconic and keystone Great Plains species. However, they almost disappeared from the face of the earth at the end of the 19th Century. Shortly thereafter, 20 bison were reintroduced to Wind Cave National Park in western South Dakota. A century later the herd not only survives, it prospers. But the recovery of bison is only part of the story. The Wind Cave bison reintroduction has been a 100-year experiment, and the park is the laboratory. This book describes the fascinating recovery of bison and the lessons to be learned from a hundred years of managing an imperiled species on a relatively small tract of land.

This is the first book focusing on bifurcation dynamics in 1-dimensional polynomial nonlinear discrete systems. It comprehensively discusses the general mathematical conditions of bifurcations in polynomial nonlinear discrete systems, as well as appearing and switching bifurcations for simple and higher-order singularity period-1 fixed-points in the 1-dimensional polynomial discrete systems. Further, it analyzes the bifurcation trees of period-1 to chaos generated by period-doubling, and monotonic saddle-node bifurcations. Lastly, the book presents methods for period-2 and period-doubling renormalization for polynomial discrete systems, and describes the appearing mechanism and period-doublization of period-n fixed-points on bifurcation trees for the first time, offering readers fascinating insights into recent research results in nonlinear discrete systems.

**The instant New York Times bestseller***An international bestseller* ""Hugely impressive, a major work.""--NPRA pioneering and groundbreaking work of narrative nonfiction that offers a dramatic new perspective on the history of humankind, showing how through millennia, the mosquito has been the single most powerful force in determining humanity's fate.  Why was gin and tonic the cocktail of choice for British colonists in India and Africa? What does Starbucks have to thank for its global domination? What has protected the lives of popes for millennia? Why did Scotland surrender its sovereignty to England? What was George Washington's secret weapon during the American Revolution?  The answer to all these questions, and many more, is the mosquito.  Across our planet since the dawn of humankind, this nefarious pest, roughly the size and weight of a grape seed, has been at the frontlines of history as the grim reaper, the harvester of human populations, and the ultimate agent of historical change. As the mosquito transformed the landscapes of civilization, humans were unwittingly required to respond to its piercing impact and universal projection of power.  The mosquito has determined the fates of empires and nations, razed and crippled economies, and decided the outcome of pivotal wars, killing nearly half of humanity along the way. She (only females bite) has dispatched an estimated 52 billion people from a total of 108 billion throughout our relatively brief existence. As the greatest purveyor of extermination we have ever known, she has played a greater role in shaping our human story than any other living thing with which we share our global village.  Imagine for a moment a world without deadly mosquitoes, or any mosquitoes, for that matter? Our history and the world we know, or think we know, would be completely unrecognizable.  Driven by surprising insights and fast-paced storytelling, The Mosquito is the extraordinary untold story of the mosquito's reign through human history and her indelible impact on our modern world order.

This book introduces a fresh perspective on the conditions for the genesis of the first cell. An important possible environment of the prehistoric Earth has long been overlooked as a host to the perfect biochemical conditions for this process. The first complexes of continental crust on the early Earth must have already contained systems of interconnected cracks and cavities, which were filled with volatiles like water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This book offers insights into how these conditions may have provided the ideal physical and chemical setting for the formation of protocells and early stages of life.The authors support their hypothesis with a number of astonishing findings from laboratory experiments focusing on a variety of organic compounds, and on the formation of key cellular ingredients and of primitive cell-like structures. Moreover, they discuss the principles of prebiotic evolution regarding the aspects of order and complexity. Guiding readers through various stages of hypotheses and re-created evolutionary processes, the book is enriched with personal remarks and experiences throughout, reflecting the authors' personal quest to solve the mystery surrounding the first cell.

Culverts are required to be provided under earth embankment for crossing of water course like streams, Nallas across the embankment as road embankment cannot be allowed to obstruct the natural water way. The culverts are also required to balance the flood water on both sides of earth embankment to reduce flood level on one side of road thereby decreasing the water head consequently reducing the flood menace. Culverts can be of different shapes such as arch, slab and box. These can be constructed with different material such as masonry (brick, stone etc) or reinforced cement concrete.Since culvert passes through the earthen embankment, these are subjected to same traffic loads as the road carries and therefore, required to be designed for such loads. The scope of this has been further restricted to the structural design of box. The structural design involves consideration of load cases (box empty, full, surcharge loads etc.) and factors like live load, effective width, braking force, dispersal of load through fill, impact factor, co-efficient of earth pressure etc. The structural elements are required to be designed to withstand maximum bending moment and shear force.

 最新的C++11標準不僅讓程式員可以更清楚，簡單及直接的表達想法，而且可以寫出更有效率的程式碼。Bjarne Stroustrup是C++的設計者與最初的實作者，為了讓程式員可以更有效率地使用C++，他重新制定，擴增以及重寫官方參考手冊和教學手冊。

 《The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition》將C++語言(語言功能、抽象機制、標準函式庫以及關鍵設計技術)做了非常完整且詳細的說明。在整本書中，Stroustrup精心撰寫許多簡潔的C++11範例，目的在於闡明用法與程式設計。為了讓讀者能更深入地了解C++語言，作者在本書內容與ISO標準之間提供了大量的交互參照。

新的C++11涵蓋範圍包括：

 ‧支援並行處理
 ‧正則表達式、資源管理指標、亂數及功能更強大的容器
 ‧一致性的初始化行為、簡化的for迴圈述句、move語意、Unicode支援
 ‧Lambda、通用的常數運算式、掌控類別的預設行為、可變參數模板(variadic template)、模板別名(template alias)、使用者自定的字面常數
 ‧相容性議題

這本書所探討的主題包括：

 ‧基本的語言機制：型別、物件、作用域(scope)、儲存空間(storage)、運算法則等
 ‧模組化(modularity)的支援：命名空間(namespace)、原始檔、異常處理(exception handling)
 ‧C++抽象機制(包括：class、class階層體系、template)能同時支援傳統程式設計、物件導向程式設計、泛型程式設計(generic programming)
 ‧標準函式庫：容器(container)、演算法、迭代器(iterator)、通用工具(utility)、字串、資料流I/O、locale、數值(numerics)等

The scientific advances in life sciences and engineering are constantly challenging, expanding, and redefining concepts related to the biocompatibility and safety of medical devices. New biomaterials, new products, and new testing regimes are being introduced to scientific research practices. In order to provide clinically predictive results and to ensure a high benefit-risk ratio for patients, we need to optimize material and implant characteristics, and to adapt performance and safety evaluation practices for these innovative medical devices. Various characteristics related to materials and implant development such as raw materials composition, implant surface morphology, design, geometry, porosity, and mechanical properties need to be thoroughly characterized before evaluating the biological performance of implants. Furthermore, with the increase of regulatory demands, biological evaluation needs to ensure appropriate models and methods for each implant development stage. This book is a result of the Special Issue of Materials on ""Biomaterials and Implant Biocompatibility"", which focused on the recent progress in development, material testing, and the biocompatibility and bioactivity evaluation of various materials including, but not limited to, bioceramics, biopolymers, biometals, composite materials, biomimetic materials, hybrid biomaterials, and drug/device combinations for implants and prostheses with medical applications spanning from soft to hard tissue regeneration. The book covers aspects ranging from investigations into material characterization to in vitro and in vivo testing for the assessment of biological performance of advanced, novel biomaterials and implants.

The Conference addresses the subjects of regional development in an integrated way in accordance with the principles of sustainability. It has become apparent that planners, environmentalists, architects, engineers, policy makers and economists have to work together in order to ensure that planning and development can meet our present needs without compromising the ability of future generations. Effective strategies for management should consider planning and regional development, two closely related disciplines, and emphasise the demand to handle these matters in an integrated way. This conference provides a common forum for all scientists specialising in the range of subjects included within sustainable development and planning. These volumes contain papers from the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development and Planning and include papers from the following topics: City planning, Regional planning, Social and political issues, Sustainability in the built environment, Rural development, Cultural heritage, Transportation, Safety of users in road evacuation, Ecosystems analysis, protection and remediation, Environmental management, Environmental impact assessment, Indicators of sustainability, Sustainable solutions in developing countries, Sustainable tourism, Resources management, Waste management.

Exploring the science in George R. R. Martin's fantastical world, from the physics of an ice wall to the genetics of the Targaryens and Lannisters.Game of Thrones is a fantasy that features a lot of made-up science--fabricated climatology (when is winter coming?), astronomy, metallurgy, chemistry, and biology. Most fans of George R. R. Martin's fantastical world accept it all as part of the magic. A trained scientist, watching the fake science in Game of Thrones, might think, ""But how would it work?"" In Fire, Ice, and Physics, Rebecca Thompson turns a scientist's eye on Game of Thrones, exploring, among other things, the science of an ice wall, the genetics of the Targaryen and Lannister families, and the biology of beheading. Thompson, a PhD in physics and an enthusiastic Game of Thrones fan, uses the fantasy science of the show as a gateway to some interesting real science, introducing GOT fandom to a new dimension of appreciation. Thompson starts at the beginning, with winter, explaining seasons and the very elliptical orbit of the Earth that might cause winter to come (or not come). She tells us that ice can behave like ketchup, compares regular steel to Valyrian steel, explains that dragons are ""bats, but with fire,"" and considers Targaryen inbreeding. Finally she offers scientific explanations of the various types of fatal justice meted out, including beheading, hanging, poisoning (reporting that the effects of ""the Strangler,"" administered to Joffrey at the Purple Wedding, resemble the effects of strychnine), skull crushing, and burning at the stake. Even the most faithful Game of Thrones fans will learn new and interesting things about the show from Thompson's entertaining and engaging account. Fire, Ice, and Physics is an essential companion for all future bingeing.

This comprehensive synthesis of current medical and evolutionary literature addresses key questions about the role body fat plays in human biology. It explores how body energy stores are regulated, how they develop over the life-course, what biological functions they serve, and how they may have evolved. There is now substantial evidence that human adiposity is not merely a buffer against the threat of starvation, but is also a resource for meeting the energy costs of growth, reproduction and immune function. As such it may be considered as important in our species evolution as other traits such as bipedalism, large brains, and long life spans and developmental periods. Indeed, adiposity is integrally linked with these other traits, and with our capacity to colonise and inhabit diverse ecosystems. It is because human metabolism is so sensitive to environmental cues that manipulative economic forces are now generating the current obesity epidemic.

This open access book focuses on the linear selection index (LSI) theory and its statistical properties. It addresses the single-stage LSI theory by assuming that economic weights are fixed and known - or fixed, but unknown - to predict the net genetic merit in the phenotypic, marker and genomic context. Further, it shows how to combine the LSI theory with the independent culling method to develop the multistage selection index theory. The final two chapters present simulation results and SAS and R codes, respectively, to estimate the parameters and make selections using some of the LSIs described. It is essential reading for plant quantitative geneticists, but is also a valuable resource for animal breeders.

In the space of one generation major changes have begun to take place in the field of human reproduction. A rapid increase in the control of fertility and the understanding and treatment of sexual health issues have been accompanied by an emerging threat to reproductive function linked to increasing environmental pollution and dramatic changes in lifestyle. Organised around four key themes, this book provides a valuable review of some of the most important recent findings in human reproductive ecology. Major topics include the impact of the environment on reproduction, the role of physical activity and energetics in regulating reproduction, sexual maturation and ovulation assessment and demographic, health and family planning issues. Both theoretical and practical issues are covered, including the evolution and importance of the menopause and the various statistical methods by which researchers can analyse characteristics of the menstrual cycle in field studies.

The Brusselator is a mathematical model for autocatalytic reaction, which was proposed by Ilya Prigogine and his collaborators at the Universit矇 Libre de Bruxelles. The dynamics of the Brusselator gives an oscillating reaction mechanism for an autocatalytic, oscillating chemical reaction. The Brusselator is a slow-fast oscillating chemical reaction system. The traditional analytical methods cannot provide analytical solutions of such slow-fast oscillating reaction, and numerical simulations cannot provide a full picture of periodic evolutions in the Brusselator. In this book, the generalized harmonic balance methods are employed for analytical solutions of periodic evolutions of the Brusselator with a harmonic diffusion. The bifurcation tree of period-1 motion to chaos of the Brusselator is presented through frequency-amplitude characteristics, which be measured in frequency domains. Two main results presented in this book are:  - analytical routes of periodical evolutions to chaos and - independent period-(2

Large landslides affect many mountain valleys in Europe. They are characterised by a low probability of evolution into a catastrophic event but can have very large impacts on population, infrastructures and the environment. This impact is becoming more and more pronounced due to increasing tourism and the construction of new roads and railways in mountainous areas. Methodologies for the assessment and mitigation of risks are therefore a major issue. Since very large slope movements are quite often directly or indirectly implicated in disasters, like landslides, secondary slides or debris flow, their early identification is essential to an adequate risk assessment of the zones involved.The assessment of risks due to large landslides in the alpine environment is the first activity carried out within the IMIRILAND Project. This project involves seven partners representing five European countries and is funded by the European Commission within the Fifth Framework Program (Research and Technological Development, Activities of a Generic Nature: the Fight against Major Natural and Technological Hazards). The objective of this cooperation is to develop risk management methodologies and mitigation strategies that can be applied at a European level as useful tools for administrators and land users.To this end, by means of a multidisciplinary approach the hazard analysis of some selected large landslides was examined with a particular focus on geological, geomorphological and geo-mechanical methods. In addition, vulnerability and risk analyses were carried out to enable the consideration of direct and indirect consequences, as well as technical and social impacts. The developed risk assessment procedure was critically examined through application to some selected landslides. Identification and Mitigation of Large Landslide Risks in Europe - Advances in Risk Assessment presents the risk assessment procedure developed and the case studies that were performed within the framework of the IMIRILAND Project. It is edited by Arpa Piemonte, Ecole Polytechnique F矇d矇rale de Lausanne and Politecnico di TorinoThis book is intended for geotechnical engineers, engineering geologists, geomorphologists and planners who are involved in landslides and in assessing the stability of natural slopes.

A vigorous response to the challenges of incorporating computer use into the teaching and learning of stochastic processes, this book takes an applications- and computer-oriented approach rather than the standard formal and mathematically rigorous approach. It is suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in operations research, management science, finance, engineering, statistics, computer science, and applied mathematics. Prerequisites are intermediate-level calculus, elementary linear algebra, and an introductory course in probability with an emphasis in operational skills on conditioning.  The first chapter reviews some preliminary materials, including transform methods and basic concepts in mathematical analysis. Subsequent chapters explore variants of Poisson processes, renewal processes, discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains, Markov renewal and semi-regenerative processes, and Brownian motion and other diffusion processes. Each chapter concludes with problems, bibliographic notes, references, and an Appendix. A Solutions Manual is available to instructors upon request.

El secado solar surge como una forma tecnificada del secado tradicional de alimentos y cada vez tiene m獺s relevancia en la actualidad debido a sus ventajas t矇cnicas, econ籀micas y comerciales. Las tecnolog穩as de secado solar directo e indirecto (con incidencia o no de la radiaci籀n solar sobre el alimento) puede tener diversos efectos, no necesariamente negativos, dependiendo de los par獺metros operacionales del sistema de secado al que es sometido el alimento. Se ha demostrado que utilizando la energ穩a solar se pueden obtener productos con propiedades nutrac矇uticas similares y en algunos casos superiores que en aquellos alimentos que fueron secados por medios convencionales. Actualmente se realizan estudios con el objetivo de escalar estas tecnolog穩as para su introducci籀n en la agroindustr穩a y mejorar la calidad de los alimentos secos, disminuir las p矇rdidas postcosecha y contribuir a la seguiridad alimentaria y nutricional mediante la conservaci籀n y disponibilidad de los alimentos de una forma sustentable.

This is the first text devoted exclusively to the subject of nonsteady, compressible, internal flow theory and the application of this theory to practical devices. The need for such a text has become apparent with the availability of commercial equipment dependent upon this type of flow phenomena. The book is usable both as a text for graduate level courses and as an introduction for readers wishing to become familiar with nonsteady flow phenomena and their practical applications. This audience consists of mechanical, chemical, and aerospace engineers; and specialists in fluid mechanics. The first and second chapters are introductory in nature, aiming to assist readers conversant with the concepts of steady flow to adjust to unfamiliar events and circumstances while avoiding the finer details of algebraic manipulation. A generalized derivation of the classical method-of-characteristics as applied to one-dimensional, nonsteady, internal flows is included in chapter three. Chapter four is devoted to a study of the various boundary conditions necessary for handling a wide range of problems. Chapter five deals with methods of solution including both graphical and numerical procedures. The remaining five chapters explore specific fields of application. These include pipeline flows, dynamic pressure exchangers, pulse combusters and the tuning of the exhaust and induction systems of reciprocating, and Wankel type, internal combustion engines. Additional nonsteady flow devices are described in the last chapter. All the latter chapters are supported by appropriate references to available literature, including the basic material presented in the first half of the book. When necessary, additional specialized theoretical material is included in each of the special-topics applications-oriented chapters. In order to fulfill the needs of graduate students and their instructors, worked examples are included in addition to exercise problems.

	這本書是一本C++的經典之作，為了讓台灣的讀者不會有遺珠之憾，博碩文化特地引進本書，並將之編為《名家名著》系列第05號書籍。兩位作者的來頭都不小(請見作者簡介)，而本書更是作者十年磨一劍的經典之作。

	作者Koenig在C++的整個發展過程中具有舉足輕重的地位，是C++社群中最受尊敬的大師之一。他的文章以樸實而又精深的思想，準確而又權威的論 述，，成為業界公認的『正統C++之聲』。本書命名為《Ruminations on C++》充分顯現出作者的自信和對這本書的珍愛。

	本書命名為《C++沉思錄》，顧名思義，這是一本需要多加思考的書籍。作者在書中不斷強調『想一想』這件事，從思考的過程中，逐漸發展出具有實用性的 C++程式。就內容來看，這本書其實也可以命名為《C++設計模式》、《Thinking in C++》、《C++及STL的設計和演化》。

	這是一本進階書，對於初學C++的人來說並不適合。但對於已經學會C++語法，有過一小段撰寫C++程式經歷的人來說，本書有助於理解要怎樣才算是用對了C++來設計程式、為何C++要如此設計、STL當中的奧秘（例如iterator為何要如此設計）。

	在本書的範例程式碼中，作者從簡單的問題開始設計起，逐步擴充解決更多的問題，考慮周詳，並且充分應用了C++特有的功能（相對於Java而言），特 別是指標、運算子overload、friend等等的技術，這也是C++之所以複雜龐大的主因，然而既然選擇了C++作為開發工具，並因此付出了更多的 學習時間，若不將之應用出來，就太可惜了。讓我們來看看大師是如何充分應用各種C++的技巧來解決問題。

	這本書在C++的教學方式上有獨到之妙。作者循循善誘，娓娓道來，所舉的例子雖然小，但是非常典型，切中要害，讓你花費不大的精力就可以掌握相當多的東西。

	這本書與坊間大部分的C++書籍都不一樣，那些書所關注的是語言本身，而不是如何運用這種語言。

	作者對C++有著居高臨下的見識，對於C++的設計理念和實際應用有非常清晰的觀點。眾多紛繁複雜的C++特性如何組合運用，如何有效運作，什麼是主流，什麼是旁支，哪些是通用技術，哪些是特殊的技巧，在書中都有清晰明白的介紹。

	識字最多的人，一定是最好的作家嗎？能演奏最多音符的人，一定是最好的音樂家嗎？那些瞭解最多語言特性的人就是最好的程式設計師(這真是荒謬)。程式設計工作中最困難的部分並不是去學習語言細節，而是理解問題的解決之道。

	作者希望讀者能運用這些idea 去理解一堆拼湊的程式碼與一個抽象之間的差別──這種差別，就好像一堆辭藻與一篇文章、一堆音符與一支歌曲的差別一樣。C++支援好幾種不同的抽象形式，其中最著名的有抽象資料型態（ADT）、物件導向程式設計和泛型程式設計。

	全書多次強調，C++最基本的設計理念是用類別來表示概念，C++解決複雜性的基本原則是抽象，物件導向思想是C++的手段之一，而不是全部等等。這些言論可以說是擲地有聲，可引導許多C++程式設計師走向正確的道路。

	如果你是C++的高手，請試著讀讀本書，看看你能理解多少?多快理解?或許你會發現，原來要掌握博大精深的C++，並非麼簡單。

	如果您只是個剛學會C++的程式設計師，相信看完本書後，一定會發出『原來C++可以這樣做啊！』、『原來程式庫是這樣寫的啊！』、『原來遇到問題要這樣解決啊！』等等數不完的讚嘆之聲！

大師的推薦

	Koenig和Moo的《C++沉思錄》將會為許多人提供有用的幫助，對於C++究竟是什麼，以及能夠做些什麼，他們的先見之明，在這本書中隨處可見。——C++發明人 Bjarne Stroustrup

	對我來說，這是我所有C++藏書中最好的一本。——《C & C++ Code Capsules》作者 Chuck Allison

The numerical simulation of sheet metal forming processes has become an indispensable tool for the design of components and their forming processes. This role was attained due to the huge impact in reducing time to market and the cost of developing new components in industries ranging from automotive to packing, as well as enabling an improved understanding of the deformation mechanisms and their interaction with process parameters. Despite being a consolidated tool, its potential for application continues to be discovered with the continuous need to simulate more complex processes, including the integration of the various processes involved in the production of a sheet metal component and the analysis of in-service behavior. The quest for more robust and sustainable processes has also changed its deterministic character into stochastic to be able to consider the scatter in mechanical properties induced by previous manufacturing processes. Faced with these challenges, this Special Issue presents scientific advances in the development of numerical tools that improve the prediction results for conventional forming process, enable the development of new forming processes, or contribute to the integration of several manufacturing processes, highlighting the growing multidisciplinary characteristic of this field.

During the course of his career, photographer C. C. Lockwood has recorded the abundant natural beauty of Louisiana -- particularly the Atchafalaya Basin -- and the rest of the Gulf Coast, from Florida to Texas. In this book Lockwood travels to the other side of the Gulf to present an unparalleled look at the untamed wonders of the Yucat獺n Peninsula.The specific emphases of The Yucat獺n Peninsula are the Mexican states of Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucat獺n. Avoiding such tourist-trampled ports of call as Cozumel and Cancun, Lockwood focuses instead on less accessible wilderness areas. With the assistance of trained explorers as well as native volunteers, Lockwood visited, over a two-year period, such hidden treasures of the Yucat獺n as Arrecife Alacr獺n and Banco Chinchorro, two coral-laden reefs; Sian Ka'an, a 1.2-million-acre wildlife refuge; and Calakmul, an area of dense jungle.These expeditions gave Lockwood the perfect opportunity to photograph the peninsula's astonishing array of animal life: rainbow-colored parrot fish and enormous lobsters, sea turtles and nurse sharks, flamingos and toucans, egrets and brown pelicans, iguanas and spider monkeys. Lockwood also captures the magnificent beauty of the land itself, with evocative shots of shimmering green vegetation, colorful flowers, and jungle sunrises. Stunning photographs of Mayan ruins, open-air markets with brimming stands of fruits and vegetables, and the expressive faces of the Yucatecans themselves complete this picture of unspoiled paradise.Lockwood's informal, yet informative text recounts many of his frequently hilarious, sometimes dangerous, and always interesting adventures. Lockwood also writes about the history of the Yucat獺n Peninsula and its various ecosystems.The Yucat獺n Penisula opens a window onto a world that most tourists never see.

IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, a deluge of .NET books has hit store shelves, each one eager to explain the new programming philosophy of the .NET world. In the excitement, many of these books have left out the tricks and insights you need to really master .NET programming. Part of the problem is that no single work can cover the entire .NET platform-a sprawling, ambitious framework that revolu- tionizes everything from Internet applications to data access technology. Many .NET books provide a good overview of essential concepts, but they can't deal with the subtleties needed for all types of development. This book represents the start of the second wave of .NET books: closely focused works that give you the insight of experienced developers about a single aspect of .NET programming. User Interfaces in C#: Windows Forms and Custom Controls takes a close look at all the ingredients you can use to design state-of-the- art application interfaces. It also delves into entirely new topics like custom control design and GDI+, the next-generation painting framework for Windows. You don't just learn about anchoring and docking, you work with examples that show document-view architecture, custom control layout engines, dockable windows, and hit testing with owner-drawn controls. You also learn how to design irregularly shaped forms, unshackle data binding, and build an integrated help system.

This book addresses a range of real-world issues including industrial activity, energy management, education, business and health. Today, technology is a part of virtually every human activity, and is used to support, monitor and manage equipment, facilities, commodities, industry, business, and individuals' health, among others. As technology evolves, new applications, methods and techniques arise, while at the same time citizens' expectations from technology continue to grow. In order to meet the nearly insatiable demand for new applications, better performance and higher reliability, trustworthiness, security, and power consumption efficiency, engineers must deliver smart innovations, i.e., must develop the best techniques, technologies and services in a way that respects human beings and the environment. With that goal in mind, the key topics addressed in this book are: smart technologies and artificial intelligence, green energy systems, aerospace engineering/robotics and IT, information security and mobile engineering, IT in bio-medical engineering and smart agronomy, smart marketing, management and tourism policy, technology and education, and hydrogen and fuel-cell energy technologies.

This newest edition of the classic guide for military officers is a necessity given the volatility of our current political climate. The Armed Forces Officer is much more than a how-to guide for military officers. It is a series of candid, timeless essays on the nature of the people who occupy the ranks of the military services. This invaluable resource for all those involved in the military highlights that our military is not just a collection of machines, processes, and regulations, but a very human endeavor whose proper understanding requires acknowledging that humans are what make our military the complex, potent, and wonderful organization that it is--a truth that can be applied to any organization, military or civilian, composed of people and all their mysterious complexities.  This is an updated and rewritten edition of the 1950 classic, The Armed Forces Officer. This edition includes a foreword by General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In secret, underground, an amazing new world has taken shape, an alternate universe where technical communications sit alongside bulletin boards devoted to TV sitcoms, popular music, and every imaginable sexual proclivity. The Internet has its own language, its own rituals, its own code of ethics, and even its own ways of punishing outsiders. Let the newbie beware! Surfing on the Internet is a fearless excursion through this remarkable new world, in the company of one of the most inventive young nonfiction writers at work today. Fueled by Fruity Pebbles and caffeine, J. C. Herz, a digital Dian Fossey loose in the jungle of Net life, embarks on an on-line odyssey. Beginning with worldwide message boards that feature tips for phreaking (phone tapping) and plots to assassinate Barney the purple dinosaur, she brings to life the anarchic sprawl of the Net, exploring the flames (personal tirades), the aliases (one guy she meets has 158), the Net cities and virtual saloons where the digerati congregate.No corner of the Net is beyond the reach of her curiosity, and some of those corners turn out to be pretty dark. Sex on-line has its limitations, for instance (although the cross-gender possibilities are intriguing). There are the out-and-out nuts who stretch even the most liberal free-speech ethos. And there's the chilling case of Kieran, the Internet ghost whose only off-line visitors for months are the people who deliver takeout food to his apartment. When last seen, J. C. Herz is checking into an Internet addicts support group - meeting on-line, of course. Surfing on the Internet is a romp through the frontier of the twenty-first century, and J. C. Herz is a brilliant and daredevil guide.Don't log on without it.

We may regard ourselves as the most advanced species on the planet, but have we really reached our optimum design? Isn't't there always room for improvements? Before you answer, let noted evolutionary biologist George C. Williams remind you of both the exquisite adaptations and absurd maladaptations nature has bestowed upon us, the self-proclaimed ""pinnacle of evolution.""Picking up where Darwin left off, Williams combines philosophical perspective and scientific method to provide a foundation for the answers to some fascinating questions. He explains why our bodies have to deteriorate so disastrously with old age. He gives us logical reasons to explain why we crave foods like sugar and fat that have been proven time and again to be detrimental to our health. And Williams single-handedly deflates our Homo sapiens sapiens ego with such insights as: Our eyesight -- it may seem superior, but not when compared to that of the invertebrate squid, whose eye has developed over time to prove more efficient than ours. And wouldn't't it make more sense to have a third eye, located on the back of the head? We could have stereoscopic vision in front and rear-vision warning us of danger sneaking up behind. Rear-view mirrors would become a thing of the past. And why stop at three eyes? This fascinating new book is markedly different from all previous work on evolutionary biology. Using the pony fish and its luminescent abdomen as the perfect evolutionary mystery, Williams explores the intricacies of nature's designs. Rather than telling us how or why the pony fish got its light, Williams explains the functional reasons why the pony fish keeps its light. He also explains why our species keeps arbitrary or malfunctioned features like the reproductive and excretory systems' sharing of parts. George C. Williams, one of today's most qualified evolutionary biologists, has written an important, entertaining, and thought-provoking addition to a science that has captivated the world for almost 150 years.

The story of numbers is a rich, sweeping history that shows how our mathematical achievements contributed to the greatest innovations of civilization. Calvin Clawson, acclaimed author of Conquering Math Phobia, weaves a story of numbers that spans thousands of years. As Clawson so clearly shows, numbers are not only an intrinsic and essential thread in our modern lives, but have always been an integral part of the human psyche - knit into the very fabric of our identity as humans. Clawson travels back through time to the roots of the history of numbers. In exploring early human fascination with numbers, he unearths the clay beads, knotted ropes, and tablets used by our ancestors as counting tools. He then investigates how numeric symbols and concepts developed uniquely and independently in Meso-America, China, and Egypt. As he persuasively argues, the mathematical concepts that arose and flourished in the ancient world enabled the creation of architectural masterpieces as well as the establishment of vast trade networks. Continuing the journey, Clawson brings us to the elegant logic of numbers that soon came to distinguish itself as a discipline and the language of science. From the concepts of infinity contemplated by the Greeks to the complex numbers that are indispensable to scientists on the cutting edge of research today, Clawson breathes life and meaning into the history of great mathematical mysteries and problems. In this spirit of inquiry, he explores, in their times and places, the discovery of numbers that lie outside the province of counting, including irrational numbers, transcendentals, complex numbers, and the enormous transfinite numbers. The personalities and the creative feats surrounding each mathematical invention come alive vividly in Clawson's lucid prose. In this work of breathtaking scope, Clawson guides us through the wonders of numbers and illustrates their monumental impact on civilization.

An insider account of how scientists unraveled the mystery of the thawing ArcticIn the 1990s, researchers in the Arctic noticed that floating summer sea ice had begun receding. This was accompanied by shifts in ocean circulation and unexpected changes in weather patterns throughout the world. The Arctic's perennially frozen ground, known as permafrost, was warming, and treeless tundra was being overtaken by shrubs. What was going on? Brave New Arctic is Mark Serreze's riveting firsthand account of how scientists from around the globe came together to find answers. In a sweeping tale of discovery spanning three decades, Serreze describes how puzzlement turned to alarm as researchers concluded that the Arctic is rapidly thawing due to climate change--and humans are to blame.

The productivity of castor following rabi short duration crop is lower. However, it can be enhanced through suitable agronomic practices. Among the different agronomic practices nutrient management and plant geometry play crucial role for achieving higher yield per unit area. Effect of plant population on yield is considerable as proper inter and intra spacing provides sufficient interception of sunlight and satisfactory absorption of nutrients and water from the soil, subsequently resulted in higher seed yield. Fertilizer is a key component of modern crop production technologies. The application of fertilizer is essential for increasing crop yields and farmers income even when crops are grown without irrigation under rainfed or in dryland condition. Each essential nutrient has certain specific function to perform in the plant and one element can't substitute for another.

A practical, bipartisan call to action from the world's leading thinkers on the environment and sustainability  Sustainability has emerged as a global priority over the past several years. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change and the adoption of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals through the United Nations have highlighted the need to address critical challenges such as the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, water shortages, and air pollution. But in the United States, partisan divides, regional disputes, and deep disagreements over core principles have made it nearly impossible to chart a course toward a sustainable future.  This timely new book, edited by celebrated scholar Daniel C. Esty, offers fresh thinking and forward-looking solutions from environmental thought leaders across the political spectrum. The book's forty essays cover such subjects as ecology, environmental justice, Big Data, public health, and climate change, all with an emphasis on sustainability. The book focuses on moving toward sustainability through actionable, bipartisan approaches based on rigorous analytical research.

學習iOS開發時，是否被那奇怪的Objective-C語法給困擾了呢？例如：NSString *myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@”Hello, World!”]; 這是什麼東東啊？要輸出一個Hello, World!有這麼難嗎？那些 [ ] 是什麼？怎麼類別後面還有一個alloc啊？哪個是方法的名稱呢？參數在哪裡？如果你會有這樣的反應，大概你之前的程式語言背景不是C++就是Java/C#。想要學好iOS的程式設計，搞懂Objective-C是不可避免的基本功。本書從頭開始讓你重新認識OOP程式設計—「傳送訊息給物件」，並搭配C++/Java/C#的比較，讓你學習起來更容易進入狀況。簡單來說，訊息有時候就是方法，例如「傳送訊息A給物件」代表「要物件執行方法A」，這樣是不是容易理解多了（當然當中還是有些微的差異，而本書也會提醒您差別在哪裡）。再舉一個初學者常見的問題，Objective-C方法的參數在哪裡？答案就在方法署名裡，例如下列的方法宣告：- (void)decreaseRentalByPercent:(float)percentage withMinimum:(float)min; 方法的全名是decreaseRentalByPercent: withMinimum: 。蝦密，方法名稱裡面有「:」，是的，而且「:」還代表參數的數量，所以上述方法有兩個參數（因為有兩個:），名稱分別為percentage與min。這樣說明，應該慢慢懂Objective-C了吧！這樣做有什麼好處呢？因為這樣在傳遞訊息（呼叫方法）時，就容易在看程式碼時理解要傳送的參數意義是什麼，而不需要再回頭看方法宣告或實作處。不過也因為這樣，所以Objective-C並沒有多載(overloading)這種機制喔（因為參數已經被方法名稱給描述了，更改參數的數量，方法名稱就不同了）。以上都是節錄自本書的說明，本書能夠讓你快速理解Objective-C語法，並輔以C++與Java/C#來做說明比較。是一本適合初學Objective-C的學習書籍。

In the context of this dissertation, methods were investigated that can contribute to a successful digitization strategy in experimental synthetic chemistry. Three areas were identified which could support a change in the current documentation and working methods. These are (1) the development of software for the processing of spectroscopic data and the comparison of the extracted results with the in silico predictions of the target compounds, (2) the generation of ML-based predictions for reaction control (reaction templates and reaction temperature) and (3) the automatic generation of reports from entries of an electronic laboratory journal. The work is a contribution to improve, facilitate, and accelerate scientific work in chemistry. Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation wurden Methoden untersucht, die zu einer erfolgreichen Digitalisierungsstrategie in der experimentellen synthetischen Chemie beitragen konnen. Es wurden drei Bereiche identifiziert, die hier insbesondere eine Veranderung der aktuellen Dokumentations- und Arbeitsweise unterstutzen konnen. Dies sind (1) die Entwicklung von Software zur Bearbeitung von spektroskopischen Daten und dem Ableich der extrahierten Ergebnisse mit den in silico-Vorhersagen der Zielverbindungen, (2) die Generierung von ML-basierten Vorhersagen fur die Reaktionsfuhrung (Reaktionstemplates und Reaktionstemperatur) und (3) die automatische Erstellung von Berichten aus Eintragen eines elektronischen Laborjournals. Die entwickelten Modelle werden jeweils diskutiert und analysiert.

Develop a comprehensive plan for building a HIPAA-compliant security operations center, designed to detect and respond to an increasing number of healthcare data breaches and events. Using risk analysis, assessment, and management data combined with knowledge of cybersecurity program maturity, this book gives you the tools you need to operationalize threat intelligence, vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident response processes to effectively meet the challenges presented by healthcare's current threats.  Healthcare entities are bombarded with data. Threat intelligence feeds, news updates, and messages come rapidly and in many forms such as email, podcasts, and more. New vulnerabilities are found every day in applications, operating systems, and databases while older vulnerabilities remain exploitable. Add in the number of dashboards, alerts, and data points each information security tool provides and security teams find themselves swimming in oceans of data and unsure where to focus their energy. There is an urgent need to have a cohesive plan in place to cut through the noise and face these threats. Cybersecurity operations do not require expensive tools or large capital investments. There are ways to capture the necessary data. Teams protecting data and supporting HIPAA compliance can do this. All that's required is a plan--which author Eric Thompson provides in this book.

Bacteria In Daily Life This book is a result of an effort made by us towards making a contribution to the preservation and repair of original classic literature. In an attempt to preserve, improve and recreate the original content, we have worked towards: 1. Type-setting & Reformatting: The complete work has been re-designed via professional layout, formatting and type-setting tools to re-create the same edition with rich typography, graphics, high quality images, and table elements, giving our readers the feel of holding a 'fresh and newly' reprinted and/or revised edition, as opposed to other scanned & printed (Optical Character Recognition - OCR) reproductions. 2. Correction of imperfections: As the work was re-created from the scratch, therefore, it was vetted to rectify certain conventional norms with regard to typographical mistakes, hyphenations, punctuations, blurred images, missing content/pages, and/or other related subject matters, upon our consideration. Every attempt was made to rectify the imperfections related to omitted constructs in the original edition via other references. However, a few of such imperfections which could not be rectified due to intentional\unintentional omission of content in the original edition, were inherited and preserved from the original work to maintain the authenticity and construct, relevant to the work. We believe that this work holds historical, cultural and/or intellectual importance in the literary works community, therefore despite the oddities, we accounted the work for print as a part of our continuing effort towards preservation of literary work and our contribution towards the development of the society as a whole, driven by our beliefs. We are grateful to our readers for putting their faith in us and accepting our imperfections with regard to preservation of the historical content. HAPPY READING!

Objective-C is today's fastest growing programming language, at least in part due to the popularity of Apple's Mac, iPhone and iPad. Beginning Objective-C is for you if you have some programming experience, but you're new to the Objective-C programming language and you want a modern--and fast--way forwards to your own coding projects.  Beginning Objective-C offers you a modern programmer's perspective on Objective-C courtesy of two of the best iOS and Mac developers in the field today, and gets you programming to the best of your ability in this important language. It gets you rolling fast into the sound fundamentals and idioms of Objective-C on the Mac and iOS, in order to learn how best to construct your applications and libraries, making the best use of the tools it provides-- no matter what projects you plan to build. The book offers thorough introductions to the core tenets of the language itself and its primary toolkits: the Foundation and AppKit frameworks. Within its pages you will encounter a mine of information on many topics, including use of the file system and network APIs, concurrency and multi-core programming, the user interface system architecture, data modeling, and more.  You'll soon find yourself building a fairly complex Objective-C based application, and mastering the language ready for your own projects.  If you're new to programming altogether, then Apress has other Objective-C books for you such as our Learning and Absolute Beginner titles--otherwise, let your existing skills ramp you fast forwards in Objective-C with Beginning Objective-C so that you can start building your own applications quickly.

In this interesting book he notes his many experiences of the skills, activities and sometimes mysterious habits of many wild creatures. Many of the earliest natural history books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Home Farm Books are republishing many of these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.

An insightful look at the American environmental crisis and emerging solutions from the heartland to the coasts in the era of global climate change  Eminent ecologist Jeremy B. C. Jackson and award-winning journalist Steve Chapple traveled the length of the Mississippi River interviewing farmers, fishermen, scientists, and policymakers to better understand the mounting environmental problems ravaging the United States. Along their journey, which quickly expands to California, Florida, and New York, the pair uncovered surprising and profound connections between ecological systems and environmental crises across the country. Artfully weaving together independent research and engaging storytelling, Jackson and Chapple examine the looming threats from recent hurricanes and fires, industrial agriculture, river mismanagement, extreme weather events, drought, and rising sea levels that are pushing the country toward the breaking point of ecological and economic collapse.  Yet, despite these challenges, the authors provide optimistic and practical solutions for addressing these multidimensional issues to achieve greater environmental stability, human well-being, and future economic prosperity. With a passionate call to action, they look hopefully toward emerging and achievable solutions to preserve the country's future.

Chaparral shrubland ecosystems are an iconic feature of the California landscape, and a highly biodiverse yet highly flammable backdrop to some of the fastest growing urban areas in the United States. Chaparral-type ecosystems are a common element of all of the world's Mediterranean-type climate regions - of which California is one - yet there is little public appreciation of the intrinsic value and the ecosystem services that these landscapes provide. Valuing Chaparral is a compendium of contributions from experts in chaparral ecology and management, with a focus on the human relationship with chaparral ecosystems. Chapters cover a wide variety of subjects, ranging from biodiversity to ecosystem services like water provision, erosion control, carbon sequestration and recreation; from the history of human interactions with chaparral to current education and conservation efforts; and from chaparral restoration and management to scenarios of the future under changing climate, land use, and human population. Valuing Chaparral will be of interest to resource managers, the research community, policy makers, and the public who live and work in the chaparral dominated landscapes of California and other Mediterranean-type climate regions.

 C++語言是一種功能強大的電腦軟體語言，有關它的應用無所不在，從電腦的作業系統、大型應用軟體到日常生活中的汽車、智慧手機、家電等電器的控制軟體與應用軟體等，大部分都是以C++語言編寫的。學會C++語言程式設計的思考模式、技巧與方法，也可應用在學習其他的程式設計語言上，因此大專院校常以C++語言做為電腦基礎課程的重點項目。

 本書內容每章首先以實際範例來介紹該章的C++學習重點，接著以第二節的實際練習教導讀者如何學習與運用C++語言，在操作過程中若遇到不了解之處再參考第三節有關C++的各種重點整理，最後一節則對該章知識進行歸納總結。讓讀者在全新的教材結構中達到如下效果。

 (1) 創新習題：例題、習題、思考題與以往C++ 書籍的題目基本不同，注重實務應用與程式設計，更有利於讀者掌握和運用C++ 知識。

 (2) 親臨其境，易學易懂：每章均通過對實例的詳細講解引出知識重點和學習方法，並給出運行結果，有些例題還附上了測試記錄，讓讀者易學易懂。

 (3) 親身體驗，學用結合：每一章學完了第一節的例題後，馬上進入第二節親身體驗階段──獨立程式設計應用。應用中有問題時，再帶著問題參考第一節或第三節的知識，做到學用結合。

 (4) 有的放矢，邊用邊學：本書將C++ 的各項知識點和難點安排在每一章的第三節，目的是與第二節的題目配合起來，讓讀者有的放矢地學習C++ 知識，即用一點學一點，而不是一次性地學完某部分C++知識再去做題目。當讀者能夠編寫第二節習題的程式時，就已經將該部分的C++ 知識理解吸收了。

El presente ensayo se mueve en el 獺mbito fronterizo de diferentes disciplinas como: la geograf穩a, el urbanismo y la movilidad metropolitana, para tener una visi籀n amplia e integral del objeto de an獺lisis. El mismo, ni surge, ni tiene intenci籀n de ser una propuesta urban穩stica o de planificaci籀n cerrada o prefijada de antemano. Al contrario, nace con vocaci籀n de servir de palanca de cambio y est穩mulo de la discusi籀n para el planteamiento de nuevos paradigmas urban穩sticos, territoriales y de movilidad, teniendo como eje y com繳n denominador la red de ferrocarril convencional. La motivaci籀n del presente estudio es, por lo tanto, generar un debate p繳blico, abierto y participativo sobre la dicotom穩a existente entre una red ferroviaria convencional, progresivamente abandonada a su suerte, y una flamante L穩nea de Alta Velocidad que, tras m獺s de una d矇cada de promesas de inauguraci籀n e inversiones millonarias invertidas, lo 繳nico que ha provocado es el aislamiento ferroviario de Granada, en direcci籀n oeste, durante los 繳ltimos tres a簽os (2015-2018).

A comprehensive mathematical and computational modeling of CO2 Geosequestration and Compressed Air Energy StorageEnergy and environment are two interrelated issues of great concern to modern civilization. As the world population will soon reach eight billion, the demand for energy will dramatically increase, intensifying the use of fossil fuels. Utilization of fossil fuels is by far the largest anthropogenic source of CO2 emission into the earth's atmosphere. This unavoidable reality necessitates efforts to mitigate CO2 from indefi nitely being emitted in the atmosphere. CO2 geo-sequestration is currently considered to be a vital technology for this purpose. Meanwhile, and as fossil fuels will sooner or later be depleted, utilization of renewable energy resources is inevitable. Nowadays, wind and solar energy, being clean and sustainable, are gaining momentum. However, their availability is intermittent. This intermittent nature of solar and wind energy necessitates storing the produced energy at off-peak times for later use. Compressed air energy storage in subterranean caverns, aquifers and coal seams is currently considered to be a plausible technology for this purpose. CO2 geo-sequestration and compressed air energy storage are thus vital technologies for current and future energy strategy development. These technologies can be made safe and cost-effective by utilizing computational tools capable of simulating the involved multiphysical phenomena and processes. Computational modeling of such systems is challenging and resource-consuming. Meeting such a challenge constitutes the focal point of this book.This book addresses comprehensive theoretical and computational modeling aspects of CO2 geosequestration and compressed air energy storage. The book consists of 16 chapters authored by prominent researchers in these two fi elds. The authors of the book endeavoured to present years of innovative work, making it available for a wide range of readers, including geoscientists, poromechanists, applied mathematicians, computational geoscientists, geologists and reservoir engineers.

A guide to making scientific photographs for presentations, journal submissions, and covers, featuring step-by-step instructions and case studies, by an award-winning science photographer; illustrated in color throughout. One of the most powerful ways for scientists to document and communicate their work is through photography. Unfortunately, most scientists have little or no training in that craft. In this book, celebrated science photographer Felice Frankel offers a guide for creating science images that are both accurate and visually stunning. Picturing Science and Engineering provides detailed instructions for making science photographs using the DSLR camera, the flatbed scanner, and the phone camera. The book includes a series of step-by-step case studies, describing how final images were designed for cover submissions and other kinds of visualizations. Lavishly illustrated in color throughout, the book encourages the reader to learn by doing, following Frankel as she recreates the stages of discovery that lead to a good science visual. Frankel shows readers how to present their work with graphics--how to tell a visual story--and considers issues of image adjustment and enhancement. She describes how developing the right visual to express a concept not only helps make science accessible to nonspecialists, but also informs the science itself, helping scientists clarify their thinking. The book includes references to Frankel's online tutorials at the book's website--visual ""punctuations"" of this printed edition--along with how-to videos and other additional materials.Published with the generous support of Furthermore: a program of the J. M. Kaplan Fund.

Scientific advances have transformed the world. However, science can sometimes get things wrong, and at times, disastrously so. Understanding the basis for scientific claims and judging how much confidence we should place in them is essential for individual choice, societal debates, and development of public policy and laws. We must ask: what is the basis of scientific claims? How much confidence should we put in them? What is defined as science and what is not? This book synthesizes a working definition of science and its properties, as explained through the eyes of a practicing scientist, by integrating advances from philosophy, psychology, history, sociology, and anthropology into a holistic view. Crucial in our political climate, the book fights the myths of science often portrayed to the public. Written for a general audience, it also enables students to better grasp methodologies and helps professional scientists to articulate what they do and why.

	在本書中，MICHAEL C. FEATHERS提供了許多整套的策略，使讀者能夠更有效率地使用遺留程式碼，以及未經測試的遺留code base。這本書取材於作者為他知名的Object Mentor研討會所撰寫的內容。作者在指導時所提到的技巧，已經幫助數以百計的開發者、技術管理者以及測試人員，使他們的遺留系統維持在掌控之中。

	本書內容包括：
	☛了解軟體修改的機制：增加特性、修正bug、改善設計、調整性能。
	☛使遺留程式碼進入測試控制工具（test harness）。
	☛編寫測試來保護你免於引入新的問題。
	☛可用於任何語言或平台的技術──以Java、C++、C與C#為範例。
	☛正確分辨程式碼應該修改的地方。
	☛處理非物件導向的遺留系統。
	☛處理看來似乎沒有任何結構的應用程式。

	這本書也包含24個解依賴技術的目錄，可協助你讓程式的要素獨立，並且使變動更加安全。

This book not only discusses the important topics in the area of machine learning and combinatorial optimization, it also combines them into one. This was decisive for choosing the material to be included in the book and determining its order of presentation. Decision trees are a popular method of classification as well as of knowledge representation. At the same time, they are easy to implement as the building blocks of an ensemble of classifiers. Admittedly, however, the task of constructing a near-optimal decision tree is a very complex process. The good results typically achieved by the ant colony optimization algorithms when dealing with combinatorial optimization problems suggest the possibility of also using that approach for effectively constructing decision trees. The underlying rationale is that both problem classes can be presented as graphs. This fact leads to option of considering a larger spectrum of solutions than those based on the heuristic. Moreover, ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to advantage when building ensembles of classifiers.This book is a combination of a research monograph and a textbook. It can be used in graduate courses, but is also of interest to researchers, both specialists in machine learning and those applying machine learning methods to cope with problems from any field of R&D.

Biological evolution is a fact--but the many conflicting theories of evolution remain controversial even today. When Adaptation and Natural Selection was first published in 1966, it struck a powerful blow against those who argued for the concept of group selection--the idea that evolution acts to select entire species rather than individuals. Williams's famous work in favor of simple Darwinism over group selection has become a classic of science literature, valued for its thorough and convincing argument and its relevance to many fields outside of biology. Now with a new foreword by Richard Dawkins, Adaptation and Natural Selection is an essential text for understanding the nature of scientific debate.

One of the Great Lakes region's most precious natural resources is its fishery, with its intricate web of aquatic life, the environments it inhabits, and the people who use and enjoy these areas. The Great Lakes fishery supports not only an important commercial fishing industry but also tourism in eight different states and two countries, attracting millions of recreational anglers each year. As valuable as the fishery is, it is equally fragile. Since the 1950s, state, provincial, and federal agencies have coordinated efforts to manage the fishery and protect it from a range of threats, from the spread of invasive species to nutrient pollution to habitat destruction. Now in its fourth edition, The Life of the Lakes examines the complex portrait of the Great Lakes fishery, including the history of the fishery's exploitation and management, the current health of the Lakes, and the outlook for the future. Featuring more graphics, photos, and illustrations than ever, all printed in full color, the new edition of this engaging book is a perfect resource for general readers, teachers, and students looking for an easy-to-follow guide to the Great Lakes fishery. This book is published in collaboration with Michigan Sea Grant (www.michiganseagrant.org), a cooperative program of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.

This open access book focuses on the linear selection index (LSI) theory and its statistical properties. It addresses the single-stage LSI theory by assuming that economic weights are fixed and known - or fixed, but unknown - to predict the net genetic merit in the phenotypic, marker and genomic context. Further, it shows how to combine the LSI theory with the independent culling method to develop the multistage selection index theory. The final two chapters present simulation results and SAS and R codes, respectively, to estimate the parameters and make selections using some of the LSIs described. It is essential reading for plant quantitative geneticists, but is also a valuable resource for animal breeders.

This book reveals how a generative design process capitalizes on understanding humans in context to deliver appropriate innovation. A repertoire of design actions and output allows designers to work dynamically in order to create a cascade of new ideas and insights. The Design Matrix, a visual team tool, provides a prescriptive and descriptive guide enabling a range of users to work through a problem and also reflect on past decisions. Several case studies from prior industry collaborative projects show the complexities and tensions that can be tackled through the design process and matrix.Case studies include design and engineering development and production of an 8 Tesla MRI, biomedical projects, medical devices, and consumer products. Other cases with Ford Motor Company and Cognizant Technologies illustrate how using a human-centered design process can shift the business paradigm for new products, services, systems, and social innovations. Each story shows different and distinct aspects that span classic design and engineering problem solving to generative contextual processes which lead to innovative solutions. Describes a studio-based product development pedagogy so readers can understand through past examples how to operationalize their own design, engineering, and innovation processes;Provides specific stories that showcase details of the project work, the contextual insights, and proposed solutions as a result of applying tangible visualizations, collaborative work methods, and framing and reframing of the problem;Uses case studies to demonstrate how to use divergent and convergent design thinking and actions from multiple stages of the design process so this can lead to critical team integration and new contextual insights.

Introduction The purpose of this book is to teach you the fundamentals and mechanics of the C# programming language. Most books teach programming primarily using text. That's great for novels, but many of the important concepts of programming languages can best be understood through a combination of words, figures, and tables. Many of us think visually, and figures and tables can help clarify and crystallize our understanding of a concept. In several years of teaching programming languages, I have found that the pictures I drew on the whiteboards were the things that most quickly helped the students understand the concepts I was trying to convey. Illustrations alone, however, are not sufficient to explain a programming language and platform. The goal of this book is to find the best combination of words and illustrations to give you a thorough understanding of the language and to allow the book to serve as a reference resource as well. This book is written for anyone who wants an introduction to the C# programming language--from the novice to the seasoned programmer. For those just getting started in programming, I've included the basics. For seasoned programmers, the content is laid out succinctly, in a form that allows you to go directly to the information required without having to wade through oceans of words. For both sets of programmers, the content itself is presented graphically, in a form that should make the language easy to learn.

Another day without Test-Driven Development means more time wasted chasing bugs and watching your code deteriorate. You thought TDD was for someone else, but it's not! It's for you, the embedded C programmer. TDD helps you prevent defects and build software with a long useful life. This is the first book to teach the hows and whys of TDD for C programmers.TDD is a modern programming practice C developers need to know. It's a different way to program---unit tests are written in a tight feedback loop with the production code, assuring your code does what you think. You get valuable feedback every few minutes. You find mistakes before they become bugs. You get early warning of design problems. You get immediate notification of side effect defects. You get to spend more time adding valuable features to your product.James is one of the few experts in applying TDD to embedded C. With his 1.5 decades of training, coaching, and practicing TDD in C, C++, Java, and C# he will lead you from being a novice in TDD to using the techniques that few have mastered.This book is full of code written for embedded C programmers. You don't just see the end product, you see code and tests evolve. James leads you through the thought process and decisions made each step of the way. You'll learn techniques for test-driving code right nextto the hardware, and you'll learn design principles and how to apply them to C to keep your code clean and flexible.To run the examples in this book, you will need a C/C++ development environment on your machine, and the GNU GCC tool chain or Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ (some project conversion may be needed).

It's time to capitalize on your mastery of Cocoa with Pro Objective-C Design Patterns for iOS. You've developed apps that impressed and performed, and now you're ready to jump into development practices that will leave you with more effective, efficient, and professional level apps. This book is the element you need to make the jump from journeyman to master.  All too often, developers grind through building good apps on willpower and a vigorous focus on code development, leaving them unaware of and unable to benefit from the underlying structural and functional design patterns.  Pro Objective-C Design Patterns for iOS will teach you those design patterns that have always been present at some level in your code, but were never recognized, acknowledged, or fully utilized. Implementation of specific pattern approaches will prove their value to any developer working in the iOS application arena. You'll learn to master classic patterns like singleton, abstract factory, chain of responsibility, and observer. You'll also discover less well-known but useful patterns like memento, composite, command, and mediator.

This book focuses on light invariant bare hand gesture recognition while there is no restriction on the types of gestures. Observations and results have confirmed that this research work can be used to remotely control a robotic hand using hand gestures. The system developed here is also able to recognize hand gestures in different lighting conditions. The pre-processing is performed by developing an image-cropping algorithm that ensures only the area of interest is included in the segmented image. The segmented image is compared with a predefined gesture set which must be installed in the recognition system. These images are stored and feature vectors are extracted from them. These feature vectors are subsequently presented using an orientation histogram, which provides a view of the edges in the form of frequency. Thereby, if the same gesture is shown twice in different lighting intensities, both repetitions will map to the same gesture in the stored data. The mapping of the segmented image's orientation histogram is firstly done using the Euclidian distance method. Secondly, the supervised neural network is trained for the same, producing better recognition results.  An approach to controlling electro-mechanical robotic hands using dynamic hand gestures is also presented using a robot simulator. Such robotic hands have applications in commercial, military or emergency operations where human life cannot be risked. For such applications, an artificial robotic hand is required to perform real-time operations. This robotic hand should be able to move its fingers in the same manner as a human hand. For this purpose, hand geometry parameters are obtained using a webcam and also using KINECT. The parameter detection is direction invariant in both methods. Once the hand parameters are obtained, the fingers' angle information is obtained by performing a geometrical analysis. An artificial neural network is also implemented to calculate the angles. These two methods can be used with only one hand, either right or left. A separate method that is applicable to both hands simultaneously is also developed and fingers angles are calculated. The contents of this book will be useful for researchers and professional engineers working on robotic arm/hand systems.

This book highlights the role that both infrastructure and governance play in the context of resilience and adaptation to climate variability and change. Eleven case studies analyze in-depth impacts of extreme events in projects, basins and regions in the Arid Americas (Unites States and Mexico), Australia, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Nepal, Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey and South Africa. They discuss the importance of infrastructure (mainly reservoirs) in adaptation strategies, how planning and management aspects should improve in response to changing climatic, economic, social and environmental situations and what the management, institutional and financial challenges would be for their implementation. Governance aspects (policies, institutions and decision making) and technical and knowledge limitations are a substantial part of the analyses. The case studies argue that reservoirs are essential to build resilience contributing to adaptation to climate variability and change. However, that for them to be effective, they need to be planned and managed within a governance framework that considers long-term perspectives and multi-sector and multi-level actor needs and perspectives.

Through words and photographs, environmental scientist Gretchen C. Daily and photographer Charles J. Katz describe how one relict tree--the magnificent Ceiba pentandra in Sabalito, Costa Rica--carries physical and spiritual importance. The people in the town of Sabalito call the tree la ceiba, a term said to be derived from a Ta穩no word referring to a type of wood used for making canoes in the West Indies. Ceiba evokes times and places where people hollowed out the great cylindrical trunks and glided along languid rivers winding through lush tropical forest. Today the tree is known by different names in regions ranging from southern Mexico and the Caribbean to the southern edge of the Amazon Basin and in western Africa. The ceiba has survived what is probably the highest rate of tropical deforestation in the world. It is a legendary and vital tree in centuries-old forests in places like Costa Rica that were once almost completely forested (98 percent in the mid-twentieth century) and decades later have suffered devastating deforestation (34 percent by 1980). One Tree grew out of a conversation between photographer Chuck Katz and acclaimed ecologist Gretchen Daily about the relict tree--a single tree that remains standing in a pasture, for example, after the forest has been cleared from the land, and takes on iconic importance for the animals, plants, and people in the ecosystem. During a trip the authors took to Costa Rica, Katz focused his lens on the ceiba and a story was born. In descriptive language interwoven with scientific fact, Daily discusses the tree's historical and natural history and the ceiba species in general. She touches on the science of the Costa Rican rainforest and its deforestation and the cultural traditions, legends, and folklore of forests and relict trees. Katz's photographs of the massive tree and the village that takes care of it create an intimate work celebrating the visual and biological intricacies of trees.

The proposal that the impact of humanity on the planet has left a distinct footprint, even on the scale of geological time, has recently gained much ground. Global climate change, shifting global cycles of the weather, widespread pollution, radioactive fallout, plastic accumulation, species invasions, the mass extinction of species - these are just some of the many indicators that we will leave a lasting record in rock, the scientific basis for recognizing new time intervals in Earth's history. The ""Anthropocene,"" as the proposed new epoch has been named, is regularly in the news. Even with such robust evidence, the proposal to formally recognize our current time as the Anthropocene remains controversial both inside and outside the scholarly world, kindling intense debates. The reason is clear. The Anthropocene represents far more than just another interval of geologic time. Instead, the Anthropocene has emerged as a powerful new narrative, a concept through which age-old questions about the meaning of nature and even the nature of humanity are being revisited and radically revised. This Very Short Introduction explains the science behind the Anthropocene and the many proposals about when to mark its beginning: The nuclear tests of the 1950s? The beginnings of agriculture? The origins of humans as a species? Erle Ellis considers the many ways that the Anthropocene's ""evolving paradigm"" is reshaping the sciences, stimulating the humanities, and foregrounding the politics of life on a planet transformed by humans. The Anthropocene remains a work in progress. Is this the story of an unprecedented planetary disaster? Or of newfound wisdom and redemption? Ellis offers an insightful discussion of our role in shaping the planet, and how this will influence our future on many fronts. ABOUT THE SERIES:  The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.

Introduction ASP.NET is Microsoft's platform for developing web applications. Using ASP.NET, you can create- commerce shops, data-driven portal sites, and just about anything else you can find on the Internet. Best of all, you don't need to paste together a jumble of HTML and script code in order to program the Web. Instead, you can create full-scale web applications using nothing but code and a design tool such as Visual Studio 2008. The cost of all this innovation is the learning curve. To master ASP.NET, you need to learn how to use an advanced design tool (Visual Studio), a toolkit of objects (the .NET Framework), and an obje- oriented programming language (such as C# 2010). Taken together, these topics provide more than enough to overwhelm any first-time web developer. Beginning ASP.NET 4 in C# 2010 assumes you want to master ASP.NET, starting from the basics. Using this book, you'll build your knowledge until you understand the concepts, techniques, and best practices for writing sophisticated web applications. The journey is long, but it's also satisfying. At the end of the day, you'll find that ASP.NET allows you to tackle challenges that are simply out of reach on many other platforms. About This Book This book explores ASP.NET, which is a core part of Microsoft's .NET Framework. The .NET Framework is not a single application--it's actually a collection of technologies bundled into one marketing term.

Unlike other books on the modeling and analysis of experimental data, Design and Analysis of Experiments: Classical and Regression Approaches with SAS not only covers classical experimental design theory, it also explores regression approaches. Capitalizing on the availability of cutting-edge software, the author uses both manual methods and SAS programs to carry out analyses.The book presents most of the different designs covered in a typical experimental design course. It discusses the requirements for good experimentation, the completely randomized design, the use of orthogonal contrast to test hypotheses, and the model adequacy check. With an emphasis on two-factor factorial experiments, the author analyzes repeated measures as well as fixed, random, and mixed effects models. He also describes designs with randomization restrictions, before delving into the special cases of the 2k and 3k factorial designs, including fractional replication and confounding. In addition, the book covers response surfaces, balanced incomplete block and hierarchical designs, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and MANOVA. Fortifying the theory and computations with practical exercises and supplemental material, this distinctive text provides a modern, comprehensive treatment of experimental design and analysis.

This book is an introduction to both offensive and defensive techniques of cyberdeception. Unlike most books on cyberdeception, this book focuses on methods rather than detection. It treats cyberdeception techniques that are current, novel, and practical, and that go well beyond traditional honeypots. It contains features friendly for classroom use: (1) minimal use of programming details and mathematics, (2) modular chapters that can be covered in many orders, (3) exercises with each chapter, and (4) an extensive reference list.Cyberattacks have grown serious enough that understanding and using deception is essential to safe operation in cyberspace. The deception techniques covered are impersonation, delays, fakes, camouflage, false excuses, and social engineering. Special attention is devoted to cyberdeception in industrial control systems and within operating systems. This material is supported by a detailed discussion of how to plan deceptions and calculate their detectability and effectiveness. Some of the chapters provide further technical details of specific deception techniques and their application. Cyberdeception can be conducted ethically and efficiently when necessary by following a few basic principles. This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students, as well as computer professionals learning on their own. It will be especially useful for anyone who helps run important and essential computer systems such as critical-infrastructure and military systems.

C# 2010 offers powerful new features, and this book is the fastest path to mastering them--and the rest of C#--for both experienced C# programmers moving to C# 2010 and programmers moving to C# from another object-oriented language. Many books introduce C#, but very few also explain how to use it optimally with the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). This book teaches both core C# language concepts and how to wisely employ C# idioms and object-oriented design patterns to exploit the power of C# and the CLR. This book is both a rapid tutorial and a permanent reference. You'll quickly master C# syntax while learning how the CLR simplifies many programming tasks. You'll also learn best practices that ensure your code will be efficient, reusable, and robust. Why spend months or years discovering the best ways to design and code C# when this book will show you how to do things the right way from the start?  Comprehensively and concisely explains both C# 2008 and C# 2010 features  Focuses on the language itself and on how to use C# 2010 proficiently for all .NET application development  Concentrates on how C# features work and how to best use them for robust, high-performance code

This book focuses on central themes related to the conservation of bats. It details their response to land-use change and management practices, intensified urbanization and roost disturbance and loss. Increasing interactions between humans and bats as a result of hunting, disease relationships, occupation of human dwellings, and conflict over fruit crops are explored in depth. Finally, contributors highlight the roles that taxonomy, conservation networks and conservation psychology have to play in conserving this imperilled but vital taxon.With over 1300 species, bats are the second largest order of mammals, yet as the Anthropocene dawns, bat populations around the world are in decline. Greater understanding of the anthropogenic drivers of this decline and exploration of possible mitigation measures are urgently needed if we are to retain global bat diversity in the coming decades. This book brings together teams of international experts to provide a global review of current understanding and recommend directions for future research and mitigation.

	本書涉及廣泛領域，係因研究主題使然：中共運用貿易、投資、政治運作與軍事手段等不同程度作為，探索從能源到礦產，從土地到水源各種資源。因此，本書取名為《中共資源探尋牽動全球地緣政治》。儘管本書涵蓋層面甚廣，但並非無所不包，筆者並不逐一細究中共探索的礦產，或是與中共交手的各個國家，而是以幾 個代表性案例作為本書的鑽研主軸。另外，除非中國大陸內部所消 耗或生產的資源，直接衝擊中共海外資源的取得，否則本書不予探 討。這樣一來終究會將許多中國大陸內部對全球環境構成嚴重影響的活動排除在外，最值關注的是燃煤及其對全球氣候變遷的衝擊；相反地，中國大陸境內確保水源的作為(影響下游國家的流量與取水量)，通常符合本書對「資源探尋」的定義，因此列入探討。

Exploring C++ uses a series of self-directed lessons to divide C++ into bite-sized chunks that you can digest as rapidly as you can swallow them. The book assumes only a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, functions, expressions, statements) and requires no prior knowledge of C or any other particular language. It reduces the usually considerable complexity of C++.The included lessons allow you to learn by doing, as a participant of an interactive education session. You'll master each step in one sitting before you proceed to the next. Author Ray Lischner has designed questions to promote learning new material. And by responding to questions throughout the text, you'll be engaged every step of the way.

An insider account of how researchers unraveled the mystery of the thawing ArcticIn the 1990s, researchers in the Arctic noticed that floating summer sea ice had begun receding. This was accompanied by shifts in ocean circulation and unexpected changes in weather patterns throughout the world. The Arctic's perennially frozen ground, known as permafrost, was warming, and treeless tundra was being overtaken by shrubs. What was going on? Brave New Arctic is Mark Serreze's riveting firsthand account of how scientists from around the globe came together to find answers.In a sweeping tale of discovery spanning three decades, Serreze describes how puzzlement turned to concern and astonishment as researchers came to understand that the Arctic of old was quickly disappearing--with potentially devastating implications for the entire planet. Serreze is a world-renowned Arctic geographer and climatologist who has conducted fieldwork on ice caps, glaciers, sea ice, and tundra in the Canadian and Alaskan Arctic. In this must-read book, he blends invaluable insights from his own career with those of other pioneering scientists who, together, ushered in an exciting new age of Arctic exploration. Along the way, he accessibly describes the cutting-edge science that led to the alarming conclusion that the Arctic is rapidly thawing due to climate change, that humans are to blame, and that the global consequences are immense.A gripping scientific adventure story, Brave New Arctic shows how the Arctic's extraordinary transformation serves as a harbinger of things to come if we fail to meet the challenge posed by a warming Earth.-- ""Science""

On its own, C# simplifies network programming. Combine it with the precise instruction found in C# Network Programming, and you'll find that building network applications is easier and quicker than ever. This book helps newcomers get started with a look at the basics of network programming as they relate to C#, including the language's network classes, the Winsock interface, and DNS resolution. Spend as much time here as you need, then dig into the core topics of the network layer. You'll learn to make sockets connections via TCP and ""connectionless"" connections via UDP. You'll also discover just how much help C# gives you with some of your toughest chores, such as asynchronous socket programming, multithreading, and multicasting. Network-layer techniques are just a means to an end, of course, and so this book keeps going, providing a series of detailed application-layer programming examples that show you how to work with real protocols and real network environments to build and implement a variety of applications. Use SNMP to manage network devices, SMTP to communicate with remote mail servers, and HTTP to Web-enable your applications. And use classes native to C# to query and modify Active Directory entries. Rounding it all out is plenty of advanced coverage to push your C# network programming skills to the limit. For example, you'll learn two ways to share application methods across the network: using Web services and remoting. You'll also master the security features intrinsic to C# and .NET--features that stand to benefit all of your programming projects.

At the tips of our forks and on our dinner plates, a buffet of botanical dalliance awaits us. Sex and food are intimately intertwined, and this relationship is nowhere more evident than among the plants that sustain us. From lascivious legumes to horny hot peppers, most of humanity's calories and other nutrition come from seeds and fruits--the products of sex--or from flowers, the organs that make plant sex possible. Sex has also played an arm's-length role in delivering plant food to our stomachs, as human handmade evolution (plant breeding, or artificial selection) has turned wild species into domesticated staples.In Sex on the Kitchen Table, Norman C. Ellstrand takes us on a vegetable-laced tour of this entire sexual adventure. Starting with the love apple (otherwise known as the tomato) as a platform for understanding the kaleidoscopic ways that plants can engage in sex, successive chapters explore the sex lives of a range of food crops, including bananas, avocados, and beets, finally ending with genetically engineered squash--a controversial, virus-resistant vegetable created by a process that involves the most ancient form of sex. Peppered throughout are original illustrations and delicious recipes, from sweet and savory tomato pudding to banana puffed pancakes, avocado toast (of course), and both transgenic and non-GMO tacos.An eye-opening medley of serious science, culinary delights, and humor,  Sex on the Kitchen Table offers new insight into fornicating flowers, salacious squash, and what we owe to them. So as we sit down to dine and ready for that first bite, let us say a special grace for our vegetal vittles: let's thank sex for getting them to our kitchen table.

""For several years, Troy has been one of the key figures in the LINQ community. This comprehensive and well-written book serves as a compendium of the important wisdom and experience that he has accumulated through his years of studying LINQ and its uses."" -Charlie Calvert, Microsoft C# Community Program Manager  ""LINQ is changing the way we think about working with data and, in many ways, also about programming in general. LINQ to Objects Using C# 4.0 is a thorough reference that teaches how to simplify many day-to-day tasks with data. It also gives you the foundations that are necessary to understand a wide range of fascinating applications of LINQ that will, no doubt, continue to appear over the next few years."" -Tomas Petricek, Microsoft MVP and author of Real-World Functional Programming   Your Complete Example-Rich Guide to Using and Extending LINQ to Objects and PLINQ   Using LINQ to Objects, .NET developers can write queries over object collections with the same deep functionality that was once available only with SQL and relational databases. Now, for the first time, developers have a comprehensive and authoritative guide to applying LINQ to Objects in real-world software. Microsoft MVP Troy Magennis introduces state-of-the-art techniques for working with in-memory collections more elegantly and efficiently--and writing code that is exceptionally powerful, robust, and flexible.   Drawing on his unsurpassed experience coding software using LINQ and hosting the popular HookedOnLINQ.com site, Magennis presents timely, realistic solutions to a wide spectrum of development challenges, such as combining data from multiple sources, and achieving optimal performance with extremely large sets of data. You'll begin with brief quick-starts that walk you through LINQ to Objects' key features and query syntax. Next, you'll drill down to detailed techniques for applying and extending these features with C# 4.0 and C# 3.0--including code examples that reflect the realities of production development.  Coverage includes  - Writing basic LINQ queries with C#: filtering, projecting, and sorting data from in-memory collections - Mastering advanced techniques for grouping and joining data and understanding the performance implications of each technique - Taking full advantage of LINQ's standard query operators  - Creating custom query operators that follow best practices for coding patterns and error handling - Writing more fluent, readable LINQ queries with C# 4.0's language enhancements, including the new dynamic features - Combining LINQ with COM-Interop to access data sources such as Microsoft Excel - Using Parallel LINQ to Objects (PLINQ) to optimize queries for multi-core processors, and how to build custom parallel query operators - Integrating the best LINQ to Objects patterns into your day-to-day coding

Allow yourself to be taken back into deep geologic time when strange creatures roamed the Earth and Western North America looked completely unlike the modern landscape. Volcanic islands stretched from Mexico to Alaska, most of the Pacific Rim didn't exist yet, at least not as widespread dry land; terranes drifted from across the Pacific to dock on Western Americas' shores creating mountains and more volcanic activity. Landscapes were transposed north or south by thousands of kilometers along huge fault systems. Follow these events through paleogeographic maps that look like satellite views of ancient Earth. Accompanying text takes the reader into the science behind these maps and the geologic history that they portray. The maps and text unfold the complex geologic history of the region as never seen before. Winner of the 2021 John D. Haun Landmark Publication Award, AAPG-Rocky Mountain Section

We're a Team, You and I Technology authors write for a demanding group of people (I should know--I'm one of them). You know that building software solutions using any platform (e. g., . NET, Java, and COM) is extremely complicated and is highly specific to your department, company, client base, and subject matter. Perhaps you work in the electronic publishing industry, develop systems for the state or local government, or work at NASA or a branch of the military. Speaking for myself, I have developed children's educational software (Oregon Trail / Amazon Trail anyone?), various n-tier systems, and projects within the medical and financial industries. The chances are almost 100 percent that the code you write at your place of employment has little to do with the code I write at mine (unless we happened to work together previously!). Therefore, in this book, I have deliberately chosen to avoid creating examples that tie the example code to a specific industry or vein of programming. Given this, I explain C#, OOP, the CLR, and the . NET 4. 0 base class libraries using industry-agnostic examples. Rather than having every blessed example fill a grid with data, calculate payroll, or whatnot, I'll stick to subject matter everyone can relate to: automobiles (with some geometric structures and employee payroll systems thrown in for good measure). And that's where you come in. My job is to explain the C# programming language and the core aspects of the .

世界金融危機爆發，給全球經濟帶來了巨大的負面影響。美國現行的所有政策，正在不可避免地把全球帶入下一輪惡性通脹。由於許多國家都長期持有大量美元作為儲備貨幣，要應付金融危機，美國惟一的辦法是大印美鈔，相當於稀釋所有美元持有者的財富，充當美國經濟復甦的鋪路石。我們觀察2008以來的走勢不難看出，黃金行情一路上揚從850美元漲到了現在的1500美元，USDJPY從110日元跌倒現在80日元，美元兌人民幣匯率也從7.5元跌倒6.45元。與股票、期貨不同，外匯是一個24小時不停歇的國際市場，交投十分活躍，交易量十分巨大，一天有4萬億美元的成交量。這樣幾個特點不難看出外匯市場幾乎不可能被某個財團操縱，受某個國家經濟政策的影響也非常小，我們聽說過某某基金組織操縱了股市，甚至操縱了某地區的金融市場，還帶來了金融風暴嚴重夠過，但我們絕對沒聽說過某財團組織操縱外匯市場的傳聞，由此，我們得出了一個結論：外匯行情最適合用技術分析手段來把握。二十四小時盯盤，不停地做行情分析，頻繁地進行交易，你是個鐵人都會有倒下的時候，要知道炒外匯不是我們生活的全部，我們有權利去享受炒外匯以外的更多的生活樂趣，精通智慧交易系統程式編寫，善於使用智慧交易系統程式，就能為你爭取到更多的時間和精力。此書整理了一些針對MT4平臺的豐富圖文教程，不要被外界的傳聞嚇到自己，更不要自己勸退了自己，因為你來學習這門技術的目的是為了能更好的享受生活！因此，我們能很肯定的說，當你一輩子只需寫出三隻完美程式，就別再錯過你與本書的第一次邂逅。

As a Java developer and instructor, Jacquie Barker wrote her first book, Beginning Java Objects, to communicate her passionate belief that learning objects thoroughly is an essential first step in mastering an object-oriented programming language (OOPL). Since Beginning Java Objects was first published in November 2000, we've heard from countless readers who agree wholeheartedly! We were therefore delighted when Gary Cornell, the publisher of Apress, and Dominic Shakeshaft, Apress editorial director, approached us about producing a C# version of Beg- ning Java Objects. It's indeed true that basic object concepts are ""language neutral. "" What you'll learn conceptually about objects in Part One of this book, and about object modeling in Part Two, could apply equally well to any OOPL. But our goal for this book is twofold: not only do we want to teach you about objects and object modeling, but we also want to get you properly jump-started with the C# programming language by showing you how such concepts translate into C# syntax specifically. Hence, Beginning C# Objects was born! The first edition of Beginning C# Objects came out in the spring of 2004. Since that time, C# and the . NET platform have grown by leaps and bounds. Several new releases of the . NET Framework have come out, and many exciting new features have been added to the C# p- gramming language. This second edition of the book captures the ""latest and greatest"" of .

If you are serious about developing with the C# language, you need this book."" -Bill Craun, Principal Consultant, Ambassador Solutions, Inc.  ""More Effective C# is an opportunity to work beside Bill Wagner. Bill leverages his knowledge of C# and distills his expertise down to some very real advice about programming and designing applications that every serious Visual C# user should know. More Effective C# is one of those rare books that doesn't just regurgitate syntax, but teaches you how to use the C# language."" -Peter Ritchie, Microsoft MVP: Visual C#  ""More Effective C# is a great follow-up to Bill Wagner's previous book. The extensive C# 3.0 and LINQ coverage is extremely timely!"" -Tomas Restrepo, Microsoft MVP: Visual C++, .NET, and Biztalk Server  ""As one of the current designers of C#, it is rare that I learn something new about the language by reading a book. More Effective C# is a notable exception. Gently blending concrete code and deep insights, Bill Wagner frequently makes me look at C# in a fresh light-one that really makes it shine. More Effective C# is at the surface a collection of very useful guidelines. Look again. As you read through it, you'll find that you acquire more than just the individual pieces of advice; gradually you'll pick up on an approach to programming in C# that is thoughtful, beautiful, and deeply pleasant. While you can make your way willy-nilly through the individual guidelines, I do recommend reading the whole book-or at least not skipping over the chapter introductions before you dive into specific nuggets of advice. There's perspective and insight to be found there that in itself can be an important guide and inspiration for your future adventures in C#."" -Mads Torgersen, Program Manager, Visual C#, Microsoft  ""Bill Wagner has written an excellent book outlining the best practices for developers who work with the C# language. By authoring More Effective C#, he has again established himself as one of the most important voices in the C# community. Many of us already know how to use C#. What we need is advice on how to hone our skills so that we can become wiser programmers. There is no more sophisticated source of information on how to become a first-class C# developer than Bill Wagner's book. Bill is intelligent, thoughtful, experienced, and skillful. By applying the lessons from this book to your own code, you will find many ways to polish and improve the work that you produce."" -Charlie Calvert, Community Program Manager, Visual C#, Microsoft  In  More Effective C#,   Microsoft C# MVP and Regional Director Bill Wagner introduces fifty brand-new ways to write more efficient and more robust software. This all-new book follows the same format as Wagner's best-selling Effective C# (Addison-Wesley, 2005), providing clear, practical explanations, expert tips, and plenty of realistic code examples.  Wagner shows how to make the most of powerful innovations built into Microsoft's new C# 3.0 and .NET Framework 3.5, as well as advanced C# language capabilities not covered in his previous book. Drawing on his unsurpassed C# experience, the author reveals new best practices for working with LINQ, generics, metaprogramming, and many other features.

Windows Professional Foundation (WPF) offers amazing opportunities to .NET programmers in terms of the user interfaces they can deliver to their customers. But this significant technological advance comes with a steep learning curve, requiring the programmer to learn new classes, new syntax, and an entirely new approach to user interface development. Although WPF has been generally available since 2008, commercial take-up has been relatively slow, and the publicly available body of knowledge has been weak in terms of real-world examples and best-practice information. Using WPF Recipes in C# 2008, you'll find a simple and straightforward approach to solving the problems you face every day. Each solution contains a complete, working example that demonstrates how to make the best use of WPF. You can use the example as a template to solve your own problem or as a base on which to build a solution tailored to your specific needs. Packed with well-structured and documented solutions to a broad range of common WPF problems, this book, will be a valuable addition to any C# programmer's reference library. Examples included provide you with a rich source of information as you begin to learn and will be an invaluable quick-reference guide once you're a proficient WPF programmer. The emphasis on solving the day-to-day WPF problems that all programmers face frees you from needing to trawl through weighty programming tomes or sift through API documentation, allowing you to focus on the more interesting and innovative aspects of your project.

T he first computer programming book I read was entitled Programming Windows 3.0 by Charles Petzold. This was around the time when Microsoft Windows 3.0 (circa 1992) once and for all showed the industry that Microsoft was a company with a future. Writing code for Windows back then was complicated by many things: lack of documentation, 16-bit architecture, and the necessity of buying a compiler separate from the software development kit (SDK). Charles's book tied everything together and solved the problem of how to write a program for Windows. Now the problems are quite the opposite: we have too much documentation, we have 64-bit architectures, and everything including the kitchen sink is thrown into a development environment. Now we need to figure out what we actually need. We have too many options--too many ways to solve the same problem. What I am trying to do with this book is the same thing that Charles did for me when I first started out, and that was to help me figure out what I needed to write code. This book is about explaining the C# programming language in the context of solving pr- lems. C# has become a sophisticated programming language that can achieve many goals, but you are left wondering what techniques to use when. This book is here to answer your questions.

Fuel cells are clean and efficient energy conversion devices expected to be the next generation power source. During more than 17 decades of research and development, various types of fuel cells have been developed with a view to meet the different energy demands and application requirements. Scientists have devoted a great deal of time and effort to the development and commercialization of fuel cells important for our daily lives. However, abundant issues, ranging from mechanistic study to system integration, still need to be figured out before massive applications can be used. Miniaturization is one of the main bottlenecks for the advancement and further development of fuel cells. Thus, research on miniaturization of fuel cells as well as understanding the micro and nano structural effect on fuel cell performance are necessary and of great interest to solve the challenges ahead.In this book, internationally acclaimed experts illustrate how micro & nano engineering technology can be applied as a way of removing the restrictions presently faced by fuel cells both technically and theoretically. Through the twelve well designed chapters, major issues related to the miniaturization of different types of fuel cells are addressed. Theory focusing on micro and nano scale mechanics are outlined to better optimize the performance of fuel cells from laboratory scale to industrial scale. This book will be a good reference to those scientists and researchers interested in developing fuel cells through micro and nano scale engineering.

This book discusses the physics of the dynamics of ions in various ionically conducting materials, and applications including electrical energy generation and storage. The experimental techniques for measurements and characterization, molecular dynamics simulations, the theories of ion dynamics, and applications are all addressed by the authors, who are experts in their fields. The experimental techniques of measurement and characterization of dynamics of ions in glassy, crystalline, and liquid ionic conductors are introduced with the dual purpose of introducing the reader to the experimental activities of the field, and preparing the reader to understand the physical quantities derived from experiments. These experimental techniques include calorimetry, conductivity relaxation, nuclear magnetic resonance, light scattering, neutron scattering, and others. Methods of molecular dynamics simulations are introduced to teach the reader to utilize the technique for practical applications to specific problems. The results elucidate the dynamics of ions on some issues that are not accessible by experiments. The properties of ion dynamics in glassy, crystalline and liquid ionic conductors brought forth by experiments and simulations are shown to be universal, i.e. independent of physical and chemical structure of the ionic conductor as long as ion-ion interaction is the dominant factor. Moreover these universal properties of ion dynamics are shown to be isomorphic to other complex interacting systems including the large class of glass-forming materials with or without ionic conductivity.By covering the basic concepts, theories/models, experimental techniques and data, molecular dynamics simulations, and relating them together, Dynamics of Glassy, Crystalline and Liquid Ionic Conductors will be of great interest to many in basic and applied research areas from the broad and diverse communities of condensed matter physicists, chemists, materials scientists and engineers. The book also provides the fundamentals for an introduction to the field and it is written in such a way that can be used for teaching courses either at the undergraduate or graduate level in academic institutions.

The origin of life is one of the biggest unsolved scientific questions. This book deals with the formation and first steps of the chemical evolution of nucleic acids, including the chemical roots behind the origin of their components from the simplest sources in a geochemical context. Chemical evolution encompasses the chemical processes and interactions conducive to self-assembly and supramolecular organization, leading to an increase of complexity and the emergence of life. The book starts with a personal account of the pioneering work of Stanley Miller and Jeffrey Bada on the Chemistry of Origins of Life and how the development of organic chemistry beginning in the 19th century led to the emergence of the field of prebiotic chemistry, situated at the frontier between organic, geo- and biochemistry. It then continues reviewing in tutorial manner current central topics regarding the organization of nucleic acids: the origin of nucleobases and nucleosides, their phosphorylation and polymerization and ultimately, their self-assembly and supramolecular organization at the inception of life.

Although the basic statistical theory behind modern genetics is not very difficult, most statistical genetics papers are not easy to read for beginners in the field, and formulae quickly become very tedious to fit a particular area of application. Introduction to Statistical Methods in Modern Genetics distinguishes between the necessary and unnecessary complexity in a presentation designed for graduate-level statistics students. The author keeps derivations simple, but does so without losing the mathematical details. He also provides the required background in modern genetics for those looking forward to entering this arena. Along with some of the statistical tools important in genetics applications, students will learn: How a gene is found How scientists have separated the genetic and environmental aspects of a person's intelligence How genetics are used in agriculture to improve crops and domestic animals What a DNA fingerprint is and why there are controversies about it Although the author assumes students have a foundation in basic statistics, an appendix provides the necessary background beyond the elementary, including multinomial distributions, inference on frequency tables, and discriminant analysis. With clear explanations, a multitude of figures, and exercise sets in each chapter, this text forms an outstanding entr矇e into the rapidly expanding world of genetic data analysis.

The scenic images that Louisiana brings to mind -- moss-draped cypress, lush marshlands, alligators gliding through bayous, herons coasting across an open sky -- all spring from one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on the continent. This varied and inviting landscape gives rise to one of the state's many monikers, ""Sportsman's Paradise,"" which rings true whether you are boating on picturesque Lake Martin or bird-watching among the ancient live oaks of Lafitte Woods. From the precious maritime forests of Grand Isle to the steep contours of Tunica Hills, Louisiana's wild outdoors defines each region's sense of place and value.For nearly thirty years, The Nature Conservancy in Louisiana has served as a steward of these ecological riches, protecting and maintaining more than 285,000 acres of the state's land. Now, for the first time, readers can observe the vast array of flora and fauna found in these complex habitats in Louisiana Wild, with the awe-inspiring photography of C. C. Lockwood.After trekking and canoeing through more than sixty properties managed by The Nature Conservancy, Lockwood presents a vivid photo narrative that journeys from the little-known Copenhagen Hills, a prairie habitat with the largest variety of woody plants in Louisiana; to the swampland lake of Cypress Island, with its massive rookery of roseate spoonbills and great egrets; to over a dozen other sites that showcase Louisiana's distinct environs.With 220 color images, Louisiana Wild pays homage to the immeasurable impact of The Nature Conservancy's efforts and will delight anyone who calls Louisiana home.

This thesis describes one of the most precise experimental tests of Lorentz symmetry in electrodynamics by light-speed anisotropy measurement with an asymmetric optical ring cavity. The author aims to answer the fundamental, hypothetical debate on Lorentz symmetry in the Universe. He concludes that the symmetry is protected within an error of 10-15, which means providing one of the most stringent upper limits on the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. It introduces the following three keys which play an important role in achieving high-precision measurement: (1) a high-index element (silicon) interpolated into part of the light paths in the optical ring cavity, which improves sensitivity to the violation of the Lorentz symmetry, (2) double-pass configuration of the interferometer, which suppresses environmental noises, and (3) continuous data acquisition by rotating the optical ring cavity, which makes it possible to search for higher-order violations of Lorentz symmetry. In addition to those well-described keys, a comprehensive summary from theoretical formulations to experimental design details, data acquisition, and data analysis helps the reader follow up the experiments precisely.

This book describes challenges in the policy and practices of the various water sectors in the Philippines that have led to water conflicts. Such conflicts arise in the nature of rural-urban competition, trans-administrative boundary issues, and inconsistencies between customary and state rules, and even within state rules. Using inter-, multi- and trans-disciplinary approaches, and analysing from various scales - community, local and national governments - the book discusses policies and strategies needed towards achieving water security especially for the poor. Reflective of the complex and urgent water policy and governance issues in many developing countries, the book offers valuable lessons and insights to policy makers, water sector managers, planners and regulators as well as to academics, researchers and students.

Since that fateful day when the first wolf decided to stay close to human hunters, humans and their various animal companions have thrived far beyond nearly all wild species on earth. Tameness is the key trait in the domestication of cats, dogs, horses, cows, and other mammals, from rats to reindeer. Surprisingly, with selection for tameness comes a suite of seemingly unrelated alterations, including floppy ears, skeletal and coloration changes, and sex differences. It's a package deal known as the domestication syndrome, elements of which are also found in humans. Our highly social nature--one of the keys to our evolutionary success--is due to our own tameness. In Domesticated, Richard C. Francis weaves history and anthropology with cutting-edge ideas in genomics and evo devo to tell the story of how we domesticated the world, and ourselves in the process.

When .NET first appeared, it introduced a small avalanche of new technologies. There was a whole new way to write web applications (ASP.NET), a whole new way to connect to databases (ADO.NET), new typesafe languages (C# and VB .NET), and a managed runtime (the CLR). Not least among these new technologies was Windows Forms, a library of classes for building W- dows applications. Although Windows Forms is a mature and full-featured toolkit, it's hardwired to essential bits of Windows plumbing that haven't changed much in the past ten years. Most significantly, Windows Forms relies on the Windows API to create the visual appearance of standard user interface elements such as buttons, text boxes, check boxes, and so on. As a result, these ing- dients are essentially uncustomizable. For example, if you want to create a stylish glow button you need to create a custom c- trol and paint every aspect of the button (in all its different states) using a lower-level drawing model. Even worse, ordinary windows are carved up into distinct regions, with each control getting its own piece of real estate. As a result, there's no good way for the painting in one c- trol (for example, the glow effect behind a button) to spread into the area owned by another control. And don't even think about introducing animated effects such as spinning text, sh- mering buttons, shrinking windows, or live previews because you'll have to paint every detail by hand.

This gripping book brings back to life the events surrounding the internment of ten German Nuclear Scientists immediately after World War II. It is also an ""eye-witness"" account of the dawning of the nuclear age, with the dialogue and narrative spanning the period before, during and after atomic bombs were dropped on Japan at the end of the war. This pivotal historical episode is conveyed, along with the emotions as well as the facts, through drama, historical narrative, and photographs of the captive German nuclear scientists - who included Werner Heisenberg, Otto Hahn, and Max von Laue. The unique story that unfolds in the play is based on secretly recorded transcripts of the scientists' actual conversations at Farm Hall, together with related documents and photographs.

想要成為一名優秀的程式設計師，必須熟悉許多程式語言。在這麼多的程式語言中，大部分前輩會建議從Visual Basic、C++等主流語言學起，因為很多程式語言的語法是相似的，只要先將主流語言學好，想要學習其他程式語言，就可依樣畫葫蘆。本書編輯理念是希望帶領沒有程式基礎，或者僅有基本程式設計能力的讀者，從最基本的C++語法開始學習，內文中盡量以口語化的方式講解程式語言的觀念，並安排許多範例和馬上練習的題目，以期在實際撰寫程式碼的過程中，能了解程式語法的應用方法。學習了基本的程式語法以後，本書最後一章更引導讀者設計視窗程式專題，讓前面所學習到的基本程式技巧，可以實際應用到程式專題的製作上。

This is the first book in longitudinal categorical data analysis with parametric correlation models developed based on dynamic relationships among repeated categorical responses. This book is a natural generalization of the longitudinal binary data analysis to the multinomial data setup with more than two categories. Thus, unlike the existing books on cross-sectional categorical data analysis using log linear models, this book uses multinomial probability models both in cross-sectional and longitudinal setups. A theoretical foundation is provided for the analysis of univariate multinomial responses, by developing models systematically for the cases with no covariates as well as categorical covariates, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal setups. In the longitudinal setup, both stationary and non-stationary covariates are considered. These models have also been extended to the bivariate multinomial setup along with suitable covariates. For the inferences, the book uses the generalized quasi-likelihood as well as the exact likelihood approaches.The book is technically rigorous, and, it also presents illustrations of the statistical analysis of various real life data involving univariate multinomial responses both in cross-sectional and longitudinal setups. This book is written mainly for the graduate students and researchers in statistics and social sciences, among other applied statistics research areas. However, the rest of the book, specifically the chapters from 1 to 3, may also be used for a senior undergraduate course in statistics.

ASP.NET is Microsoft's platform for developing web applications. Using ASP.NET, you can create e-commerce shops, data-driven portal sites, and just about anything else you can find on the Internet. Best of all, you don't need to paste together a jumble of HTML and script code in order to program the Web. Instead, you can create full-scale web applications using nothing but code and a design tool such as Visual Studio 2008. The cost of all this innovation is the learning curve. To master ASP.NET, you need to learn how to use an advanced design tool (Visual Studio), a toolkit of objects (the .NET Framework), and an object-oriented programming language (such as C# 2008). Taken together, these topics provide more than enough to overwhelm any first-time web developer. Beginning ASP.NET 3.5 in C# 2008 assumes you want to master ASP.NET, starting from the basics. Using this book, you'll build your knowledge until you understand the concepts, te- niques, and best practices for writing sophisticated web applications. The journey is long, but it's also satisfying. At the end of the day, you'll find that ASP.NET allows you to tackle ch- lenges that are simply out of reach on many other platforms.

C++ is the language of choice for thousands of applications and millions of lines of code. With C++/CLI, developers can integrate existing C++ code into the .NET platform without rewriting their applications. This book explores the C++/CLI syntax, teaches how to mix native C++ and managed .NET code, and shows how to integrate C++ with Windows Forms, WPF (Avalon), and WCF (Indigo). Imagine taking a C++-based program you've been using for a decade and giving it a snazzy new interface using Windows Presentation Foundation. How about making your old business applications talk to your new ones using Windows Communication Foundation. C++/CLI makes this--and more--possible. C++/CLI in Action shows you how to bridge the gap between your existing C++ code and the .NET platform. C++/CLI in Action will help you if: You're hesitant to migrate to .NET because it means rewriting code in C# or VB.You have significant C++ expertise that you want to leverage in the .NET.You only need to use pieces of the .NET framework, such as Windows Forms or web services.There's no fluff here. Designed for readers who already know C++, this book starts by teaching the unique aspects of the C++/CLI language. After a quick tour through the basics, readers work through examples of integrating standard C++ into the .NET-based applications and building programs that mix C++ and .NET code for maximum performance and efficiency.

In 2002, I was giving a talk about sustainable furnishings and the impact of products on the environment. I finished the opening statement with the line ""One green deed spawns another."" It was meant to get the audience more broadly engaged in the welfare of our environment; the thought that a single effort might compel someone else to act seemed so simple. For fifteen years, I have closed many other talks with those same five words. If you polled 100 people about whether they wanted to preserve the planet for future generations, you'd get almost unanimously positive replies (there's always a contrarian in every crowd). Yet, here we are facing an ecological crisis without a united effort to combat it. Green deeds are being enacted minute by minute, daily, annually, and for lifetimes. Not only do we not get to witness all of them, we rarely get to hear about them. I decided I wanted to query some of my heroes who've inspired me over the years with their wisdom and commitment to greening our planet, about their one green deed. Sharing green deeds is not only inspiring, it is unifying; perhaps within this collection of engaging ideas are answers for the road ahead.This book is twofold in origin: the unusual path I followed to become environmentally active brought me in contact with some exceptional individuals. Some are as well-known as celebrities; others have flown under the radar. All of them have equally distinctive stories that have inspired me and influenced my philosophy on our relationship to our habitat and fellow species. This book is a compilation of these poignant moments with my environmental heroes and friends and their insightful ideas, and a tribute to the spirit of Earth's active stewards.

This book for the first time examines periodic motions to chaos in time-delay systems, which exist extensively in engineering. For a long time, the stability of time-delay systems at equilibrium has been of great interest from the Lyapunov theory-based methods, where one cannot achieve the ideal results. Thus, time-delay discretization in time-delay systems was used for the stability of these systems. In this volume, Dr. Luo presents an accurate method based on the finite Fourier series to determine periodic motions in nonlinear time-delay systems. The stability and bifurcation of periodic motions are determined by the time-delayed system of coefficients in the Fourier series and the method for nonlinear time-delay systems is equivalent to the Laplace transformation method for linear time-delay systems.

	工程師︰我已經拜讀了《Clean Code》，還有必要讀《Clean Architecture》嗎？
	架構師︰喔，你會做磚頭，那你會蓋房子嗎？

	將近10年的等待，全球知名作家Uncle Bob終於推出新作品《Clean Architecture》，由書名很容易就能猜到，這本書和《Clean Code》一定有關。沒錯，這兩本書是有些相同，但又有很大的不同。相同之處在於，這兩本書都是在教導軟體工程師如何正確開發出好的軟體，甚至兩本書提到的原則名稱有些還是相同的。不同之處在於，即便是相同的原則，但在不同層次上使用時，要注意的地方截然不同。

	總結來說，好的軟體系統始於整潔的程式碼（clean code），但光是這樣還不夠。也就是說，如果磚塊做得不好，那麼建築物的架構也就不重要了。但就另一方面來說，你也能用精心製作的磚塊來製造大量的垃圾，這本書就是要避免你製造垃圾。

	因此，除了閱讀《Clean Code》之外，你還需要閱讀《Clean Architecture》！

	再次地，Robert C. Martin以大師強而有力的口吻，極具說服力的文字來撰寫這本書，透過這本書教您如何建構好軟體的架構，釐清什麼是架構，以及認清獨立部署和獨立開發的重要性。如果您想開發的是企業級的軟體，那就千萬不可錯過這本書。

	本書將徹底顛覆您的許多觀點，例如微服務是個架構嗎？C語言沒有多型嗎（多型是物件導向發明的嗎）？C語言和C++的封裝相比，誰比較完美？軟體是數學還是科學？什麼是測試的本質？你應該使用框架嗎？關聯式資料庫為何會流行，是否已日暮途窮了呢？你可以先試著回答這些問題，然後在閱讀本書之後，再次審思這些問題，相信大多數的人，要答對一半都很困難。

	如果您自許成為一位專業的軟體工程師，強烈建議您，一定要好好詳讀這本書。

Allow yourself to be taken back into deep geologic time when strange creatures roamed the Earth and Western North America looked completely unlike the modern landscape. Volcanic islands stretched from Mexico to Alaska, most of the Pacific Rim didn't exist yet, at least not as widespread dry land; terranes drifted from across the Pacific to dock on Western Americas' shores creating mountains and more volcanic activity. Landscapes were transposed north or south by thousands of kilometers along huge fault systems. Follow these events through paleogeographic maps that look like satellite views of ancient Earth. Accompanying text takes the reader into the science behind these maps and the geologic history that they portray. The maps and text unfold the complex geologic history of the region as never seen before. Winner of the 2021 John D. Haun Landmark Publication Award, AAPG-Rocky Mountain Section

The history of American watchmaking is a microcosm of the history of American manufacturing. It is at its heart a story of the factory system producing interchangeable parts on automatic machinery. More broadly its rise and fall mirror that of the factory system as a whole. By embracing that system watch companies were able to create affordable watches for the newly established middle class and create good jobs for millions of men and women across the country. Because of competition within the industry watchmaking underwent numerous innovations including railroad standards, dollar watches, and the rise of the wristwatch. Michael Harrold's ""primer of watch history"" brings together the previously scattered and fragmented history of the American watchmaking industry. By incorporating the histories of companies and innovations in watch design, Harrold provides a comprehensive background for the rise and fall of American watchmaking, illustrated by photographs, charts, tables, graphs, and schematics. Included are appendices with a list and timeline of American watch companies and a serial number chart.

當我們在學習各種語言的過程中，絕對不會只學習文法與單字，還必須透過實際的會話和書寫練習，才能真正達到學習的目的。學習程式語言的過程也是如此。學習者必須先學會各種關鍵字與函式的用法與敘述式，若是沒有這些基礎知識，絕對無法成功地編寫程式。也因為如此，大部分的程式語言教材都有一個通病。就是只有在解說程式的語法結構時，才會出現幾行程式碼，而沒有能夠實際編譯並執行的『完整程式』。從這樣的教材很難指望能讓讀者學會編寫『能夠活用的程式』，事實上，也有很多讀者因此對於學習程式語言感到枯燥乏味。這就好像知道英文的單字與文法，卻沒辦法實際寫英文書信和會話一樣。只憑著斷片的語法知識，也沒有辦法實際編寫程式。本書以超過300多個圖解和多達近400個的實例，詳解C語言程式設計的入門和實作知識，從C的語法、變數、選擇、迴圈、陣列、函式、指標、結構、共同空間、檔案處理、二元樹、線性清單、函式庫等等，是自學教用都合適的教材。本書特色■ 榮獲日本工學教育協會優良著作獎■ 解說淺易，老師易教、學生易學，使用者皆受惠■ 範例解說各重要主題重點，學習最完整紮實■ 貼切圖解釐清觀念■ 練習問題累積功力■ 重要訊息、特別說明補充相關資訊■ 雙色印刷精美編排閱讀最舒適

""This book really demonstrates Bill's strengths as a writer and programmer. In a very short amount of time, he is able to present an issue, fix it and conclude it; each chapter is tight, succinct, and to the point."" --Josh Holmes, Independent Contractor ""The book provides a good introduction to the C# language elements from a pragmatic point of view, identifying best practices along the way, and following a clear and logical progression from the basic syntax to creating components to improving your code writing skills. Since each topic is covered in short entries, it is very easy to read and you'll quickly realize the benefits of the book."" --Tomas Restrepo, Microsoft MVP ""The book covers the basics well, especially with respect to the decisions needed when deriving classes from System.Object. It is easy to read with examples that are clear, concise and solid. I think it will bring good value to most readers."" --Rob Steel, Central Region Integration COE & Lead Architect, Microsoft ""Effective C# provides the C# developer with the tools they need to rapidly grow their experience in Visual C# 2003 while also providing insight into the many improvements to the language that will be hitting a desktop near you in the form of Visual C# 2005."" --Doug Holland, Precision Objects ""Part of the point of the .NET Framework--and the C# Language, in particular--is to let the developer focus solving customer problems and deliver product, rather than spending hours (or even weeks) writing plumbing code. Bill Wagner's Effective C#, not only shows you what's going on behind the scenes, but shows you how to take advantage of particular C# code constructs. Written in a dispassionate style that focuses on the facts--and just the facts--of writing effective C# code, Wagner's book drills down into practices that will let you write C# applications and components that are easier to maintain as well as faster to run. I'm recommending Effective C# to all students of my .NET BootCamp and other C#-related courses."" --Richard Hale Shaw, www.RichardHaleShawGroup.com  C#'s resemblances to C++, Java, and C make it easier to learn, but there's a downside: C# programmers often continue to use older techniques when far better alternatives are available. In Effective C#, respected .NET expert Bill Wagner identifies fifty ways you can start leveraging the full power of C# in order to write faster, more efficient, and more reliable software. Effective C# follows the format that made Effective C++ (Addison-Wesley, 1998) and Effective Java (Addison-Wesley, 2001) indispensable to hundreds of thousands of developers: clear, practical explanations, expert tips, and plenty of realistic code examples. Drawing on his unsurpassed C# experience, Wagner addresses everything from value types to assemblies, exceptions to reflection. Along the way, he shows exactly how to avoid dozens of common C# performance and reliability pitfalls. You'll learn how to:    Use both types of C# constants for efficiency and maintainability, see item 2   Use immutable data types to eliminate unnecessary error checking, see item 7   Avoid the C# function that'll practically always get you in trouble, see item 10   Minimize garbage collection, boxing, and unboxing, see items 16 and 17

In paperback for the first time, this compact volume presents quantum mechanics for the general reader. It offers a lucid description of the intellectual challenges and disagreements in the study of the behavior of atomic and sub-atomic particles--a field that has completely changed our view of the physical world, but that is still the subject of unresolved debate about its own fundamental interpretation. The work is accessible to those with no background in higher mathematics, but will also interest readers who have a more specialized knowledge of scientific topics. The author has spent most of his working life as a theoretical elementary particle physicist and from 1968 to 1979 was Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge. In 1979 he resigned to train for the ministry of the Church of England, and he is now an ordained priest. Here he describes a theory that has been spectacularly successful in predicting the behavior of objects the size of atoms and smaller but that has aroused conflicting views about the nature of reality and the degree of independence between the world around us and ourselves as observers.

A cold climate is no excuse for a dull, colorless garden. The key is knowing the right plants that will survive and thrive in even the chilliest environments. Who better to guide gardeners than an expert from the far north? Award-winning designer and Alaska gardener Brenda Adams has spent decades searching for exceptional plants that flourish in wintery climates. In Cool Plants for Cold Climates, she presents vivid and detailed portraits of the best and most beautiful of the bunch.  When Adams moved from the warm Southwest to Alaska, she found herself in a different gardening world, with few guides on how to approach this new ecosystem. Now, more than twenty-five years later, she shares the secrets gained from her years of gardening experiments as well as bountiful advice from friends and local nurseries. She explains how to evaluate a plant, balancing its artistic attributes with its more utilitarian ones, as well as how to evaluate your space and soil. Adams then takes you into the nursery, offering guidance on how to pick the best of the best. Finally, she offers a detailed look at a wide variety of wonderful plants, highlighting those that offer overall beauty, are especially easy to care for, and solidly hardy. With more than three hundred vivid pictures of both individual plants and full gardens, Adams proves that there is a bounty of plants, in a rainbow of colors, waiting to brighten up your space.

Despite its highly adaptable and flexible nature, C++ is also one of the more complex programming languages to learn. Once mastered, however, it can help you organize and process information with amazing efficiency and quickness.  The C++ Cookbook will make your path to mastery much shorter. This practical, problem-solving guide is ideal if you're an engineer, programmer, or researcher writing an application for one of the legions of platforms on which C++ runs. The algorithms provided in C++ Cookbook will jump-start your development by giving you some basic building blocks that you don't have to develop on your own.   Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you're likely encounter--whether you've been programming in C++ for years or you're relatively new to the language. Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for: Reading the contents of a directory Creating a singleton class Date and time parsing/arithmetic String and text manipulation Working with files Parsing XML Using the standard containers  Typical of O'Reilly's ""Cookbook"" series, C++ Cookbook is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply not to hypothetical situations, but those that you're likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the ""Cookbook"" series can attest to. This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.

This is the first of two volumes introducing structural and continuum mechanics in a comprehensive and consistent way. The current book presents all theoretical developments both in text and by means of an extensive set of figures. This same approach is used in the many examples, drawings and problems. Both formal and intuitive (engineering) arguments are used in parallel to derive the principles used, for instance in bending moment diagrams and shear force diagrams. A very important aspect of this book is the straightforward and consistent sign convention, based on the stress definitions of continuum mechanics. The book is suitable for self-education.

 A book that takes you through and beyond your doctoral studies. It will be a valuable reference throughout your working life.Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors pass on invaluable advice by answering such questions as: Do I want to do a doctorate?How should I choose which doctorate and where to study?How do I achieve my doctorate?What career opportunities exist once I've completed my doctorate?What is the role of networking, leadership and reputation in building my career?How do I go about mentoring the next generation?What do I do when things don't go to plan?This practical guide helps you to determine your best answer to all these questions and more. The authors not only discuss how to become a success but also how to keep success going, beginning with the choice to do a doctorate (or not) and what to expect, through how to get the best from student-supervisor interaction, the value of networking, the process of publication, how to choose between a career in academia or industry, while achieving work-life balance.The authors' own thoughts are enriched by the life experiences of many colleagues and prominent individuals who have achieved success and recognition: the book contains inspirational quotes from established figures in academia and industry. They reflect on career options, what leads to a successful career, and how to make conscious career choices instead of letting things happen and hoping for the best. This ranges from avoiding common pitfalls--such as squandering your reputation--to developing that all-important energy: your personal passion. A Doctorate and Beyond will be an extra difference in making the most of the best times and will support you when the going gets tough. If you are contemplating doctoral studies in engineering or the physical sciences, or have a doctorate and are seeking career guidance, this book will change the way you think about life.For further discussion and information about the book please see the blog/forum hosted by the authors at http: //adoctorateandbeyond.com/

If we've done our job well--and, let's be honest, if we're lucky--you'll read to the end of this description. Most likely, however, you won't. Somewhere in the middle of the next paragraph, your mind will wander off. Minds wander. That's just how it is.  That may be bad news for me, but is it bad news for people in general? Does the fact that as much as fifty percent of our waking hours find us failing to focus on the task at hand represent a problem? Michael Corballis doesn't think so, and with The Wandering Mind, he shows us why, rehabilitating woolgathering and revealing its incredibly useful effects. Drawing on the latest research from cognitive science and evolutionary biology, Corballis shows us how mind-wandering not only frees us from moment-to-moment drudgery, but also from the limitations of our immediate selves. Mind-wandering strengthens our imagination, fueling the flights of invention, storytelling, and empathy that underlie our shared humanity; furthermore, he explains, our tendency to wander back and forth through the timeline of our lives is fundamental to our very sense of ourselves as coherent, continuing personalities.  Full of unusual examples and surprising discoveries, The Wandering Mind mounts a vigorous defense of inattention---even as it never fails to hold the reader's.

Traditionally, genetics laboratory exercises at the university level focus on mono- and dihybrid crosses and phenotypic analysis--exercises under traditional time, materials, and process constraints. Lately, molecular techniques such as gene cloning, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and bioinformatics are being included in many teaching laboratories--where affordable. Human chromosome analysis, when present at all, has often been restricted to simple identification of chromosomes by number, through the usual ""cut-and-paste"" method. Although several online karyotyping (chromosome identification) programs have become available, they are not meaningful for studying the dynamics of the chromosome system, nor do they help students understand genetics as a discipline. The software that accompanies this book has been shown to be an ideal tool for learning about genetics, which requires a combination of understanding, conceptualization, and practical experience.

In the three years since Microsoft made C# available, there have been lots of tweaks to the language. That's because C# is not only essential for making .NET work, it's a big way for Microsoft to attract millions of Java, C and C++ developers to the platform. And C# has definitely made some inroads. Because of its popularity among developers, the language received standardization from ECMA International, making it possible to port C# applications to other platforms. To bolster its appeal, C# 2.0 has undergone some key changes as part of Visual Studio 2005 that will make development with .NET quicker and easier.That's precisely what Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook allows you to do. There are some great new features in C# and this unique ""all lab, no lecture"" guide covers them all with 50 hands-on projects. Each project explores a new feature, with emphasis on changes that increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and add functionality to applications.C#'s component-based design combines the productivity of Microsoft's popular Visual Basic with the raw power of C++ for web-based applications. Many reviewers note a similarity between C# and Java--in fact, a new feature that took the Java development team five years to incorporate into Java is now available in C# 2.0. Called ""generics"", this feature enables developers to reuse and customize their existing code, so they can dramatically cut down the time it takes to develop new applications.Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook is full of no-nonsense code without the usual page-filling commentary. You'll find suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, plus practical notes and warnings. The book also tells developers how to acquire, install and configure Visual Studio 2005. Are you a coder to the core? Learn what C# 2.0 can do for you now.

Although most people have some knowledge of the essential structure of the Solar System, few are familiar with the large and varied array of objects that travel with and between the planets in their journeys around the Sun. Imaging techniques from Earth continue to improve, while missions such as Voyager, Galileo and the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded many excellent images. Most significantly of all, several missions in recent years have shown a huge diversity of objects in close-up for the first time. The book will take advantage of the rich pool of images that is available, to tell a story of the Solar System that has not been told before. Smaller Bodies will be a collection of approximately 72 stunning images, all from the public domain but not hitherto gathered into a coherent collection, with supporting text and graphics. Each main image will be accompanied by a graphic showing the location in the Solar System of the featured object. All of these graphics will be based in a simple template providing a simple representation of the Solar System. Text will not be extensive, allowing page design to have a high priority, and will be of three kinds. 'Main text' (approximately 200 words) will provide stimulating introduction and some key ideas. Text headed 'The object(s)' (25-75 words) will provide a brief description of featured objects. Text headed 'The image' (25-75 words) will provide information on the source of the image and some brief technical information where required (such as in describing use of false color).  The book is intended for anybody who lives in solar orbit and takes a general interest in the solar neighborhood.

作者警語：
各位親愛的讀者，如果沒有合格的鯨、鯊、魷魚、龍蝦
或其他受過訓練的海洋專家，從旁協助，
請不要在家中嘗試書中的行為。

 從雄藍鯨充滿靈性的歌聲，到雄船蛸可以割捨的附肢，
 我以前完全不知道海洋裡的性生活，
 竟然可以這麼有創意；有時甚至可以說是怪異。
 《海裡的那檔子事》是一本非常逗趣、滑稽的書，
 而且還是從一個清新的角度，
 來描繪海面下神奇的生物多樣性。
 —— Sir Richard Branson，維珍集團創辦人

 性與海，兩者皆是深不見底的謎團。
 加起來，卻成就了一段爆炸性的精采奇譚。
 —— Paul Greenberg，暢銷作家

 海洋動物怎樣辦那檔子事，攸關重大：
 石斑魚最愛舉辦盛大的滿月性派對
 藍頭魚每天要來一百五十次快閃式性愛
 滑銀漢魚的五十道陰影，比格雷的更詭異
 拖鞋螺喜歡疊羅漢，打造情人摩天樓
 龐大的露脊鯨憋著氣，上演3P戲碼……

 辦那檔子事，也是一種裝備競賽：
 在海裡，尿液是強力春藥
 雌龍蝦就靠這一味，降服心上人
 介形蟲（種子蝦）是攜帶兩把長槍的雙槍俠
 船蛸擁有一根可分離、可發射的那話兒
 而鯨的陰道盤繞彎曲得非常厲害
 精子顯然需要良好的自動導航裝置……

 在洶湧波濤的海面下，隨時都在上演「生」之戲碼
 瑪樂．哈德特帶著幽默機智與科學家的嚴謹
 向我們介紹了鹹濕又狂野的海洋動物性生活
 引領我們應如何把對於性趣的好奇
 轉化為讓海洋生物更加豐沛的力量。

 將近三十億人口倚賴魚類，做為蛋白質的主要攝取來源，
 而其中半數魚類又來自海洋。
 要餵飽這麼多張嘴，每年都需要大量的魚兒成功繁衍小寶寶。
 ……
 不論是發現全新的抗癌藥物、餵飽日增的人口、或刺激經濟，
 我們都需要仰賴豐沛的海洋生物；
 而那種程度的豐沛，需要很多、很多的性愛。
 沒有成功的海洋性愛，我們就完了！
 這也是為什麼，瞭解海面下怎麼辦那檔子事，
 對於住在陸地上的我們，事關重大。
 —— 摘自本書前言〈讓魚鰭打溼吧〉

 消費者必須支持「性友善」海鮮
 （我們的作為不能損害牠們的性成就），
 必須像非營利組織「魚類的未來」所說的，
 要求「履歷魚」或是「自備身世」的魚，
 自備「如何從水中來到餐盤的資訊」，
 譬如魚如何被捕、於何處被捕、何時被捕。
 ……
 鯊魚去鰭以供應這個市場的過程，
 堪稱最浪費又醜惡的捕撈活動之一，
 只見漁民將甲板上的鯊魚的鰭割下來，
 然後就把這些還活著的動物扔下船，
 讓牠們流血到死，
 或是因為沒有魚鰭，無法游泳而活活溺死。
 —— 摘自本書第 8 章〈升高性欲〉

Effective C++ 3/e is a complete update of Effective C++ and Effective C++ 2/e . Like its predecessors, 3/e has 55 guidelines which contain better, more effective ways to write code, backed by specific examples. The second edition published in 1997, and was basically a face-lift of the first edition, keeping most of the same elements, and seven years later is still selling well. Now, Meyers has dramatically rejuvenated the material, including more than 30% brand-new material. Meyers began this edition by asking himself, ""What are the 55 most important pieces of advice for practicing C++ programmers in 2005?"" He also asked thousands of past users of his books this same question. This resulted in a completely new book. New material includes use of UML notation, thread safety, exception safety, design patterns, and templates. Any older material has been revitalized to reflect new ideas and strides in C++ development.

《p53：破解癌症密碼的基因》

	p53基因的發現與研究經過，不僅標記了癌症研究的重要里程，
	更見證了研究人員一路上追根究柢、永不言棄的精神

	我們每個人的DNA中都藏匿著一個卓越的基因，它身負著保護我們「免受癌症侵擾」的重責大任。

	這個歷史上受到最廣泛研究的基因簡稱「p53」，會持續篩檢所有細胞，確保它們在不出錯的情況下成長與分裂。若是過程中有任何細胞在複製DNA時出了錯，p53就會按下暫停鍵，阻止它繼續運作，接著召集維修小組進行修護，再讓此細胞繼續分裂。如果錯誤無法修復，且「擾亂細胞」失控增長並造成威脅，p53就會命令細胞進行自我毀滅。只要p53沒有受損、能夠正常運作，癌症自然不會發生。

	本書講述醫學界發現此基因的故事，讓我們知道當細胞癌化時究竟發生了什麼事。經由關鍵研究學者現身說法，本書揭開了追求科學知識的迷人之處，以及尋求新式療法的過程中，研究人員所歷經的種種波折與磨難：為了搶先公布成果彼此競爭、菸草公司與不肖科學家串通企圖模糊吸菸與肺癌的關聯、研發出癌症新藥卻因政策與資金問題無法進入臨床測試……。隨著現今即將走入針對個人症狀量身治療癌症的時代，p53依然處在此領域的尖端地位。

	本書中所提到的科學發現，不僅說明了人類在癌症研究上的最新進展，也讓人能夠期待在不久的將來，癌症這個影響全球超過三分之一人口的疾病，將不再是令人聞之色變、無可挽救的絕症。

This field guide introduces the complex history and ecology of Illinois' largest natural landscape state park. On its west side, the 8000-acre landscape is bounded by the Illinois River near its confluence with the Mississippi. Protecting one of the state's few unglaciated regions, the resulting rugged topography exposes ancient geology and supports a diversity of forests and prairies.  Founded in 1932, using local and state contributions, the park infrastructure was established by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It includes many amenities including a lodge of classic design, cabins, campgrounds, group camps, and equestrian and boating facilities. Its drives and trails invite exploration of a variety of habitats in all seasons. Checklists of organisms cover about 461 species of vascular plants, including 57 species of trees and shrubs. Animal observers have counted nearly 230 species of birds and about 59 species of amphibians and reptiles. At least 46 species of mammals may be expected to occur in the park. Adding to the guide's utility are color maps, graphs, and 59 color photographs of the park's features.

Password sniffing, spoofing, buffer overflows, and denial of service: these are only a few of the attacks on today's computer systems and networks. At the root of this epidemic is poorly written, poorly tested, and insecure code that puts everyone at risk. Clearly, today's developers need help figuring out how to write code that attackers won't be able to exploit. But writing such code is surprisingly difficult.Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++ is an important new resource for developers serious about writing secure code. It contains a wealth of solutions to problems faced by those who care about the security of their applications. It covers a wide range of topics, including safe initialization, access control, input validation, symmetric and public key cryptography, cryptographic hashes and MACs, authentication and key exchange, PKI, random numbers, and anti-tampering. The rich set of code samples provided in the book's more than 200 recipes will help programmers secure the C and C++ programs they write for both Unix(R) (including Linux(R)) and Windows(R) environments. Readers will learn: How to avoid common programming errors, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, and format string problems How to properly SSL-enable applications How to create secure channels for client-server communication without SSL How to integrate Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) into applications Best practices for using cryptography properly Techniques and strategies for properly validating input to programs How to launch programs securely How to use file access mechanisms properly Techniques for protecting applications from reverse engineering The book's web site supplements the book by providing a place to post new recipes, including those written in additional languages like Perl, Java, and Python. Monthly prizes will reward the best recipes submitted by readers.Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++ is destined to become an essential part of any developer's library, a code companion developers will turn to again and again as they seek to protect their systems from attackers and reduce the risks they face in today's dangerous world.

作者警語：
各位親愛的讀者，如果沒有合格的鯨、鯊、魷魚、龍蝦
或其他受過訓練的海洋專家，從旁協助，
請不要在家中嘗試書中的行為。

 從雄藍鯨充滿靈性的歌聲，到雄船蛸可以割捨的附肢，
 我以前完全不知道海洋裡的性生活，
 竟然可以這麼有創意；有時甚至可以說是怪異。
 《海裡的那檔子事》是一本非常逗趣、滑稽的書，
 而且還是從一個清新的角度，
 來描繪海面下神奇的生物多樣性。
 —— Sir Richard Branson，維珍集團創辦人

 性與海，兩者皆是深不見底的謎團。
 加起來，卻成就了一段爆炸性的精采奇譚。
 —— Paul Greenberg，暢銷作家

 海洋動物怎樣辦那檔子事，攸關重大：
 石斑魚最愛舉辦盛大的滿月性派對
 藍頭魚每天要來一百五十次快閃式性愛
 滑銀漢魚的五十道陰影，比格雷的更詭異
 拖鞋螺喜歡疊羅漢，打造情人摩天樓
 龐大的露脊鯨憋著氣，上演3P戲碼……

 辦那檔子事，也是一種裝備競賽：
 在海裡，尿液是強力春藥
 雌龍蝦就靠這一味，降服心上人
 介形蟲（種子蝦）是攜帶兩把長槍的雙槍俠
 船蛸擁有一根可分離、可發射的那話兒
 而鯨的陰道盤繞彎曲得非常厲害
 精子顯然需要良好的自動導航裝置……

 在洶湧波濤的海面下，隨時都在上演「生」之戲碼
 瑪樂．哈德特帶著幽默機智與科學家的嚴謹
 向我們介紹了鹹濕又狂野的海洋動物性生活
 引領我們應如何把對於性趣的好奇
 轉化為讓海洋生物更加豐沛的力量。

 將近三十億人口倚賴魚類，做為蛋白質的主要攝取來源，
 而其中半數魚類又來自海洋。
 要餵飽這麼多張嘴，每年都需要大量的魚兒成功繁衍小寶寶。
 ……
 不論是發現全新的抗癌藥物、餵飽日增的人口、或刺激經濟，
 我們都需要仰賴豐沛的海洋生物；
 而那種程度的豐沛，需要很多、很多的性愛。
 沒有成功的海洋性愛，我們就完了！
 這也是為什麼，瞭解海面下怎麼辦那檔子事，
 對於住在陸地上的我們，事關重大。
 —— 摘自本書前言〈讓魚鰭打溼吧〉

 消費者必須支持「性友善」海鮮
 （我們的作為不能損害牠們的性成就），
 必須像非營利組織「魚類的未來」所說的，
 要求「履歷魚」或是「自備身世」的魚，
 自備「如何從水中來到餐盤的資訊」，
 譬如魚如何被捕、於何處被捕、何時被捕。
 ……
 鯊魚去鰭以供應這個市場的過程，
 堪稱最浪費又醜惡的捕撈活動之一，
 只見漁民將甲板上的鯊魚的鰭割下來，
 然後就把這些還活著的動物扔下船，
 讓牠們流血到死，
 或是因為沒有魚鰭，無法游泳而活活溺死。
 —— 摘自本書第 8 章〈升高性欲〉

C++ is a powerful, highly flexible, and adaptable programming language that allows software engineers to organize and process information quickly and effectively. But this high-level language is relatively difficult to master, even if you already know the C programming language. The 2nd edition of Practical C++ Programming is a complete introduction to the C++ language for programmers who are learning C++. Reflecting the latest changes to the C++ standard, this 2nd edition takes a useful down-to-earth approach, placing a strong emphasis on how to design clean, elegant code. In short, to-the-point chapters, all aspects of programming are covered including style, software engineering, programming design, object-oriented design, and debugging. It also covers common mistakes and how to find (and avoid) them. End of chapter exercises help you ensure you've mastered the material.  Practical C++ Programming thoroughly covers: C++ Syntax Coding standards and style Creation and use of object classes Templates Debugging and optimization Use of the C++ preprocessor File input/output  Steve Oualline's clear, easy-going writing style and hands-on approach to learning make Practical C++ Programming a nearly painless way to master this complex but powerful programming language.

C++ is a complex language with many subtle facets. This is especially true when it comes to object-oriented and template programming. The C++ Pocket Reference is a memory aid for C++ programmers, enabling them to quickly look up usage and syntax for unfamiliar and infrequently used aspects of the language. The book's small size makes it easy to carry about, ensuring that it will always be at-hand when needed. Programmers will also appreciate the book's brevity; as much information as possible has been crammed into its small pages.In the C++ Pocket Reference, you will find: Information on C++ types and type conversionsSyntax for C++ statements and preprocessor directivesHelp declaring and defining classes, and managing inheritanceInformation on declarations, storage classes, arrays, pointers, strings, and expressionsRefreshers on key concepts of C++ such as namespaces and scopeMore!C++ Pocket Reference is useful to Java and C programmers making the transition to C++, or who find themselves occasionally programming in C++. The three languages are often confusingly similar. This book enables programmers familiar with C or Java to quickly come up to speed on how a particular construct or concept is implemented in C++.Together with its companion STL Pocket Reference, the C++ Pocket Reference forms one of the most concise, easily-carried, quick-references to the C++ language available.

To-the-point, authoritative, no-nonsense solutions have always been a trademark of O'Reilly books. The In a Nutshell books have earned a solid reputation in the field as the well-thumbed references that sit beside the knowledgeable developer's keyboard. C++ in a Nutshell lives up to the In a Nutshell promise. C++ in a Nutshell is a lean, focused reference that offers practical examples for the most important, most often used, aspects of C++. C++ in a Nutshell packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills. The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order, for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers. When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax or parameters required by library routines quickly. What, for example, is the C++ syntax to define an alias for a namespace? Just how do you create and use an iterator to work with the contents of a standard library container? C++ in a Nutshell is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.

On the morning of December 12, 1862, the Union gunboat Cairo, nosing her way up the Yazoo River north of Vicksburg, Mississippi, triggered two Confederate demijohn mines. Within minutes the 512-ton ironclad had sunk six fathoms to the muddy bottom with no loss of life -- the first armored war vessel ever downed by an electronically activated mine. A whole new era of naval warfare had begun.In Hardluck Ironclad Edwin Bearss tells how he and two other Civil War historians discovered the Cairo almost a century later -- still intact at the bottom of the Yazoo, her big guns loaded and ready to fire, much of the gear aboard just as it was that December morning when the crew abandoned her -- and how, almost miraculously, she was later salvaged and restored.

First time, scientifically, a new concept of the absoluteness of bio-intelligence, called as Absolute Intelligence (A-IT) had been put forward to reveal the fundamental nature of life's intelligence, based on a new, basic Physical and Mathematical analysis. The theory of A-IT with its mathematical principals has systematically been presented to identify the boundary between life and natural phenomena by the natural laws (L) and chance (C) and to prove the probability of the life's origin by LC to be exactly zero. And DNA is an A-IT - Sign, impossible to be created by the Chemical Dynamics. Also A-IT is divided into different kinds, each having different level ranges with A-IT - Forbidden Gaps to prohibit the natural transitions among them. Correspondingly, living things are divided into different A-IT level groups, and so to prohibit the natural transitions among them. Thus, the macro-evolution from the primitive cell-life to the advanced living things is prohibited. The life's origin is A-IT cause. The theory of A-IT is harmonious with the Biblical Creation. Life is made in intelligence (wisdom) according to their kinds. The author has been invited to speak in many places in the US and abroad. The present book is a valuable reference for the readers who have the related educational background. (Ying Chao Ruan).

WELCOME ro Beginning ANSI C++: The Complete Language, Third Edition. This is a tuto- rial guide to Standard C++. During the course of the book you'll cover all the funda- mentals of syntax, grammar, object-oriented capability, and the principal features of the standard library. You'll soon gain enough programming know-how to write your own C++ applications. Why C++? C++ is arguably the most widely used programming language in existence. It's used in professional application development because of its immense flexibility, power, and efficiency. For high-performance code across a vast range of programming contexts, C++ is unrivalled. It's also much more accessible than many people assume. With the right guidance, getting a grip on C++ is easier than you might imagine. By developing your C++ skills, you'll learn a language already used by millions, and you'll acquire a new tool in your programming toolbox that is likely to be more powerful than any of the others. The Standard for C++ In 1998, the International Standard for C++, ISO/IEC 14882, was finally approved and adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS). This was the culmination of nine years of work by a joint ANSI/ISO committee whose objective was to establish a single definition of the C++ programming language that would be accepted worldwide.

The forbidding Big Badlands in Western South Dakota contain the richest fossil beds in the world. Even today these rocks continue to yield new specimens brought to light by snowmelt and rain washing away soft rock deposited on a floodplain long ago. The quality and quantity of the fossils are superb: most of the species to be found there are known from hundreds of specimens. The fossils in the White River Group (and similar deposits in the American west) preserve the entire late Eocene through the middle Oligocene, roughly 35-30 million years ago and more than 30 million years after non-avian dinosaurs became extinct. The fossils provide a detailed record of a period of abrupt global cooling and what happened to creatures who lived through it. The book provides a comprehensive reference to the sediments and fossils of the Big Badlands and will complement, enhance, and in some ways replace the classic 1920 volume by Cleophas C. O'Harra. Because the book focuses on a national treasure, it touches on National Park Service management policies that help protect such significant fossils.

Visual Basic is the most popular programming language in the world today. It can be used to quickly create a Windows application and has a short learning curve. However, there are limits to what Visual basic alone can do. By contrast, C++ is used for very complex and advanced systems programming and it has a very steep leaning curve. Because of the difference between the two languages, many programmers develop expertise in either one language or the other. The optimal situation would be for a programmer to be able to harness the power of C++ and take advantage of VB, thus allowing them to create Windows software in the most efficient manner possible. This book teaches VB programmers what they need to know in order to combine these two powerful tools and create truly world-class applications. This book is what Visual Basic programmers have long desired: a book that uses thier existing knowledge as a framework to teach the skills they need to move to the next level, C++. Jonathan Morrison has over five years of experience developing applications in both Visual Basic and C++. He has vast experience integrating Visual Basic and C++ in enterprise environments.

No matter what DBMS you are using--Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL--misunderstandings can always arise over the precise meanings of terms, misunderstandings that can have a serious effect on the success of your database projects. For example, here are some common database terms: attribute, BCNF, consistency, denormalization, predicate, repeating group, join dependency. Do you know what they all mean? Are you sure?The New Relational Database Dictionary defines all of these terms and many, many more. Carefully reviewed for clarity, accuracy, and completeness, this book is an authoritative and comprehensive resource for database professionals, with over 1700 entries (many with examples) dealing with issues and concepts arising from the relational model of data. DBAs, database designers, DBMS implementers, application developers, and database professors and students can find the information they need on a daily basis, information that isn't readily available anywhere else.

C#起源於世界上最成功的兩種語言：C和C++。由C衍生出C#的語法，和許多的關鍵字與運算子。並擴大和改善C++所定義的物件模型。 
C#除了建立於它所繼承的穩固基礎之外，它還新增數個重要的改革，以提升程式設計的技巧。舉個例子來說，C#包含委派（delegate）、特性（property）、索引器（indexer）、以及事件這些語言元素。它也加入支援屬性的語法。除此之外，C#還簡化元件的建立以及消除與COM有關的困擾。 
撰寫C#最具挑戰性的部份就是了解何時要停止！C#語言本身就已經很大。而C#類別函式庫甚至更加龐大。為幫助讀者管理這些龐大的內容，本書將分成三個部份：

USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges (EFRs) are scientific treasures, providing secure, protected research sites where complex and diverse ecological processes are studied over the long term. This book offers several examples of the dynamic interactions among questions of public concern or policy, EFR research, and natural resource management practices and policies. Often, trends observed - or expected -- in the early years of a research program are contradicted or confounded as the research record extends over decades. The EFRs are among the few areas in the US where such long-term research has been carried out by teams of scientists. Changes in society's needs and values can also redirect research programs. Each chapter of this book reflects the interplay between the ecological results that emerge from a long-term research project and the social forces that influence questions asked and resources invested in ecological research. While these stories include summaries and syntheses of traditional research results, they offer a distinctly new perspective, a larger and more complete picture than that provided by a more typical 5-year study. They also provide examples of long-term research on EFRs that have provided answers for questions not even imagined at the time the study was installed.

	當你進入電腦世界，往往被她新奇的功能所吸引，各式各樣五花八門的應用軟體是吸引你的主因。於是你有了自己動手寫程式的遐想。

	 

	要學習電腦程式的撰寫，通常是挑選一種適當的程式語言；例如VB、C++ASP等；先了解該語言所提供的基本指

	令語法，然後依據程式所要達到的功能來構思程式的處理邏輯，最後再用程式指令來實作。

	 

	在設計程式的時候，我們經常將輸出輸入(Presentation)、處理邏輯(Logic)、和資料儲存(Data Store)三者分開處理，以

	提高程式的可攜性，上述三者中以處理邏輯最為複雜。要學會寫程式並不難，但要寫一支夠水準的程式也非易事，因為撰寫程式的任督二脈在於「將處理邏輯建構在資料結構的基礎上」並「實際的用程式指令來實作該處理邏輯」。

	 

	「資料結構」是程式執行過程中用以暫存資料的結構體，它是一些程式變數的集合，搭配程式處理邏輯之運作，便

	能解決許多應用上的問題。一般的「資料結構」書籍大都著重在「資料結構及其處理邏輯」，卻經常忽略了資料結

	構的應用和程式實作的重要性，因而讀者常常有讀懂了書中原理，真正要動手寫程式時卻不知從何下手的困惑。

	 

	「資料結構的設計與應用」一書以淺顯易懂的文字及圖表，搭配範例來介紹「資料結構」的種類及其在各種經常發生的「處理邏輯」上之應用，並且再輔以C++程式的實作與解說，將「資料結構」、「處理邏輯」與「程式實作」三者做緊密的結合，讓讀者不僅可以學會「資料結構」的原理，更能在實際應用上得心應手。

	 

	本書的主要內容有資料結構概觀、陣列結構、鏈結串列結構、堆疊與佇列、遞回、樹狀結構、圖形與網路、資料排序、資料搜尋、赫序函數等，由淺入深的章節編排以及豐富的實例，相信是你建立紮實程式基礎的最佳工具書。

Climate change, urban sprawl, abandonment of agriculture, intensification of forestry and agriculture, changes in energy generation and use, expansion of infrastructure networks, habitat destruction and degradation, and other drivers of change occur at increasing rates. They affect patterns and processes in forest landscapes, and modify ecosystem services derived from those ecosystems. Consequently, rapidly changing landscapes present many new challenges to scientists and managers. While it is not uncommon to encounter the terms ""global change"" and ""landscape"" together in the ecological literature, a global analyses of drivers of change in forest landscapes, and their ecological consequences have not been addressed adequately. That is the goal of this volume: an exploration of the state of knowledge of global changes in forested landscapes with emphasis on causes and effects, and challenges faced by researchers and land managers. Initial chapters identify and describe major agents of landscape change: climate, fire, and human activities. The next series of chapters address implications of changes on ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation and carbon flux. A chapter that describes methodologies of detecting and monitoring landscape changes is presented followed by chapter that highlights the many challenges forest landscape managers face amidst of global change. Finally, we present a summary and a synthesis of the main points presented in the book. Each chapter will contain the individual research experiences of chapter authors, augmented by review and synthesis of global scientific literature on relevant topics, as well as critical input from multiple peer reviewers.

Master how to leverage your data to improve business performance. Today, digitization is dramatically changing the business landscape, and many progressive organizations have started to treat data as a valuable business asset. While many enterprises are investing in improved data management, only a few have leveraged data to truly impact business performance. To address this problem, Data for Business Performance provides readers with practical guidance and proven techniques to derive value from data in today's business environment. Specifically, the book has five key elements that make it unique:  1. The book is holistic, as it looks at deriving value for all three key purposes of data: decision making, compliance, and customer service. 2. The book is for practitioners, with practical guidance and proven techniques supported by real world examples. 3. The book is relevant for the current business and IT landscape. 4. The book is novel, with the adoption of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) framework as the core mechanism to monetize data in the organization, based on business goals, key questions, and key performance indicators (KPIs). 5. The book is technology-agnostic, as concepts are used for unlocking the value of data without any reference to proprietary technologies.

Designed to help birders and banders identify, age, and sex all seventeen species of hummingbirds found in North America, this is the only identification guide devoted entirely to hummingbirds that includes up-close, easy-to-use illustrations. It also provides information on the eight species that have been reported but rarely seen in North America. On first viewing hummingbirds are often a blur of fast-moving color. However, when they perch and hover they can be observed, and the size, shape, and color; the proportions of the body, bill, throat, and tail; the wing feather pattern; and the birds' behavior are crucial to accurate identification. The author's concise descriptions and illustrations pinpoint all these features in clear, jargon-free language. Anyone who loves hummingbirds will welcome the information he provides.

Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB is written for students who want to learn and apply numerical methods in order to solve problems in engineering and science. As such, the methods are motivated by problems rather than by mathematics. That said, sufficient theory is provided so that students come away with insight into the techniques and their shortcomings.McGraw-Hill's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item. Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a ""multi-step solution"" which helps move the students' learning along if they experience difficulty.

C++核心語言
　C++語言的相關書籍分為兩大陣營。一派是把C++當成傳統C語言加以詮釋，依字母順序或功能分門別類，列出一票相干或不相干的函式，以C++重複C語言的範例。另一派則是鼓吹C++物件導向觀念背後的哲學思想，企圖灌輸初學者詭異抽象的物件理論。

　C++是非常複雜語言，沒有一本能夠「一書以蔽之」的經典著作。基本上，它是C語言的延伸，加入了物件導向的功能，但它又不是「真正的」物件導向語言，這些因素都造成學習C++的困難。

There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions. Mastering Algorithms with C offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques.Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included.Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth.Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate. Understanding that these techniques may be unfamiliar to some programmers, Loudon explains them clearly in the introductory chapters.Contents include: PointersRecursionAnalysis of algorithmsData structures (lists, stacks, queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps, priority queues, graphs)Sorting and searchingNumerical methodsData compressionData encryptionGraph algorithmsGeometric algorithms

When the first European explorers reached the southern shores of North America in the early seventeenth century, they faced a solid forest that stretched all the way from the Atlantic coast to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. The ways in which they and their descendants used-and abused-the forest over the next nearly four hundred years form the subject of The Southern Forest. In chapters on the explorers, pioneers, lumbermen, boatbuilders, and foresters, Laurence Walker chronicles the constant demands that people have made on forest resources in the South. He shows how the land's very abundance became its greatest liability, as people overhunted the animals, clearcut the forests, and wore out the soil with unwise farming practices-all in a mistaken belief that the forest's bounty (including new ground to be broken) was inexhaustible. With the advent of professional forestry in the twentieth century, however, the southern forest has made a comeback. A professional forester himself, Walker speaks from experience of the difficulties that foresters face in balancing competing interests in the forest. How, for example, does one reconcile the country's growing demand for paper products with the insistence of environmental groups that no trees be cut? Should national forests be strictly recreational areas, or can they support some industrial logging? How do foresters avoid using chemical pesticides when the public protests such natural management practices as prescribed burning and tree cutting? This personal view of the southern forest adds a new dimension to the study of southern history and culture. The primeval southern forest is gone, but, with careful husbandry on the part of all users, the regenerated southern forest may indeed prove to be the inexhaustible resource of which our ancestors dreamed.

Suitable for upper-level undergraduates, this accessible approach to set theory poses rigorous but simple arguments. Each definition is accompanied by commentary that motivates and explains new concepts. Starting with a repetition of the familiar arguments of elementary set theory, the level of abstract thinking gradually rises for a progressive increase in complexity.A historical introduction presents a brief account of the growth of set theory, with special emphasis on problems that led to the development of the various systems of axiomatic set theory. Subsequent chapters explore classes and sets, functions, relations, partially ordered classes, and the axiom of choice. Other subjects include natural and cardinal numbers, finite and infinite sets, the arithmetic of ordinal numbers, transfinite recursion, and selected topics in the theory of ordinals and cardinals. This updated edition features new material by author Charles C. Pinter.

When Charles Darwin finished The Origin of Species, he thought that he had explained every clue, but one. Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the ""Cambrian explosion,"" many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock. In Darwin's Doubt, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life--a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information--stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells--to building animal forms.Expanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, Signature in the Cell, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL REPORTS: How to Write and Illustrate provides step-by-step advice on tackling various tasks associated with report writing like gathering information, analyzing information, preparing an outline, writing a rough draft and revising. Many examples illustrate the processes involved at various steps. A stepwise approach to computer-assisted preparation of tables and various types of figures like line drawings, bar charts, histograms, flowcharts, etc., is provided. Also presented are suggestions about how to use commonly available computer programs to give visual shape to ideas, concepts, processes and cause and effect relations described in the text. Use of readability tests is explained as a screening system for checking comprehensibility of language used. Readers are alerted to some of the common pitfalls in science writing like redundancy, overuse of nouns, noun chains, excessive use of passive voice, use of overlong sentences and ambiguity. Checklist at the end of each chapter sums up the most important points.Though the primary aim of the book is to provide help in writing reports and dissertations, it can be used as a help in tackling other forms of scientific and technical writing also.

Astrobiology is an exciting new subject, and one, arguably, more interdisciplinary than any other. Astrobiologists seek to understand the origin and evolution of life on Earth in order to illuminate and guide the search for life on other planets. In this Very Short Introduction, David C. Catling introduces the subject through our understanding of the factors that allowed life to arise and persist on our own planet, and for the signs we are looking for in the search for extraterrestrial life. About the Series: Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every Very Short Introduction gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the Very Short Introductions series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.

Mathematics is beautiful--and it can be fun and exciting as well as practical. Good Math is your guide to some of the most intriguing topics from two thousand years of mathematics: from Egyptian fractions to Turing machines; from the real meaning of numbers to proof trees, group symmetry, and mechanical computation. If you've ever wondered what lay beyond the proofs you struggled to complete in high school geometry, or what limits the capabilities of computer on your desk, this is the book for you.  Why do Roman numerals persist? How do we know that some infinities are larger than others? And how can we know for certain a program will ever finish? In this fast-paced tour of modern and not-so-modern math, computer scientist Mark Chu-Carroll explores some of the greatest breakthroughs and disappointments of more than two thousand years of mathematical thought. There is joy and beauty in mathematics, and in more than two dozen essays drawn from his popular ""Good Math"" blog, you'll find concepts, proofs, and examples that are often surprising, counterintuitive, or just plain weird.  Mark begins his journey with the basics of numbers, with an entertaining trip through the integers and the natural, rational, irrational, and transcendental numbers. The voyage continues with a look at some of the oddest numbers in mathematics, including zero, the golden ratio, imaginary numbers, Roman numerals, and Egyptian and continuing fractions. After a deep dive into modern logic, including an introduction to linear logic and the logic-savvy Prolog language, the trip concludes with a tour of modern set theory and the advances and paradoxes of modern mechanical computing.  If your high school or college math courses left you grasping for the inner meaning behind the numbers, Mark's book will both entertain and enlighten you.

Digital technology has become a ubiquitous feature of modern life. Our increasingly fast-paced world seems more and more remote from the world narrated in Scripture. But despite its pervasiveness, there remains a dearth of theological reflection about computer technology and what it means to live as a faithful Christian in a digitally-saturated society. In this thoughtful and timely book, Derek Schuurman provides a brief theology of technology, rooted in the Reformed tradition and oriented around the grand themes of creation, fall, redemption and new creation. He combines a concise, accessible style with penetrating cultural and theological analysis. Building on the work of Jacques Ellul, Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and drawing from a wide range of Reformed thinkers, Schuurman situates computer technology within the big picture of the biblical story. Technology is not neutral, but neither is there an exclusively ""Christian"" form of technological production and use. Instead, Schuurman guides us to see the digital world as part of God's good creation, fallen yet redeemable according to the law of God. Responsibly used, technology can become an integral part of God's shalom for the earth.

When Charles Darwin finished The Origin of Species, he thought that he had explained every clue, but one. Though his theory could explain many facts, Darwin knew that there was a significant event in the history of life that his theory did not explain. During this event, the ""Cambrian explosion,"" many animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record without apparent ancestors in earlier layers of rock. In Darwin's Doubt, Stephen C. Meyer tells the story of the mystery surrounding this explosion of animal life--a mystery that has intensified, not only because the expected ancestors of these animals have not been found, but because scientists have learned more about what it takes to construct an animal. During the last half century, biologists have come to appreciate the central importance of biological information--stored in DNA and elsewhere in cells--to building animal forms.Expanding on the compelling case he presented in his last book, Signature in the Cell, Meyer argues that the origin of this information, as well as other mysterious features of the Cambrian event, are best explained by intelligent design, rather than purely undirected evolutionary processes.

Because of concerns about the effect of internet blocking mechanisms, and the implications of censorship, many individuals and groups are working hard to ensure that the Internet, and the information on it, are freely available to everyone who wants it. This book documents simple circumvention techniques such as a cached file or web proxy, and also describes more complex methods using Tor, which stands for The Onion Router, involving a sophisticated network of proxy servers.The first edition of this book was created in 2008 by a group of Net Geeks who were concerned about the encroachments on Internet freedom they saw in certain areas of the world. Little did we dream then that we would see the day in just a few years that the United States would become the epicenter of encroachment on FREE SPEECH and FREE EXPRESSION. But as we enter 2021 the doors are closing fast in ways we never imagined.The Internet was created to be open and as a marketplace of ideas, but sadly the largest providers and governments are now squelching those freedoms. We developed this book with an eye to helping people in Iran, Pakistan, China, North Korea and such and the book has been translated into Arabic, Vietnamese, Spanish, Russian, Burmese (Myanmar), Persian (Farsi) and Chinese. It's NOW time to update the book and publish it in as many languages as possible before the dissemination of this information becomes much more difficult.I was involved early on in the publication of ""How to Bypass Internet Censorship"" and published the first edition on Amazon in 2009. Now we have totally rewritten this manual, updating the WWW links, adding new procedures, clarifying others, and adding new topics:  - - Freedomfone- - Airtime for Broadcasters- - Open Translation Tools- - Guide to Independent Video Hosting- - Tech Tools for Activism- - Basic Internet Security

There are lots of introductory C books, but this is the first one that has the no-nonsense, practical approach that has made Nutshell Handbooks(R) famous.C programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&& comes before comes before ?: ). The practical programmer reduces these to two: Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's code. This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art of going through someone else's code, is described.This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and features in the language.

Intimate in size yet quietly breathtaking in scope, this graceful gift book will forever change how you think, and how you feel, about trees. In poetically sparse scientific observations, renowned conservation biologist Gretchen Daily narrates the evolution, impact, and natural wonder of trees. Alongside photographs by Chuck Katz, the text and images form a quiet and moving meditation on The Power of Trees. Twenty-six duotone black and white photographs illustrate the development of trees: how trunks were formed, what tree rings tell us about human societies, and how trees define the future of humanity. Pictures of trees threading through the landscape - dotting mountainsides, braiding along the sides of glassine rivers - bear witness to the lyrical force and clarity of Daily's observations. Recreating the authors' hike together through the landscape of the Skagit River in Washington State, the balletic movement between Daily's commentary and Katz's vision reaches out to readers, inviting them to enjoy the landscape through a scientific understanding of trees. At once emotional and intellectual, The Power of Trees is the first collection of nature photographs that invites the reader to not only delight in the gorgeous play between light and shadow, but also the fascinating natural mechanisms that create such striking natural beauty. An ecologist by training, Gretchen Daily is an internationally acclaimed conservancy advocate and scholar. Her role as a National Trustee for The Nature Conservancy will feature prominently in the national marketing campaign to bridge the gap between scientific educators and the general nature reader.

As the astronauts' home base and the site of Mission Control, the Johnson Space Center has witnessed some of the most triumphant moments in American history. Spanning initiatives from the 1960s to 1993, this illustrated volume traces the center's history, starting with its origins at the beginning of the space race in the late 1950s. Thrilling, authoritative accounts explain the development and achievements of the early space voyages; the lunar landing; the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs; and the space shuttles and international space station. As astronaut Donald K. Slayton notes in his Foreword, this chronicle emphasizes the cooperation of ""humans on space and on the ground. It realistically balances the role of the highly visible astronaut with the mammoth supporting team."" An official NASA publication, Suddenly, Tomorrow Came is profusely illustrated with forty-four figures and tables, plus sixty-three photographs. Historian Paul Dickson brings the narrative up to date with an informative new Introduction.

Waltzes with Giants is a moving portrait of one of the earth's largest endangered mammals. Mystical and provocative, the book is inspired by a real North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and her threatened migrations from Atlantic Canada to her calving grounds off the coasts of Georgia and Florida. In the spirit of marine biologist and conservationist Rachel Carson's sea trilogy, the story evokes the wonder, the sorrow, and the conflicts associated with this member of the suborder Mysticetes (baleen whales). Blending sound science and art with a literary voice, Peter C. Stone takes us beneath the waves to reveal how we have historically decimated many species of whales and other species of fish and aquatic mammals for material gain, even though they are an integral part of the ecosystems upon which we depend. Supported by a glossary of scientific and book-specific words, as well as a list of resource links for the North Atlantic right whale and other marine mammals, Waltzes with Giants is built upon questions. While inviting us to imagine how our consuming culture impacts the ocean with fishing gear, waste, and noise, Stone's passionate prose and ""dreamy, evocative"" (School Library Journal) paintings captivate readers of all ages by making science and the marvels of the oceans engaging and comprehensible.

In ecosystems with many species, food webs form highly complex networks of resource-consumer interactions. At the same time, the food web as itself needs sufficient resources to develop and survive. So in fact, food web ecology is about how natural resources form the basis of biological communities, in terms of species richness and abundances as well as how species are organised in communities on the basis of the resource availability and use. The central theme of this book is that patterns in the utilisation of energy result from the trophic interactions among species, and that these patterns form the basis of ecosystem stability. The authors integrate the latest work on community dynamics, ecosystem energetics, and stability, and in so doing attempt to dispel the categorisation of the field into the separate subdisciplines of population, community, and ecosystem ecology. Energetic Food Webs represents the first attempt to bridge the gap between the energetic and species approaches to ecology.

The burgeoning new science of epigenetics offers a cornucopia of insights--some comforting, some frightening. For example, the male fetus may be especially vulnerable to certain common chemicals in our environment, in ways that damage not only his own sperm but also the sperm of his sons. And it's epigenetics that causes identical twins to vary widely in their susceptibility to dementia and cancer. But here's the good news: unlike mutations, epigenetic effects are reversible. Indeed, epigenetic engineering is the future of medicine.

Organic synthesis forms the most important integral part of Organic Chemistry. This requires a knowledge of all carbob-carbon bonding reactions, functional group modifications, mechanisms of reactions, the stereochemistry of the reactions, protection and de-protection during organic synthesis etc. Synthesis of an organic compound often a natural product, biologically active had been considered as best supporting evidence for their structure and stereochemistry. It is possible to synthesise compounds resembling natural products and to study their biological activity. With the help of the above the structuren activity relationship can be deduced. Along with Bioinformatics the mechanism and the site of reaction of a drug can be evaluated. This can further help the synthetic organic chemist to synthesise more potent drugs for many diseases.

The New York Times bestseller about the strange history of NASA and its cover-ups regarding its origins and extraterrestrial architecture found on the moon and Mars is even more interesting in its new edition.Authors Richard C. Hoagland and Mike Bara include a new chapter about the discoveries made by ex-Nazi scientist and NASA stalwart Wernher von Braun regarding what he termed ""alternate gravitational solutions,"" or the rewriting of Newtonian physics into hyperdimensional spheres.

Updated for the first time in over twenty years, the third edition of Insects of the Los Angeles Basin is a beautifully produced and richly illustrated field guide to more than 450 common or conspicuous insects, spiders, millipedes, and other arthropods that inhabit the region. Each species account describes the size and physical characteristics of insects at their adult and immature stages. Entries also incorporate information on habitat, geographic range, behavior, food preferences, nests, noises, and scents--even lore of the more notorious species. Color-coded sections organize species by order, and 500 photographs and line drawings help with easy identification. The book's engaging and accessible writing includes introductory chapters that explain the characteristics of insects and the ecology of Los Angeles, back matter for starting an insect collection and suggestions for further reading, and a new preface discussing the tremendous effects of technological advances and citizen science on the field of entomology. Written with the Greater Los Angeles Basin as its focus but useful to residents of the entire coastal area of Southern California from Santa Barbara to San Diego, this book is an invaluable resource for hikers, gardeners, teachers, students, and anyone else curious about the diversity of life in our midst.

Here you will learn how to develop an attractive, easily readable, conceptual, business-oriented entity/relationship model, using a variation on the UML Class Model notation. This book has two audiences:   Data modelers (both analysts and database designers) who are convinced that UML has nothing to do with them; and UML experts who don't realize that architectural data modeling really is different from object modeling (and that the differences are important).  David Hay's objective is to finally bring these two groups together in peace.  Here all modelers will receive guidance on how to produce a high quality (that is, readable) entity/relationship model to describe the data architecture of an organization. The notation involved happens to be the one for class models in the Unified Modeling Language, even though UML was originally developed to support object-oriented design. Designers have a different view of the world from those who develop business-oriented conceptual data models, which means that to use UML for architectural modeling requires some adjustments. These adjustments are described in this book.  David Hay is the author of Enterprise Model Patterns: Describing the World, a comprehensive model of a generic enterprise. The diagrams were at various levels of abstraction, and they were all rendered in the slightly modified version of UML Class Diagrams presented here. This book is a handbook to describe how to build models such as these. By way of background, an appendix provides a history of the two groups, revealing the sources of their different attitudes towards the system development process.

The Dodo and the Solitaire is the most comprehensive book to date about these two famously extinct birds. It contains all the known contemporary accounts and illustrations of the dodo and solitaire, covering their history after extinction and discussing their ecology, classification, phylogenetic placement, and evolution. Both birds were large and flightless and lived on inhabited islands some 500 miles east of Madagascar. The first recorded descriptions of the dodo were provided by Dutch sailors who first encountered them in 1598--within 100 years, the dodo was extinct. So quickly did the bird disappear that there is insufficient evidence to form an entirely accurate picture of its appearance and ecology, and the absence has led to much speculation. The story of the dodo, like that of the solitaire, has been pieced together from fragments, both literary and physical, that have been carefully compiled and examined in this extraordinary volume.

Metallic systems are ubiquitous in daily life. They play key roles, for example, in the chemistry of many biomolecules, ionic solutions, nanoparticles, and catalytic processes. They may be in solid, liquid, or gaseous form. The interactions of other molecules with metal surfaces are of considerable importance. Each of these topics is addressed in Metallic Systems. As we have entered the age where theoretical approaches are sufficiently mature to complement and guide experiments in many areas, an understanding of the theoretical tools and approaches to studying metallic systems is essential. Metallic Systems is concerned with enhancing our understanding of the diverse chemistry of metals and metal-containing systems and the applicability of modern quantum chemistry methodologies to study them.Metallic Systems presents brief overviews of most of the popular approaches to quantum chemical treatments and computations of chemical systems that include metals. Attention is given to the potentialities and limitations of first principles Density Functional Theory and dynamics methods (e.g. QM/MM approaches). The book emphasizes the importance of using methods that take into account crucial physical features such as explicit solvation, temperature and dynamics of metal-containing systems. It emphasizes first principles calculations in providing reliable and detailed information concerning electronic structures, mechanisms, and reaction energetics.Accessible to newcomers to the field,  Metallic Systems overviews theory underpinning current methodologies. It presents a practical set of modalities for studying metallic systems, assesses current technological barriers, and examines future challenges and topics of exploration.

在職場上，不可避免地會被要求趕工、加功能，即便大師也不例外，遇到這些情況，你必須學會Say No，同樣地，你也必須學會Say Yes，只有謹慎地Say Yes，別人才會對你有所尊重，相信你是一位專業人士，如此當你在Say No時，才會更有分量，更能說服對方。本書作者Bob大叔，Robert C. Martin，是一位軟體大師，也是一位著名作家，其著作《Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices》曾獲得有IT奧斯卡獎之稱──Jolt震撼年度大獎。本書適用對象本書是Bob大叔近期的新作，在本書中，Bob大叔以親身經歷及輔導過的案例作為範例，以說故事的方式來描述各種情景。如果你寫程式專案超過一年，相信這些情景你一定不陌生，那都是軟體開發過程常遇到的真實情境。不同的是，以往你只會做出一種回應，因此事態的發展只有一條路徑，而最終就陷入了一種悲慘的循環。那是個什麼樣的循環呢？1.在面對一個新的專案或功能時，沒有一套科學的辦法來進行時程的預估〈老是估不準〉。2.開發過程中，老是〈無法集中專注力〉，被這樣的事、那樣的事所影響，工作效率極差。3.由於工作效率差，所以跟不上進度，〈壓力〉來了，只好加班熬夜來趕工。也〈沒時間寫測試〉。4.加班熬夜寫出的程式，品質比較差，常常出現bug。5.由於沒有寫測試，沒有一套自動化測試，所以〈除錯〉又花了許多時間，導致要加更多的班來進行除錯。6.在接近專案截止日之前，終於快要完工了，但是客戶又要求〈加入新功能〉。但也給你更多的時間來開發，使你無法拒絕。7.由於大多數程式碼都是加班趕出來的，品質非常差，因此在擴充功能時難以修改。只好回頭做〈重構〉。8.由於加班趕工沒做好自動化測試，所以當加入新功能後，對於〈原有功能是否因此出錯了？〉，沒有把握，所以必須花做更多的時間在測試。現在又回到了1或2，直到客戶不再要求加入新功能為止。9.已經沒時間測試了，在最終的截止日期還是把結果給發佈出去了。〈交給客戶去測吧〉。客戶必須測完後才會交付尾款。10.由於沒有進行完整的測試，因此，客戶發現了bug，所以要求修改，同時也對您所推出的最後版本產生懷疑，因此使得〈專案遲遲無法結案，無法收到尾款〉。現在又回到了5，直到有天客戶的常用功能都OK了，或者你再也受不了而離職，甚至放棄收取尾款為止。即便離職或放棄尾款也不能解決問題，因為你還是必須接新的專案，而這又回到了1。以上的循環是否讓您感覺生活品質很差呢？是不是懷疑自己走錯行了呢？其實不是這樣的，問題在於你沒有找對方法來處理每一個步驟的應對之策。這本書，從每個您所熟悉的故事中，發展出不同的分支，教導您如果這樣做，結果會是怎樣？如果那樣做，結局又會是怎樣？Bob大叔開的是一間顧問公司，寫程式也有四十幾年了，因此，他提出的做法完全是經驗的累積，經得起實際的考驗。如果您有疑慮，那大可不必一次全部都應用到同一個專案中，一次針對某一項來修改應對之策，您會發現，即便只是針對某一項來作修正，都會讓您獲益匪淺。本書大多數的篇幅都在說故事，以說故事的方式來論理，當中有大約四個章節是和技術高度相關的，當中包含TDD、驗收測試、測試策略、協作、工具等等。關於這些議題，本書並未提供程式碼，而是以方法介紹為主軸來進行介紹，若你想看看實際程式碼的示範，可以參閱《無瑕的程式碼》一書。PS：《無瑕的程式碼》上市後，連續三月勇奪IT專業書局銷售冠軍，非常值得一讀。www.drmaster.com.tw/Bookinfo.asp?BookID=PG21219兩書閱讀方式這兩本姊妹書並沒有固定的閱讀順序，如果您先讀本書《無瑕的程式碼──番外篇 The Clean Coder》，但對於實際的Clean Code有所好奇的話，可再去翻閱《無瑕的程式碼Clean Code》。如果您先讀的是《無瑕的程式碼Clean Code》，但對於怎樣把Clean Code帶入職場有所疑問的話，則本書將為您解惑。雖然單一本書已經能夠提升您的職場價值。但對於一位專業的程式設計師而言，最好是兩本書都讀過，如此才能發揮最大的效用。 本書特色要介紹這本書的特色，就不得不介紹《無瑕的程式碼Clean Code》一書，因為兩書是互補的。在該書中，作者教您的是如何做事（也就是如何寫出Clean Code）。而本書中，作者教您的是如何做人（也就是如何做個Clean Coder）。要想成為一位Clean Coder，可不簡單，絕不是只學會寫Clean Code就可以了。還需要把寫Clean Code融入到真實的職場生涯當中。而這就牽涉到了職場求生術這類的議題。在工作中撰寫Clean Code，初期一定會遇到一些困難，本書將教導您如何應付這些困難，說服上司、老闆、客戶、夥伴以及自己，以寫Clean Code的精神來應付開發專案時所遭遇的各種情況，才是正道。

Here you'll find one key to the development of a successful information system: Clearly capture and communicate both the abstract and concrete building blocks of data that describe your organization. In 1995, David Hay published Data Model Patterns: Conventions of Thought - the groundbreaking book on how to use standard data models to describe the standard business situations. Enterprise Model Patterns: Describing the World builds on the concepts presented there, adds 15 years of practical experience, and presents a more comprehensive view.You will learn how to apply both the abstract and concrete elements of your enterprise's architectural data model through four levels of abstraction: Level 0: An abstract template that underlies the Level 1 model that follows, plus two meta models:   Information Resources. In addition to books, articles, and e-mail notes, it also includes photographs, videos, and sound recordings. Accounting. Accounting is remarkable because it is itself a modeling language. It takes a very different approach than data modelers in that instead of using entities and entity classes that represent things in the world, it is concerned with accounts that represent bits of value to the organization.  Level 1: An enterprise model that is generic enough to apply to any company or government agency, but concrete enough to be readily understood by all. It describes:   People and Organization. Who is involved with the business? The people involved are not only the employees within the organization, but customers, agents, and others with whom the organization comes in contact. Organizations of interest include the enterprise itself and its own internal departments, as well as customers, competitors, government agencies, and the like. Geographic Locations. Where is business conducted? A geographic location may be either a geographic area (defined as any bounded area on the Earth), a geographic point (used to identify a particular location), or, if you are an oil company for example, a geographic solid (such as an oil reserve). Assets. What tangible items are used to carry out the business? These are any physical things that are manipulated, sometimes as products, but also as the means to producing products and services. Activities. How is the business carried out? This model not only covers services offered, but also projects and any other kinds of activities. In addition, the model describes the events that cause activities to happen. Time. All data is positioned in time, but some more than others.  Level 2:  A more detailed model describing specific functional areas:   Facilities Human Resources Communications and Marketing Contracts Manufacturing The Laboratory  Level 3: Examples of the details a model can have to address what is truly unique in a particular industry.

Civil engineer Samuel Forman's The Civilized Engineer is aimed at both those observing and commenting externally on engineering, and the practicing engineer--to reveal something of the art behind great engineering achievements, and to stimulate debate upon the author's hypothesis that in its moment of ascendance, engineering is faced with the trivialization of its purpose and the debasement of its practice.

Birds of the Cottage Country is a virtual storybook account of the author's personalized observations throughout Ontario's cottage playground. It clearly illustrates the downright fun, vast beauty, and consuming involvement of bird watching - even for the most skeptical of laymen.  Bill Mansell's daily experiences at birding, spread over a period of sixty-five years, result in such a familiarity with his subject that the reader is drawn as a participant into a delicately beautiful intimacy with avian nature.  Birds of the Cottage Country will be read by some solely for its humour and humanistic style; yet serious birdwatchers will also find it a refreshingly new guide and reference tool.

本書榮獲iThome年度百大好書推薦本書的原文書名為《Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship》，根據作者的說法，《無瑕的程式碼》為Jolt得獎著作《敏捷軟體開發：原則、樣式及實務》的前傳。在台灣另一本銷售極佳的書籍《重構─改善既有程式的設計》，根據亞馬遜Amazon網站的統計，購買該書原文版《Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code》，又同時購買的其他書籍第一名，正是《Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship》這一本書。．第一章作者開宗明義說明什麼是Clean Code，他詢問了包含C++發明人Bjarne Stroustrup、Eclipse策略教父Dave Thomas、極限程式設計大師Ron Jeffries、維基與極限程式設計發明人，Ward Cunningham等等的大師，從他們的眼光來描述什麼是Clean Code，最後才說到作者本人認為的Clean Code應該長成什麼樣子，有什麼好處，以及學習撰寫Clean Code的基本原則。小編只能說，能和那麼多大師對談，就已經證明了作者也是一位大師其餘部分本書分成三部份。 　．第一部份包含有許多章節，這些章節將描述撰寫clean code的原則、模式及實踐，這些章節包含了不少的程式碼篇幅，閱讀它們頗具有挑戰性。這些章節替你準備好閱讀第二部份所需的背景知識。．第二部份這裡包含許多複雜性不斷增加的案例討論。在這個部分，作者會直接帶領您進行整個重構的過程，每次的修改，作者都會說明原因，重構的對象並不僅止於一般的程式，甚至還包含了著名的框架，例如JUnit（哇！把開放原始碼框架拿來重構，真酷)。．第三部份終於到了成果收割的時候。最後一章列出了案例討論時搜集到的程式啟發和氣味。在案例討論裡走過和清理程式碼時，紀錄了每個行為的原因，並整理成一種程式啟發或氣味，成了一個知識庫，這個知識庫可以說是整本書的精華與交互參照。

First published in 1990, Forests explores the ecological, economic, and human influences on over thirty significant types of woodlands. Laurence Walker focuses especially on the effects of site factors--climate, physiography, biology, and soils--upon the growth of various kinds of trees. Projects for amateur naturalists, reading lists, and a glossary make this the perfect introduction for general readers.

LINQ is the part of the .NET Framework that provides a generic approach to querying data from different data sources. It has quickly become the next must-have skill for .NET developers. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2010 is all about code. Literally, this book starts with code and ends with code. Most books show the simplest examples of how to use a method, but they so rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. This book is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and prototypes, it is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples.Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, this book cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold.Face it, most technical books, while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, this book will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and C# 2010.

Informatics in Medical Imaging provides a comprehensive survey of the field of medical imaging informatics. In addition to radiology, it also addresses other specialties such as pathology, cardiology, dermatology, and surgery, which have adopted the use of digital images. The book discusses basic imaging informatics protocols, picture archiving and communication systems, and the electronic medical record. It details key instrumentation and data mining technologies used in medical imaging informatics as well as practical operational issues, such as procurement, maintenance, teleradiology, and ethics.Highlights   Introduces the basic ideas of imaging informatics, the terms used, and how data are represented and transmitted Emphasizes the fundamental communication paradigms: HL7, DICOM, and IHE Describes information systems that are typically used within imaging departments: orders and result systems, acquisition systems, reporting systems, archives, and information-display systems Outlines the principal components of modern computing, networks, and storage systems Covers the technology and principles of display and acquisition detectors, and rounds out with a discussion of other key computer technologies Discusses procurement and maintenance issues; ethics and its relationship to government initiatives like HIPAA; and constructs beyond radiology The technologies of medical imaging and radiation therapy are so complex and computer-driven that it is difficult for physicians and technologists responsible for their clinical use to know exactly what is happening at the point of care. Medical physicists are best equipped to understand the technologies and their applications, and these individuals are assuming greater responsibilities in the clinical arena to ensure that intended care is delivered in a safe and effective manner. Built on a foundation of classic and cutting-edge research, Informatics in Medical Imaging supports and updates medical physicists functioning at the intersection of radiology and radiation.

With nearly 20 percent of the world's population located in China, what happens there is significant to all nations. Sweeping changes have altered the cultural landscape of China, and as opportunities for wealth have grown in recent years, so have opportunities for crime. Police Reform in China provides a rare and insightful glimpse of policing in the midst of such change.The book begins with a historical account of police reform in the region since 2000. Next, it discusses the difficulties encountered in trying to understand Chinese policing, such as outdated perceptions, misinformation, cultural ignorance, ideological hegemony, and problems with paternalistic attitudes. The book recommends studying China from a local perspective informed by local research and data, suggesting that understanding China requires a cultural shift to the Chinese way of life in thinking and, more importantly, feeling.The author then summarizes selected policy papers from Gongan Yanjiu, a leading international policy journal. He first documents how the thinking and aspirations of various generations of Chinese leaders from Mao to Deng, and now Jiang and Hu, came to affect Chinese policing in theory and practice. He then addresses the emergence of a police legitimacy crisis as evidenced by the deterioration of public image and rebellions against police authority. Demonstrating how old ideologies are increasingly in conflict with the values and lifestyles of a new mentality, the book discusses steps that can be taken to improve professionalism. The final chapters investigate such problems as abuses of discretion and the improper use of firearms and highlight the importance of understanding the Chinese people, culture, values, and interests in order to truly effectuate successful police reform.

Praise for the first edition--""This book is guaranteed to enrich the reader's next forest visit.""--Library Journal""Pielou's book brings forest ecology to naturalists, bird lovers, hikers, cyclists, canoeists, skiers, mountaineers, and back-country campers.""--Seattle Post-Intelligencer""It is E. C. Pielou's contention that evergreen forests... are taken for granted and rarely well understood. To remedy this, the distinguished biogeographer has written a book focusing on the northern evergreen forests. This is a book that many naturalists, both novice and experienced, will read with pleasure and interest.""--Canadian Field-Naturalist""Pielou makes a strong, irrefutable, case for the preservation of old-growth forests and wilderness. Anyone who appreciates the outdoors should have this book and take its message to heart.""--Forest Planning CanadaGlobal warming and human-driven impacts from logging, natural gas drilling, mining of oil sands, and the development of hydropower increasingly threaten North America's northern forests. These forests are far from being a uniform environment; close inspection reveals that the conifers that thrive there--pines, larches, spruces, hemlocks, firs, Douglas-firs, arborvitaes, false-cypresses, junipers, and yews--support a varied and complex ecosystem. In The World of Northern Evergreens, the noted ecologist E. C. Pielou introduces the biology of the northern forests and provides a unique invitation to naturalists, ecologists, foresters, and everyone living in northern North America who wants to learn about this unique and threatened northern world and the species that make it their home.Through identification keys, descriptions, and life histories of the conifer tree species, the author emphasizes how different these plants are both biologically and evolutionarily from the hardwoods we also call ""trees."" Following this introduction to the essential conifers, the author's perceptive insights expand to include the interactions of conifers with other plants, fungi, mammals, birds, and amphibians.The second edition, enriched by new illustrations by the author of woodland features and creatures, updates the text to include new topics including mycorrhizal fungi, soil, woodlice, bats, and invasive insects such as the hemlock woolly adelgid. Emphasis is given to the very real human-driven impacts that threaten the species that live in and depend on the vital and complex forest ecosystem. Pielou provides us with a rich understanding of the northern forests in this work praised for its nontechnical presentation, scientific objectivity, and original illustrations.

""A fascinating, well-documented biography."" --New York Times Book Review ""A monumental effort."" --New York Review of Books ""An excellent piece of science writing. . . . Cassidy does not so much exculpate Heisenberg as explain him, with a transparency that makes this biography a pleasure to read."" --Los Angeles Times ""Cassidy has written the definitive biography of a great and tragic physicist."" --Richard Rhodes, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Making of the Atomic Bomb Since the fall of the Soviet Union, long-suppressed information has emerged on Werner Heisenberg's role in the Nazi atomic bomb project. In Beyond Uncertainty, Cassidy interprets this and other previously unknown material within the context of his vast research and tackles the vexing questions of a scientist's personal responsibility and guilt when serving an abhorrent military regime. David C. Cassidy is the author of Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb; A Short History of Physics in the American Century; J. Robert Oppenheimer and the American Century; and Einstein and Our World. He is the recipient of the Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics from the American Physical Society, the Science Writing Award from the American Institute of Physics, the Pfizer Award from the History of Science Society, and an honorary doctorate from Purdue University.

Die Wettbewerbsfahigkeit von Industrieunternehmen hangt massgeblich von der Produktivitat der eingesetzten Anlagen und Produktionsprozesse ab. Um ein hohes Mass an Produktivitat zu garantieren, mussen durch Fehler verursachte Standzeiten so kurz wir moglich gehalten werden. Dazu werden effiziente Methoden zur Fehlerdiagnose benotigt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein modellbasiertes Diagnose-Verfahren fur ereignisdiskrete Closed-Loop Systeme entwickelt. Die betrachteten Systeme bestehen aus dem geschlossenen Kreis von Steuerung und Prozess. Durch den systematischen Vergleich von aktuell beobachtetem und durch ein Systemmodell erwartetem Verhalten konnen Fehler in Echtzeit erkannt und isoliert werden. In der Arbeit wurden geeignete Modellidentifikationsverfahren fur Ereignisdiskrete Systeme entwickelt, sodass die aufwandige manuelle Modellbildung vermieden wird. Die entwickelten Methoden wurden im Labor und im Rahmen einer Industrieanwendung erfolgreich getestet.

Every year, more than twenty species of terns, gulls, and colonial wading birds raise their young on rookery islands all along the Gulf Coast. Their breeding and nesting activities go on in the wake of passing oil tankers, commercial fishing vessels, and pleasure boats of all kinds--human traffic that threatens their already circumscribed habitats. John C. Dyes has spent more than ten years photographing and observing the birds in their rookeries on the Texas Coast, and, in Nesting Birds of the Coastal Islands, he presents a year in the birds' life through fine photographs and an evocative and informative text. In a month-by-month account, he follows the annual rituals and daily dramas of courtship, mating, and chick rearing among herons, egrets, spoonbills, cormorants, ibises, and other birds that migrate and gather in colonies ranging from half a dozen birds to tens of thousands. Interspersed throughout the text are species descriptions to help aid identification. Dyes also discusses the bird-human history of the area, describing the near-extinctions caused by plume hunters a century ago and the serious modern threats posed by industrial and recreational uses of Galveston Bay, as well as contemporary efforts by the National Audubon Society and other groups to preserve the bird islands as avian sanctuaries. If wading birds are to survive in the Galveston Bay area, their need for undisturbed habitats in which to live and breed must be known and respected by the human species. Nesting Birds of the Coastal Islands will make an informative and enjoyable contribution to that knowledge.

Of the approximately 180 original scientific papers that Einstein published in his lifetime, about 40 are infested with mistakes. For instance, Einstein s first mathematical proof of the famous formulaE = mc2 was incomplete and only approximately valid; he struggled with this problem for many years, but he never found a complete proof (better mathematicians did). Einstein was often lured by irrational and mystical inspirations, but his extraordinary intuition about physics permitted him to discover profound truths despite and sometimes because of the mistakes he made along the way. He was a sleepwalker: his intuition told him where he needed to go, and he somehow managed to get there without quite knowing how. As this book persuasively argues, the defining hallmark of Einstein s genius was not any special mathematical ability but an uncanny talent to use his mistakes as stepping stones to formulate his revolutionary theories.

LINQ is the project name for a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that provide a generic approach to querying data from different data sources. LINQ made its debut in Visual Studio 2008, and became a must-have skill for .NET developers. For more information about LINQ, you can check out www.linqdev.com.Starting with code and ending with code and tailored for the VB language, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in VB 2008 is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples that will save you hours, even days, of research time. Keeping you focused on the relevant LINQ principles, expert author Joseph Rattz, Jr.,  and VB specialist Dennis Hayes provide examples for complex models that you won't find anywhere else.In most books, you'll find plenty of simple examples to demonstrate how to use a method, but authors rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in VB 2008 is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and protoypes, Joseph Rattz, Jr., and Dennis Hayes condense their extensive experience and expertise into a desk companion that is essential for any serious .NET professional.Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, this book cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold.Most books tell you about the simple stuff, while few books warn you of the pitfalls. Where Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in VB 2008 returns your investment is in the hours, and sometimes days, spent by the authors determining why something may not work as expected. Sometimes this results in an innocent-looking paragraph that may take you a minute to read and understand, but took days to research and explain.Face it, most technical books while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, this book will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and VB 2008.

The Gal獺pagos Islands are a paradise for birders, botanists, geologists, and snorkelers, with many islands still devoid of human habitation. Since they lie more than 600 miles west of South America and were never connected to the mainland, almost all plant and animal life arrived here by chance. As Charles Darwin discovered, the evolution of plants and animals is more visible here than anywhere else on earth. John Kricher, a renowned ecologist and Gal獺pagos ecotour guide, presents a detailed natural history of this spectacular archipelago. He looks at the amazing diversity of life found here, from iguanas to penguins, and explains the fascinating geology of these remote islands. Throughout his narrative, Kricher weaves the intriguing history of evolutionary biology that is intimately connected with the islands, and describes Darwin's adventures and observations while he was visiting in 1835. Indeed, Kricher takes his chapter titles from comments scattered throughout Darwin's account of his expedition around the world, The Voyage of the Beagle. Kricher closes his book by assessing the conservation efforts to preserve the Gal獺pagos--and the challenges these efforts have met. Of special interest is the book's richly detailed island-by-island guide. For both the ecotraveler and the nature enthusiast, Gal獺pagos is essential reading.

'Einstein did not attempt to explain the constancy of the velocity of light: he assumed it and derived his theories accordingly. But we have explained it.'from Chapter 8 of Space and Counterspace Many people feel alienated by modern science and its impersonal view of our world, based on the concept of the 'detached observer'. Our human intuitions suggest that we need a broader-based science which can encompass phenomena currently excluded, such as human consciousness, qualities and values. In this groundbreaking book, Nick Thomas presents a wider view of science using the theory of 'counterspace'. Counterspace exists alongside space as we know it, and was first proposed by Rudolf Steiner, and developed by the Cambridge mathematician George Adams. Through its startling lens, key aspects of our world -- such as gravity, time, light and color, as well as the stars, the solar system, and the classical elements -- can be viewed and understood in dynamically new ways. Thomas's work and ideas are on the cusp of a true revolution in the way modern scientific method can penetrate even deeper into the mysteries of our natural world.

The author has fished with flies all over the world. His knowledge of the art and sport of catching trout with feathered imitations of native insects has been imparted to countless students in his annual Fly-Fishing Basics classes since 1978. But this book far surpasses Black's experience on the rivers and streams he has fished.There is evidence that men have been fooling fish with fake flies for over 700 years, possibly much longer, going back to China and Macedonia and Rome. The first fly-fishing book, written in the early years of the fifteenth century but not published until 1496, was for many years attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, an English nun born some years before that. Subsequent evidence shows that she may not have been the author of the Treatise of Fishing with an Angle. The true author is unknown, but the dictates of the book have lived on ever since in the ever-present activity of fly-fishing's devotees.Black gathers the stories of numerous historical characters, many of them English aristocrats, who have adhered to the traditional requirement that flies should be modeled on the flying insects that land on the water's surface, rather than nymphs, the immature form of the floating insect. Gentlemen only fished for rising fish lured by a fleeting food source.While both techniques are now equally fascinating to gentlemen (and ladies), the debate between those who prefer dry flies to wet continues to this day.

Humans and snakes have an intimate and ancient relationship that often revolves around either love or hate. Snakes can be seen as gods, spiritual messengers, symbols of fertility, and guardians of resources in virtually all cultures. But to those that fear them, snakes are seen as venomous creatures that cannot be trusted. In Secrets of the Snake Charmer, John Murphy, a research associate of the Division of Amphibians and Reptiles in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, provides an in-depth, twenty-first century look at snakes utilizing the published research of other herpetologists as well as his own personal experiences and speculations. Murphy covers a wide range of topics such as the adaptability of snakes, the ways in which evolution has tinkered with snakes during the last 160 million years, and the impact snakes have on the ecological communities they live in. While sharing ideas about the origin of snakes, rattlesnake rattles, and spitting in cobras, Murphy presents an innovative portrayal of snakes that proves they co-evolve with their prey, predators, and parasites in order to fulfill a significant and novel role in the web of life.

Its easy-to-read treatment offers an intuitive approach, featuring informal discussions followed by thematically arranged exercises. Intended for undergraduate courses in abstract algebra, it is suitable for junior- and senior-level math majors and future math teachers. This second edition features additional exercises to improve student familiarity with applications. An introductory chapter traces concepts of abstract algebra from their historical roots. Succeeding chapters avoid the conventional format of definition-theorem-proof-corollary-example; instead, they take the form of a discussion with students, focusing on explanations and offering motivation. Each chapter rests upon a central theme, usually a specific application or use. The author provides elementary background as needed and discusses standard topics in their usual order. He introduces many advanced and peripheral subjects in the plentiful exercises, which are accompanied by ample instruction and commentary and offer a wide range of experiences to students at different levels of ability.

LINQ is the project name for a set of extensions to the .NET Framework that provide a generic approach to querying data from different data sources. LINQ will premier in Visual Studio 2008, and will become the next must-have skill for .NET developers. For more information about LINQ, you can check out the author's portal at www.LINQdev.com.Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 is all about code.Literally, this book starts with code and ends with code. In most books, the author shows the simplest example demonstrating how to use a method, but they so rarely show how to use the more complex prototypes. Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 is different. Demonstrating the overwhelming majority of LINQ operators and protoypes, it is a veritable treasury of LINQ examples.Rather than obscure the relevant LINQ principles in code examples by focusing on a demonstration application you have no interest in writing, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 cuts right to the chase of each LINQ operator, method, or class. However, where complexity is necessary to truly demonstrate an issue, the examples are right there in the thick of it. For example, code samples demonstrating how to handle concurrency conflicts actually create concurrency conflicts so you can step through the code and see them unfold.Most books tell you about the simple stuff, while few books warn you of the pitfalls. Where Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 returns your investment is in the hours, and sometimes days, spent by the author determining why something may not work as expected. Sometimes this results in an innocent looking paragraph that may take you a minute to read and understand, but took days to research and explain.Face it, most technical books while informative, are dull. LINQ need not be dull. Written with a sense of humor, Pro LINQ: Language Integrated Query in C# 2008 will attempt to entertain you on your journey through the wonderland of LINQ and C# 2008.

In this thesis the growth-dependency of head-related transfer functions and their resulting parameters (interaural time and level differences) are analyzed as well as ear canal impedances. Differences in the anatomy of children and adults result in different binaural cues. The individual anthropometric parameters, however, affect the binaural cues to a varying extent. In this thesis the most important anthropometric parameter with regard to their influence on binaural cues, are determined. Ear canal impedances are undergoing certain changes as well while children are growing up and finally reach adulthood. This thesis presents for the first time, the age-related development of data that is most decisive for the impedances. These new findings open up new possibilities to develop artificial child heads and couplers for hearing aids that are suitable for children. Thus, improvements in certain fields of applications such as the development and fitting of hearing aids for children are now possible and measurement techniques that are used for classroom acoustics can now be optimized significantly as well. Moreover, these new findings are vital when it comes to re-evaluating standardized artificial heads.

Global warming"": the Left's last best chance to gain a stranglehold on our political system and economy For decades, environmentalism has been the Left's best excuse for increasing government control over our actions in ways both large and small. It's for Mother Earth! It's for the children! It's for the whales! But until now, the doomsday-scenario environmental scares they've trumped up haven't been large enough to justify the lifestyle restrictions they want to impose. With global warming, however, greenhouse gasbags can argue that auto emissions in Ohio threaten people in Paris, and that only ""global governance"" (Jacques Chirac's words) can tackle such problems. Now, in The Politically Incorrect Guide(tm) to Global Warming and Environmentalism, Christopher C. Horner tears the cover off the Left's manipulation of environmental issues for political purposes--and lays out incontrovertible evidence for the fact that catastrophic man-made global warming is just more Chicken-Little hysteria, not actual science. He explains why, although Al Gore and his cronies among the media elites and UN globalists endlessly bleat that ""global warming"" is an unprecedented global crisis, they really think of it as a dream come true. It's the ideal scare campaign for those who hate capitalism and love big government. For, as Horner explains, if global warming really were as bad as the Leftist doomsayers insist it is, then no policy imaginable could ""solve"" it. According to the logic of the greens' own numbers, no matter how much we sacrifice there would still be more to do. That makes global warming the bottomless well of excuses for the relentless growth of big government. Horner (an attorney and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute) reveals the full anti-American, anti-capitalist, and anti-human agenda of today's environmentalists, dubbing them ""green on the outside, red to the core."" He details how they use strong-arm legal tactics--and worse--against those who dare to point out the weakness of their arguments for global warming. Along the way, he explodes ten top global warming myths, carefully examining the evidence to determine how much warming there really is and what is actually causing it. He exposes the lies that the environmental lobby routinely tells to make its case; the ways in which it is trying to impose initiatives such as the Kyoto Protocol on an unwilling American public; and much more--including the green lobby's favorite politicians (John Kerry, John McCain, Joe Lieberman, and others). It's time to stand up to the environmentalist industry and insist: human beings are not the enemy. In breezy, light-hearted, and always entertaining fashion, The Politically Incorrect Guide(tm) to Global Warming and Environmentalism gives you the facts you need to do so.

Evolution is a fundamental process that cuts across boundaries of art and science and has beguiled thinkers for ages. This collection of articles about all aspects of evolution is a feast of challenging ideas, drawing together world-renowned thinkers and communicators with their own intriguing insights. This impressive cast of contributors takes on such questions as: Why and how do civilizations and societies change over time? Why do our cells develop the way they do? Why are some villages still villages while others have grown into vast cities? Can we learn from our evolutionary past to plan a better future for our health and society? Tracing the history of biological evolution, through the evolution of cultures, society, science and the universe, contributors such as Stephen Jay Gould, Freeman Dyson, and Martin Rees address these mysteries by considering parallels from all levels of life. From the evolution of the embryo to the evolution of a star, common threads emerge to tell a fascinating story with surprising implications.

The original Handbook of Surface and Interface Analysis: Methods for Problem-Solving was based on the authors' firm belief that characterization and analysis of surfaces should be conducted in the context of problem solving and not be based on the capabilities of any individual technique. Now, a decade later, trends in science and technology appear to have validated their assertions.  Major instrumental assets are generally funded and maintained as central facilities to help potential users make informed decisions about their appropriate use in solving analytical problem(s). Building on the popular first edition, this long-awaited second edition was motivated by the increasingly common industry view that it is more cost-effective to contract out analytical services than to maintain in-house facilities. Guided by that trend, this book focuses on developing strategic thinking for those who decide which facilities to access and where to subcontract analytical work. It covers most of the major tactical issues that are relevant at the location in which data are being produced.  New Information in this Second Edition Includes:    Electron-optical imaging techniques and associated analytical methods   Techniques based on synchrotron sources   Convenient and versatile scanning probe group methods   Scanning tunneling microscopy, biocompatible materials, and nano-structured materials  Assessing benefits and limitations of different methodologies, this volume provides the essential physical basis and common modes of operation for groups of techniques. Exploring methods for characterization and analysis of particular types of materials and/or their relevant applications-the text synergizes traditional and novel ideas to help readers develop a versatile and rational approach to surface and interface analysis.

世界金融危機爆發，給全球經濟帶來了巨大的負面影響。美國現行的所有政策，正在不可避免地把全球帶入下一輪惡性通脹。由於許多國家都長期持有大量美元作為儲備貨幣，要應付金融危機，美國惟一的辦法是大印美鈔，相當於稀釋所有美元持有者的財富，充當美國經濟復甦的鋪路石。我們觀察2008以來的走勢不難看出，黃金行情一路上揚從850美元漲到了現在的1500美元，USDJPY從110日元跌倒現在80日元，美元兌人民幣匯率也從7.5元跌倒6.45元。與股票、期貨不同，外匯是一個24小時不停歇的國際市場，交投十分活躍，交易量十分巨大，一天有4萬億美元的成交量。這樣幾個特點不難看出外匯市場幾乎不可能被某個財團操縱，受某個國家經濟政策的影響也非常小，我們聽說過某某基金組織操縱了股市，甚至操縱了某地區的金融市場，還帶來了金融風暴嚴重夠過，但我們絕對沒聽說過某財團組織操縱外匯市場的傳聞，由此，我們得出了一個結論：外匯行情最適合用技術分析手段來把握。二十四小時盯盤，不停地做行情分析，頻繁地進行交易，你是個鐵人都會有倒下的時候，要知道炒外匯不是我們生活的全部，我們有權利去享受炒外匯以外的更多的生活樂趣，精通智慧交易系統程式編寫，善於使用智慧交易系統程式，就能為你爭取到更多的時間和精力。此書整理了一些針對MT4平臺的豐富圖文教程，不要被外界的傳聞嚇到自己，更不要自己勸退了自己，因為你來學習這門技術的目的是為了能更好的享受生活！因此，我們能很肯定的說，當你一輩子只需寫出三隻完美程式，就別再錯過你與本書的第一次邂逅。

Despite the continuing popularity of egalitarian values and rhetoric, the brute facts of poverty and massive inequality remain everywhere with us. Although extreme poverty and deprivation are often associated with developing societies, recent years have witnessed rising inequality in many industrialized countries as well. If inequality persists in modern societies, however, its patterns and structures are evolving in complex ways that defy generalizations from historical experience.

An intriguing work of history, philosophy, and popular science that explores the human desire to quest. Scientists continually look for the genetic factors that make humans so very different in appearance and behaviour from most animals - the genes that are uniquely human. Respected biochemist and author Charles Pasternak argues that such genes do not exist. Instead, he suggests that it is our desire to quest - for food and shelter, for knowledge, for wealth, for adventure - coupled with our unique physical abilities to do so that have controlled our evolution and have led humans to develop away from closely related animals. In this intriguing work of history, philosophy, and popular science, Pasternak uses his extensive biological knowledge to discuss man's nature and achievements, his genetic makeup, and his evolution.

""Ryan Barnett has raised the bar in terms of running Apache securely. If you run Apache, stop right now and leaf through this book; you need this information."" -- Stephen Northcutt, The SANS Institute The only end-to-end guide to securing Apache Web servers and Web applications Apache can be hacked. As companies have improved perimeter security, hackers have increasingly focused on attacking Apache Web servers and Web applications. Firewalls and SSL won't protect you: you must systematically harden your Web application environment. Preventing Web Attacks with Apache brings together all the information you'll need to do that: step-by-step guidance, hands-on examples, and tested configuration files. Building on his groundbreaking SANS presentations on Apache security, Ryan C. Barnett reveals why your Web servers represent such a compelling target, how significant exploits are performed, and how they can be defended against. Exploits discussed include: buffer overflows, denial of service, attacks on vulnerable scripts and programs, credential sniffing and spoofing, client parameter manipulation, brute force attacks, web defacements, and more. Barnett introduces the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmarks, a set of best-practice Apache security configuration actions and settings he helped to create. He addresses issues related to IT processes and your underlying OS; Apache downloading, installation, and configuration; application hardening; monitoring, and more. He also presents a chapter-length case study using actual Web attack logs and data captured ""in the wild."" For every sysadmin, Web professional, and security specialist responsible for Apache or Web application security. With this book, you will learn to * Address the OS-related flaws most likely to compromise Web server security * Perform security-related tasks needed to safely download, configure, and install Apache * Lock down your Apache httpd.conf file and install

Food and agriculture are in the news daily. Stories in the media highlight issues of abundance, deprivation, pleasure, risk, health, community, and identity. Remaking the North American Food System examines the resurgence of interest in rebuilding the links between agricultural production and food consumption as a way to overcome some of the negative implications of industrial and globalizing trends in the food and agricultural system. Written by a diverse group of scholars and practitioners, the chapters in this volume describe the many efforts throughout North America to craft and sustain alternative food systems that can improve social, economic, environmental, and health outcomes. With examples from Puerto Rico to Oregon to Quebec, this volume offers a broad North American perspective attuned to trends toward globalization at the level of markets and governance and shows how globalization affects the specific localities. The contributors make the case that food can no longer be taken for granted or viewed in isolation. Rather, food should be considered in its connection to community vitality, cultural survival, economic development, social justice, environmental quality, ecological integrity, and human health. C. Clare Hinrichs, an associate professor of rural sociology at Pennsylvania State University, has published numerous articles on rural sociology and agriculture. Thomas A. Lyson (1948-2006) was the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Development Sociology and director of the Community, Food, and Agriculture Program at Cornell University. He is the author of Civic Agriculture: Reconnecting Farm, Food, and Community. Contributors: Elizabeth Barham, Jim Bingen, Troy C.

This classic volume presents the design, application, and analysis of pressure-transient tests as a means of obtaining reliable information about reservoir and well conditions. Advances in Well Test Analysis can be used for most well-test analysis situations without requiring other material. More than 50 examples are included to illustrate analysis techniques presented, as well as to emphasize practical problems that arise in well-test analysis. Includes packet of enlarged type curves to assist the engineer in actual analysis. The subject of the monograph is broad and general and difficult to define concisely. The mission of this book is to present a valid and useful range of information rather than a completely comprehensive treatment. Many available testing and analysis techniques are referenced, while only the essence of others is presented. The goal is to provide information that can be used readily for practical and real problems.

Quantum Theory is the most revolutionary discovery in physics since Newton. This book gives a lucid, exciting, and accessible account of the surprising and counterintuitive ideas that shape our understanding of the sub-atomic world. It does not disguise the problems of interpretation that still remain unsettled 75 years after the initial discoveries. The main text makes no use of equations, but there is a Mathematical Appendix for those desiring stronger fare. Uncertainty, probabilistic physics, complementarity, the problematic character of measurement, and decoherence are among the many topics discussed. This volume offers the reader access to one of the greatest discoveries in the history of physics and one of the outstanding intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style,  Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.

Einstein's Enigma or Black Holes in My Bubble Bath is a humourous and informal rendition of the story of gravitation theory from the early historic origins to the latest developments in astrophysics, focusing on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity and black-hole physics. Through engaging conversations and napkin-scribbled diagrams come tumbling the rudiments of relativity, spacetime and much of modern physics, narrated with high didactic and literary talent, and each embedded in casual lessons given by a worldly astrophysicist to his friend. Join the intellectual fun and exalt in the frothy ideas while vicariously taking relaxing baths in this magical bathtub. Prof. C.V. Vishveshwara is a renowned theoretical physicist, who participated in the golden age of black-hole physics, making pioneering contributions. Also an enthusiastic teacher and planetarium director, he has written several popular-level articles, scripts for planetarium shows and produced documentary movies on science. Advance Praise for ""Einstein's Enigma or Black Holes in My Bubble Bath""  ""Beautifully written and thoroughly entertaining, Vishveshwara's ""Einstein's Enigma"" provides an authoritative but distinctly original approach to an explanation of basics and subtleties of Einstein's general relativity and of the astrophysics of black holes. I warmly recommend it to beginner and expert alike."" Prof. Roger Penrose, author of Shadows of the Mind and The Road to Reality  ""The main dish in this feast is a clear and sound presentation of the science underlying black holes from a distinguished scientist who has been contributing to their study since before they were named. Furthermore this science is presented in a sauce of philosophy, history, literature, gastronomy and imagination from an entertaining personality who needs several alter egos to show all the different ways he can think about his subject. Among the cartoons and drawings are the few lines of optional mathematics which are included for those who like that approach."" Prof. Charles W. Misner, co-author of Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler ""The unusual format and whimsical style of ""Einstein's Enigma"" should not obscure the fact that this is a serious book, which aims to get across the essentials of the theory of general relativity and some related topics to a readership which is not assumed to be fluent in advanced mathematics.I believe the author, who has a long experience in presenting this kind of material to non-specialist audiences, has succeeded in the task he has set himself; the book will amply repay sustained and diligent reading by even a totally unmathematical reader.""

Oracle designed its database products to be flexible and configurable so they would operate on a variety of hardware platforms, and they succeeded--Oracle software runs on more than seventy computer platforms, from mainframes to PC networks to handheld PDAs. The secret to this flexibility lies in the software's initialization parameters, whose numerous settings can be configured for top performance in countless environments. On the downside, however, improper settings can slow a system down; even grind it to a halt. And with so many parameters--which change from version to version of Oracle software--it's challenging for Oracle administrators to keep in mind the characteristics and optimal settings for each parameter. The Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference provides the crucial information you need to make key adjustments to your Oracle database. This concise guide is a mix of invaluable performance tips and a quick reference to Oracle's initialization parameters. The book describes each initialization parameter, indicates what category it's in--from auditing to multi-threaded server MTS--and whether it can be modified dynamically via the ALTER SESSION or ALTER SYSTEM command.  In addition to the details about parameter characteristics and settings, you'll find performance tips, such as how the various parameters interact, and what the most advantageous settings are for different configurations. No other reference focuses exclusively on these initialization parameters--an absolute must for anyone working with an Oracle database.  Presented in a handy, easy-to-use format, the Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference is a welcome alternative for anyone who's struggled to memorize the best configuration settings or gone back and forth to online resources, trying to figure out what works. O'Reilly's Pocket References put the information you need close at hand where you need it most. This guide will keep your Oracle databases operating at peak performance.

Alchemy, whose beginnings -- possibly in Egypt, Babylon, India, or China -- are ancient and obscure, remained undocumented until about 2500 BC. Although it may have originated with metallurgy, the practice rapidly developed an association with magic, pharmacy, and astrology. In this richly illustrated and amply researched study, a noted expert traces the long history of alchemy, from its murky start to modern times. Hermes Trismegistus and other famous alchemists appear here, along with discussions of the craft's associations with chicanery (as memorably portrayed in Ben Jonson's 1610 comedy, The Alchemist), and its role in the secret society of Rosicrucians. Additional topics include the alchemist's laboratory and equipment, alchemical symbols and secret alphabets, noteworthy manuscripts, the influence of astrology, and more. Although regarded today as a pseudoscience, alchemy gave rise to scientific chemistry. This volume illustrates the ways in which efforts to transmute metals -- such as the search for the ever-elusive philosopher's stone -- stimulated experimentation with hitherto untried substances, leading to improved knowledge of the materials vital to applied chemistry. Anyone intrigued by the origins and practices of this age-old and still-mysterious discipline, as well as those interested in the history of chemistry, will appreciate this concise, authoritative study.

Deterministic Methods in Systems Hydrology presents the basic theory underlying the multitude of parameter-rich models which dominate the hydrological literature. Its objectives are to introduce the elements of systems science as applied to hydrological problems; to present flood prediction and flood routing as problems in linear systems theory, clarifying the basic assumptions and evaluating their accuracy; and to review and to evaluate some deterministic models of components of the hydrological cycle, with a view to assembling the most appropriate model of catchment response, for a particular problem in applied hydrology. The material is developed in two parts: the first four chapters present the systems viewpoint, the nature of hydrological systems, some systems mathematics and their application to direct storm runoff. The final four chapters cover linear conceptual models of direct runoff, the fitting of conceptual models to data, simple models of subsurface flow and non-linear deterministic models.

Though James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is best remembered for his epochal achievements in electricity and magnetism, he was wide-ranging in his scientific investigations, and he came to brilliant conclusions in virtually all of them. As James R. Newman put it, Maxwell ""combined a profound physical intuition, an exquisite feeling for the relationship of objects, with a formidable mathematical capacity to establish orderly connections among diverse phenomena. This blending of the concrete and the abstract was the chief characteristic of almost all his researches.""Maxwell's work on heat and statistical physics has long been recognized as vitally important, but Theory of Heat,  his own masterful presentation of his ideas, remained out of print for years before being brought back in this new edition. In this unjustly neglected classic, Maxwell sets forth the fundamentals of thermodynamics clearly and simply enough to be understood by a beginning student, yet with enough subtlety and depth of thought to appeal also to more advanced readers. He goes on to elucidate the fundamental ideas of kinetic theory, and -- through the mental experiment of ""Maxwell's demon"" -- points out how the Second Law of Thermodynamics relies on statistics.A new Introduction and notes by Peter Pesic put Maxwell's work into context and show how it relates to the quantum ideas that emerged a few years later. Theory of Heat will serve beginners as a sound introduction to thermal physics; advanced students of physics and the history of science will find Maxwell's ideas stimulating, and will be delighted to discover this inexpensive reprint of a long-unavailable classic.

This third edition updates and expands the material presented in the best-selling first and second editions of Basic Hazardous Waste Management. It covers health and safety issues affecting hazardous waste workers, management and regulation of radioactive and biomedical/infectious wastes, as well as current trends in technologies. While the topics have been completely revised, the author employs the same practical approach that made the previous editions so popular. Chapters are structured to first outline the issue, subject, or technology, then to describe generic practice, and then to conclude with a summary of the statutory or regulatory approach. Blackman introduces fundamental issues such as human health hazards; the environmental impacts of toxic, reactive, and ignitable materials; the mobility, pathways and fates of released hazardous materials; and the roles of science, technology, and risk assessment in the standards-setting process. He explores hazardous waste site remediation technology, and the application of federal statutes, regulations, programs, and policies to the cleanup of contaminated sites. This text provides an introductory framework-which can serve as the foundation for a program of study in traditional as well as modern hazardous waste management-or a component of a related program. Its overview format provides numerous references to more detailed materials to assist the student or instructor in expansion on specific topics.

Invasive species--those nonnative organisms that aggressively spread into the landscape--are widely recognized as major threats to biological diversity, second only to direct habitat loss. This book provides specific information about the biology and control of the 78 nonnative plant species that are listed by the California Exotic Pest Plant Council (CalEPPC) as being of greatest ecological concern in California. The heart of the book consists of species accounts, each description illustrated with a close-up photo, a habitat photo, and line drawings showing details to aid identification. The text addresses the following questions about each speices: How do I recognize it? Where would I find it? Where did it come from and how does it spread? What problems does it cause? How does it grow and reproduce? How can I get rid of it? Many invasives can be halted or slowed, and in certain circumstances even badly infested areas can be restored. With the help of this book, land managers, volunteer stewards, conservationists, and others concerned with wildlands in the western United States can better understand invasive plants and help combat the damage they do.

An elegant, witty, and engaging exploration of the riddle of time, which examines the consequences of Einstein's theory of relativity and offers startling suggestions about what recent research may reveal.  The eternal questions of science and religion were profoundly recast by Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications that time can be warped by motion and gravitation, and that it cannot be meaningfully divided into past, present, and future.  In About Time,  Paul Davies discusses the big bang theory, chaos theory, and the recent discovery that the universe appears to be younger than some of the objects in it, concluding that Einstein's theory provides only an incomplete understanding of the nature of time. Davies explores unanswered questions such as:  * Does the universe have a beginning and an end? * Is the passage of time merely an illusion? * Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time?  About Time weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.

An adventure into the heart of Nothing by bestselling author K. C. Cole. Once again, acclaimed science writer K. C. Cole brings the arcane and acad-emic down to the level of armchair scientists in The Hole in the Universe, an entertaining and edifying search for nothing at all. Open the newspaper on any given day and you will read of a newly discovered planet, star, and so on. Yet scientists and mathematicians have spent generations searching the far reaches of the universe for that one elusive state-nothingness. Although this may sound like a simple task, every time the absolute void appears within reach, something new is discovered in its place: a black hole, an undulating string, an additional dimension of space or time-even another universe. A fascinating and literary tour de force, The Hole in the Universe is a virtual romp into the unknown that you never knew wasn't there.

Ragnarok. Armageddon. Doomsday. Since the dawn of time, man has wondered how the world would end. In The Last Three Minutes,  Paul Davies reveals the latest theories. It might end in a whimper, slowly scattering into the infinite void. Then again, it might be yanked back by its own gravity and end in a catastrophic ""Big Crunch."" There are other, more frightening possibilities. We may be seconds away from doom at this very moment.Written in clear language that makes the cutting-edge science of quarks, neutrinos, wormholes, and metaverses accessible to the layman, The Last Three Minutes treats readers to a wide range of conjectures about the ultimate fate of the universe. Along the way, it takes the occasional divergent path to discuss some slightly less cataclysmic topics such as galactic colonization, what would happen if the Earth were struck by the comet Swift-Tuttle (a distinct possibility), the effects of falling in a black hole, and how to create a ""baby universe."" Wonderfully morbid to the core, this is one of the most original science books to come along in years.

Ferns are usually thought of as plants of moist, humid regions, and at first glance the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, a rugged portion of the arid Chihuahuan Desert, does not appear to be a likely location for ferns and their relatives. Yet in many seemingly unsuitable dry habitats, on shadowed slopes, in canyons, and near springs, seeps, and streams can be found sixty-four species of ferns and fourteen species of fern allies. This book is a complete review of the true ferns as well as the related spikemosses and scouring rushes of the Trans-Pecos. In a concise, readable introduction, the authors describe the region, which ranges in topography from desert floors to mountain peaks of over eight thousand feet, and the variations in climate and soils that allow ferns to survive in specific habitats. In clear language they describe the morphology, reproduction, and adaptability of ferns and fern allies. Detailed keys to the Trans-Pecos families, genera, and species allow anyone to identify an unknown fern from the region. The species descriptions give full scientific names, common names, synonyms, and descriptions of locations where the fern can be found, including specific information on their occurrence in Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains National Parks. Wherever necessary, the species descriptions provide information on species that may be confused. Other features of the book are a quick identification guide, a checklist of the ferns and fern allies of the region, a glossary of terms, and a list of references. The book is illustrated with detailed line drawings of the habit and details of the plants, and distribution maps with each fern's description show where the species can be located in the region. This book will be a valuable guide for anyone interested in the plant life of far western Texas and adjacent areas in the Chihuahuan Desert.

Historians have long recognized that the rebirth of science in twelfth-century Europe flowed from a search for ancient scientific texts. But this search presupposes knowledge and interest; we only seek what we know to be valuable. The emergence of scholarly interest after centuries of apparent stagnation seems paradoxical. This book resolves that seeming contradiction by describing four active traditions of early medieval astronomy: one divided the year by observing the Sun; another computed the date of Easter Full Moon; the third determined the time for monastic prayers by watching the course of the stars; and the classical tradition of geometrical astronomy provided a framework for the cosmos. Most of these astronomies were practical; they sustained the communities in which they flourished and reflected and reinforced the values of those communities. These astronomical traditions motivated the search for ancient learning that led to the Scientific Renaissance of the twelfth century.

A charming, entertaining, and instructive book .... The writing is exceptionally lucid, as in the author's earlier books, ... and the problems carefully selected for maximum interest and elegance. -- Martin Gardner.This book is intended for people who liked geometry when they first encountered it (and perhaps even some who did not) but sensed a lack of intellectual stimulus and wondered what was missing, or felt that the play was ending just when the plot was finally becoming interesting.In this superb treatment, Professor Ogilvy demonstrates the mathematical challenge and satisfaction to be had from geometry, the only requirements being two simple implements (straightedge and compass) and a little thought. Avoiding topics that require an array of new definitions and abstractions, Professor Ogilvy draws upon material that is either self-evident in the classical sense or very easy to prove. Among the subjects treated are: harmonic division and Apollonian circles, inversion geometry, the hexlet, conic sections, projective geometry, the golden section, and angle trisection. Also included are some unsolved problems of modern geometry, including Malfatti's problem and the Kakeya problem.Numerous diagrams, selected references, and carefully chosen problems enhance the text. In addition, the helpful section of notes at the back provides not only source references but also much other material highly useful as a running commentary on the text.

Topology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of mathematical thought: while its roots are in geometry and analysis, topology now serves as a powerful tool in almost every sphere of mathematical study. This book is intended as a first text in topology, accessible to readers with at least three semesters of a calculus and analytic geometry sequence.In addition to superb coverage of the fundamentals of metric spaces, topologies, convergence, compactness, connectedness, homotopy theory, and other essentials, Elementary Topology gives added perspective as the author demonstrates how abstract topological notions developed from classical mathematics. For this second edition, numerous exercises have been added as well as a section dealing with paracompactness and complete regularity. The Appendix on infinite products has been extended to include the general Tychonoff theorem; a proof of the Tychonoff theorem which does not depend on the theory of convergence has also been added in Chapter 7.

The authors use an informal but highly effective writing style to present a uniform and consistent treatment of the subject matter. -- Journal of Chemical Education.The primary focus of this text is to introduce students to vibrational and electronic spectroscopy, presenting applications of group theory to the interpretation of UV, visible, and infrared spectra without assuming a high level of background knowledge. The text is divided into five chapters that address the fundamentals of group theory, qualitative aspects of quantum mechanics, vibrational spectroscopy, molecular orbital theory, and electronic spectroscopy. To make the exposition clear and meaningful, each new concept is applied or illustrated with experimental results as quickly as possible. In addition, each chapter features a large number of relevant problems through which students can test their understanding of text material. These problems are an integral part of the text and sometimes introduce new material. Solutions to the problems (often accompanied by detailed explanations) can be found in an appendix.Carefully written to provide a solid foundation in spectroscopic analysis, the book devotes significant attention to the interpretation and significance of vibrational and electronic spectra, including good introductory material on Raman and photo-electron spectroscopy, vibronic analysis, and transition metal complexes. Moreover, many of the concepts presented clearly here can be easily extended to studies in other fields of chemistry. Also included are numerous helpful figures and line drawings illustrating important concepts.

The application of statistical methods in mass production make possible the most efficient use of raw materials and manufacturing processes, economical production, and the highest standards of quality for manufactured goods. In this classic volume, based on a series of ground-breaking lectures given to the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture in 1938, Dr. Shewhart illuminated the fundamental principles and techniques basic to the efficient use of statistical method in attaining statistical control, establishing tolerance limits, presenting data, and specifying accuracy and precision.In the first chapter, devoted to statistical control, the author broadly defines the three steps in quality control: specification, production, and inspection; then outlines the historical background of quality control. This is followed by a rigorous discussion of the physical and mathematical states of statistical control, statistical control as an operation, the significance of statistical control and the future of statistics in mass production.Chapter II offers a thought-provoking treatment of the problem of establishing limits of variability, including the meaning of tolerance limits, establishing tolerance limits in the simplest cases and in practical cases, and standard methods of measuring. Chapter III explores the presentation of measurements of physical properties and constants. Among the topics considered are measurements presented as original data, characteristics of original data, summarizing original data (both by symmetric functions and by Tchebycheff's theorem), measurement presented as meaningful predictions, and measurement presented as knowledge.Finally, Dr. Shewhart deals with the problem of specifying accuracy and precision -- the meaning of accuracy and precision, operational meaning, verifiable procedures, minimum quantity of evidence needed for forming a judgment and more.Now available for the first time in this inexpensive paperbound format, this highly respected study will be welcomed by mathematics students, engineers, researchers in industry and agriculture -- anyone in need of a lucid, well-written explanation of how to regulate variable and maintain control over statistics in order to achieve quality control over manufactured products, crops, and data.

Clearly developed from first principles, this introductory study supplies basic material on electrostatics and magnetostatics, then concentrates on electromagnetic theory -- the authors are both leading men in the field. The book ranges freely over many areas of electromagnetic theory with some concern for electrical engineering. It covers the field theory of electromagnetism, electrostatics and the equations and theorems of Gauss, Poisson, Laplace and Green, solutions of Laplace's equation, dielectrics, magnetic fields of linear and circular currents, electromagnetic induction and Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, electron theory, wave guides and cavity resonators, spherical electromagnetic waves, Huygen's principle and Green's theorem, and Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. Practice problems are supplied at chapter ends.Physicists and engineers will find this presentation particularly useful; but mathematicians have also used the book not only as an introduction to electromagnetism, but also as a means to an increased knowledge of the aims and tools of theoretical physics. The only background required to follow the development is a knowledge of the calculus and differential equations. More advanced mathematics is developed in appendixes.

This book has been widely acclaimed for its clear, cogent presentation of the theory of partial differential equations, and the incisive application of its principal topics to commonly encountered problems in the physical sciences and engineering. It was developed and tested at Purdue University over a period of five years in classes for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences.The book begins with a short review of calculus and ordinary differential equations, then moves on to explore integral curves and surfaces of vector fields, quasi-linear and linear equations of first order, series solutions and the Cauchy Kovalevsky theorem. It then delves into linear partial differential equations, examines the Laplace, wave and heat equations, and concludes with a brief treatment of hyperbolic systems of equations.Among the most important features of the text are the challenging problems at the end of each section which require a wide variety of responses from students, from providing details of the derivation of an item presented to solving specific problems associated with partial differential equations. Requiring only a modest mathematical background, the text will be indispensable to those who need to use partial differential equations in solving physical problems. It will provide as well the mathematical fundamentals for those who intend to pursue the study of more advanced topics, including modern theory.

A must for researchers using the techniques of light scattering. ― S. C. Snowdon, Journal of the Franklin InstituteThe measurement of light scattering of independent, homogeneous particles has many useful applications in physical chemistry, meteorology and astronomy. There is, however, a sizeable gap between the abstract formulae related to electromagnetic-wave-scattering phenomena, and the computation of reliable figures and curves. Dr. van de Hulst's book enables researchers to bridge that gap. The product of twelve years of work, it is an exhaustive study of light-scattering properties of small, individual particles, and includes a survey of all the relevant literature.Beginning with a broad overview of basic scattering theory, Dr. van de Hulst covers the conservation of energy and momentum; wave propagation in vacuum and in a medium containing scatterers; and polarized light and symmetry relations. The heart of the book is devoted to the rigorous scattering theory for spheres of arbitrary size (Mie theory) and to various modes of approximation such as the Rayleigh-Gaas approximation, the perfect reflection approximation, the geometrical-optics approximation, and others. Methods of computation are given with respect to different kinds of particles, bodies and phenomena: particles small or very large compared to the wavelength, absorbing and nonabsorbing spheres, water drops, circular cylinders, edge phenomena and surface waves, and many others. In the last part, the author covers the use of scattering and extinction experiments as a practical tool, including applications in chemistry, meteorology and astronomy.This book's comprehensive, lucid coverage of the field makes it a valuable source for all those interested in light-scattering theory. It is absolutely essential for researchers needing to employ light-scattering measurements, and its republication will be welcomed especially by those who have found this necessary source difficult to obtain. Over 400 references. 46 tables. 59 graphs. Subject and name indexes. 44 illustrations.

Referred to by every later author, used by thousands of students in the over forty years since publication, and recommended with great enthusiasm by those same students who are now professors, The Principles of Statistical Mechanics is widely recognized as the classic treatment of a subject essential to contemporary physics. It is the definitive treatise on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics, and because it deals with the fundamentals, the material is as useful today as forty years ago.After a brief introduction, the text begins with a concise exposition of classical statistical mechanics, including such topics as Hamilton's principle, the Lagrangian function, canonical equations of motion, the fundamental theorem of Liouville, conditions for statistical equilibrium, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law, collisions as a mechanism of change with time, and Boltzmann's H-theorem. There follows a thorough elucidation of quantum statistical mechanics: historical remarks, the postulates, theorems illustrating the nature of quantum mechanics, transformation theory, applications, statistical ensembles, the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Einstein-Bose, and Fermi-Dirac distributions, the change in quantum mechanical systems with time, and the quantum mechanical H-theorem. (The self-contained treatment of quantum mechanics is almost a book within a book!) The final two chapters, illuminating one of the greatest achievements of physics, discuss the application of statistical mechanics to the problem of obtaining a mechanical explanation for the phenomena of thermodynamic behavior.Professor Richard C. Tolman was a distinguished physicist who taught at the California Institute of Technology. In the course of preparing this book he consulted with many eminent colleagues including Pauling, Fowler, and Pauli, and he discussed all parts of the book with J. Robert Oppenheimer. Scholars interested in the history of science can readily appreciate the importance of this book; but since it is so totally authoritative, and so elegantly written, every student and professor of statistical mechanics will find it equally valuable.

This book, for the first time, provides laymen and mathematicians alike with a detailed picture of the historical development of one of the most momentous achievements of the human intellect ― the calculus. It describes with accuracy and perspective the long development of both the integral and the differential calculus from their early beginnings in antiquity to their final emancipation in the 19th century from both physical and metaphysical ideas alike and their final elaboration as mathematical abstractions, as we know them today, defined in terms of formal logic by means of the idea of a limit of an infinite sequence.But while the importance of the calculus and mathematical analysis ― the core of modern mathematics ― cannot be overemphasized, the value of this first comprehensive critical history of the calculus goes far beyond the subject matter. This book will fully counteract the impression of laymen, and of many mathematicians, that the great achievements of mathematics were formulated from the beginning in final form. It will give readers a sense of mathematics not as a technique, but as a habit of mind, and serve to bridge the gap between the sciences and the humanities. It will also make abundantly clear the modern understanding of mathematics by showing in detail how the concepts of the calculus gradually changed from the Greek view of the reality and immanence of mathematics to the revised concept of mathematical rigor developed by the great 19th century mathematicians, which held that any premises were valid so long as they were consistent with one another. It will make clear the ideas contributed by Zeno, Plato, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, the Arabic and Scholastic mathematicians, Newton, Leibnitz, Taylor, Descartes, Euler, Lagrange, Cantor, Weierstrass, and many others in the long passage from the Greek ""method of exhaustion"" and Zeno's paradoxes to the modern concept of the limit independent of sense experience; and illuminate not only the methods of mathematical discovery, but the foundations of mathematical thought as well.
