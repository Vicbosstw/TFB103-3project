The present study developed an autonomous algorithm for the Convective cell Identification and TRAcking (CITRA) using DWR reflectivity images. The CITRA algorithm is implemented in Python using Deep learning technique of Neural Networks. Optical Character Recognition is used in the present study through ""Tesseract"" which is an unsupervised Neural Network module based on LSTM which analyses the input dimensional pixel array/image and outputs high-level strings. The algorithm runs through the DWR reflectivity image pixel values and recognizes the intensities of the pixels (>=30 dB) and segregates convective cells along with other estimated cell properties such as centroid of the storm, the area covered, distance and direction from the radar centre. The performance of CITRA algorithm was tested on different convective storms and it could successfully identify and track them along with other physical properties of the convective cells. Further, we have demonstrated the potential application of CITRA algorithm on the evolution of convective cells detected within the radar range. Presently, CITRA algorithm takes only reflectivity images as a single input parameter.

Road maintenance has traditionally been a time consuming, expensive, and manual process. Timely maintenance of roads helps in lowering rehabilitation costs, accidents, environmental pollution, while facilitating increased connectivity, trade, and growth. Easily acquirable front-view scene images are seen to be used lately for infrastructure management and road maintenance as they provide quicker, low-cost, and flexible solutions. Such scene images can easily be acquired using standard commodity cameras. In this dissertation, machine learning based approaches have been developed to analyze front-view scene images for detecting cracks automatically on road surfaces across different locations and under various conditions. This work thus contributes toward automated approaches to detect different kinds of cracks on road surfaces, thereby proposing a low-cost solution to road maintenance practices. As a result, different components are developed in this work which are sketched together to form a Decision Support System for the task of crack detection. In this study primarily three algorithmic approaches have been developed. Firstly, an unsupervised graph-based hierarchical clustering technique for road area segmentation has been developed, thus helping in detecting the road area in scene images. Secondly, a classifier and superpixel based supervised learning approach consisting of systematically identifying relevant features for detecting superpixels containing cracks has been developed. Thirdly, an unsupervised learning approach consisting of Gamma Mixture Fuzzy Model based clustering technique and keypoint matching mechanisms have been designed in this work for detecting which road pixels are crack pixels in images. Finally, this study integrates the findings and approaches to propose a Decision Support System for crack detection on road surfaces of easily acquirable front-view scene images.

Machine learning methods majorly comprise image processing and soft computing methods and are mainly responsible for automation. Wheat production is influenced by assorted varying factors. A basic requisite for best production is the seed. Sorting or grading of agricultural products influenced by computer varies product wise and even product variety wise which changes region wise. Grading for new varieties released by the agricultural scientist is the major concerned as new varieties are produced by crossing existing varieties and for these proven optimized machine learning algorithms may give an adverse result.

Recent years have witnessed enormous progress in AI-related fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing field, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several survey papers on particular sub-problems have appeared, no comprehensive survey on problems, datasets, and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles has been published. This monograph attempts to narrow this gap by providing a survey on the state-of-the-art datasets and techniques. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state of the art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding, and end-to-end learning for autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we analyze the performance of the state of the art on several challenging benchmarking datasets, including KITTI, MOT, and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we also provide a website that allows navigating topics as well as methods and provides additional information.

This book describes active illumination techniques in computer vision. We can classify computer vision techniques into two classes: passive and active techniques. Passive techniques observe the scene statically and analyse it as is. Active techniques give the scene some actions and try to facilitate the analysis. In particular, active illumination techniques project specific light, for which the characteristics are known beforehand, to a target scene to enable stable and accurate analysis of the scene. Traditional passive techniques have a fundamental limitation. The external world surrounding us is three-dimensional; the image projected on a retina or an imaging device is two-dimensional. That is, reduction of one dimension has occurred. Active illumination techniques compensate for the dimensional reduction by actively controlling the illumination. The demand for reliable vision sensors is rapidly increasing in many application areas, such as robotics and medical image analysis. This book explains this new endeavour to explore the augmentation of reduced dimensions in computer vision. This book consists of three parts: basic concepts, techniques, and applications. The first part explains the basic concepts for understanding active illumination techniques. In particular, the basic concepts of optics are explained so that researchers and engineers outside the field can understand the later chapters. The second part explains currently available active illumination techniques, covering many techniques developed by the authors. The final part shows how such active illumination techniques can be applied to various domains, describing the issue to be overcome by active illumination techniques and the advantages of using these techniques.　This book is primarily aimed at 4th year undergraduate and 1st year graduate students, and will also help engineers from fields beyond computer vision to use active illumination techniques. Additionally, the book is suitable as course material for technical seminars.

This unique text/reference presents a fresh look at nonlinear processing through nonlinear eigenvalue analysis, highlighting how one-homogeneous convex functionals can induce nonlinear operators that can be analyzed within an eigenvalue framework. The text opens with an introduction to the mathematical background, together with a summary of classical variational algorithms for vision. This is followed by a focus on the foundations and applications of the new multi-scale representation based on non-linear eigenproblems. The book then concludes with a discussion of new numerical techniques for finding nonlinear eigenfunctions, and promising research directions beyond the convex case.Topics and features: introduces the classical Fourier transform and its associated operator and energy, and asks how these concepts can be generalized in the nonlinear case; reviews the basic mathematical notion, briefly outlining the use of variational and flow-based methods to solve image-processing and computer vision algorithms; describes the properties of the total variation (TV) functional, and how the concept of nonlinear eigenfunctions relate to convex functionals; provides a spectral framework for one-homogeneous functionals, and applies this framework for denoising, texture processing and image fusion; proposes novel ways to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem using special flows that converge to eigenfunctions; examines graph-based and nonlocal methods, for which a TV eigenvalue analysis gives rise to strong segmentation, clustering and classification algorithms; presents an approach to generalizing the nonlinear spectral concept beyond the convex case, based on pixel decay analysis; discusses relations to other branches of image processing, such as wavelets and dictionary based methods.This original work offers fascinating new insights into established signal processing techniques, integrating deep mathematical concepts from a range of different fields, which will be of great interest to all researchers involved with image processing and computer vision applications, as well as computations for more general scientific problems.

This book opens with an introduction to the main purpose and tasks of the GIANA challenge, as well as a summary and an analysis of the results and performance obtained by the 20 participating teams. The early and accurate diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases is critical for increasing the chances of patient survival, and efficient screening is vital for locating precursor lesions. Video colonoscopy and wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) are the gold-standard tools for colon and intestinal tract screening, respectively. Yet these tools still present some drawbacks, such as lesion miss rate, lack of in vivo diagnosis capabilities, and perforation risk. To mitigate these, computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems can play a key role in assisting clinicians in the different stages of the exploration.This book presents the latest, state-of-the-art approaches in this field, and also tackles the clinical considerations required to efficiently deploy these systems in the exploration room. The coverage draws upon results from the Gastrointestinal Image Analysis (GIANA) Challenge, part of the EndoVis satellite events of the conferences MICCAI 2017 and 2018. Each method proposed to address the different subtasks of the challenges is detailed in a separate chapter, offering a deep insight into this topic of interest for public health.This book appeals to researchers, practitioners, and lecturers spanning both the computer vision and gastroenterology communities.

Choosing the right course, in the formative years of study is a very important decision as the future depends on this. Students are not yet mature enough to take the right decision at this stage. Selecting the wrong course means mismatch between student aptitude, capability and personal interest. Faculty or parents are mostly inexperienced. There being no other reliable source available for the most suitable direction, the recommender system has been evolved to provide him guidance in selecting the right course. A recommender system is a computer program prepared with the help of experts where the details of the background of the students and their aptitude help finding a course for his future study. Feasible predictions for student's course selection based on their marks and choice of job interest are developed logically and the problems of students are addressed via the neural network architecture based admission system helping in reducing all the problems and undesirable features ingrained in the current system and offers a well-polished, transparent and cost-effective way of selection of courses.

This research proposes to investigate the impact of a patient-centred culturally-aware design approach on the patient acceptance of e-Health web-based services, in particular, how e-Health web-based applications can be designed in a way that maximises their usability and 'fits' them into the cultural fabrics of individuals in different cultural contexts. To address this challenge, this research work examined existing literature in the fields of culture, technology acceptance and HCI, and identified relevant constructs that were used to develop a culturally-aware technology acceptance model for electronic health. Subsequently, the model provided a means for understanding the influence of different factors affecting patient acceptance and usage which were used as a foundation to inform the design of the Patient-Centred Culturally-aware e-Health Design Approach (PCCeDA) framework. The novelty in PCCeDA is the notion of cultural awareness, which allows systems to personalise themselves according to a patient's cultural profile while adhering to usability principles.

DescriptionInside, you will find an introduction to JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. These are computer programming languages. Some of them are more precisely referred to as scripting languages.Starting with JavaScript, I will introduce you to the above-mentioned programming languages. Hopefully, by the end of this book, you will have the answers to the questions of what it is and what you can do with it.JavaScript is a programming language that allows for the implementation of complex items on static web pages. Every time you look at a web page that does something besides display static information, it is a pretty safe assumption to make that JavaScript is involved. It is often referred to as the third layer of the cake.HTML is a relatively simple programming language that, at its core, consists of elements. These elements allow you to distinguish different sections of text as different aspects on your page. Whether it be a paragraph, a heading, a column, or whatever you need it to be--this is accomplished with the use of these elements.This language is also where you get the ability to create hyperlinks. The use of hyperlinks is very important, especially when you want to be able to direct someone to a specific part of your text or page. CSS is a programming language that is used to style and structure the layout of a web page. If you want to change your font, color, and background, you may do so by adding an animation or design a specific outline. This is the language you're going to make use of to accomplish those things.CSS makes use of the box model--most elements are represented as a box with the content, padding, and borders built-up like layers on an onion. You need to understand the box model before you can begin to understand how to create CSS layouts.Meanwhile, SQL is a programming language that is designed to work with sets of facts and how they relate to each other. As you might expect, relational database programs make use of SQL. Like many other computer languages, SQL is, in fact, an international standard. However, SQL is easily read and understood even by beginners.Data sets are described in SQL using SELECT statements. An SQL statement is like a sentence and consists of clauses. Some clauses are required in a SELECT statement.

Computer Graphics from Scratch demystifies the algorithms used in modern graphics software and guides beginners through building photorealistic 3D renders. Computer graphics programming books are often math-heavy and intimidating for newcomers. Not this one. Computer Graphics from Scratch takes a simpler approach by keeping the math to a minimum and focusing on only one aspect of computer graphics, 3D rendering. You'll build two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer, which simulates rays of light as they bounce off objects, and a rasterizer, which converts 3D models into 2D pixels. As you progress you'll learn how to create realistic reflections and shadows, and how to render a scene from any point of view. Pseudocode examples throughout make it easy to write your renderers in any language, and links to live JavaScript demos of each algorithm invite you to explore further on your own.Learn how to:  - Use perspective projection to draw 3D objects on a 2D plane - Simulate the way rays of light interact with surfaces - Add mirror-like reflections and cast shadows to objects - Render a scene from any camera position using clipping planes - Use flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading to mimic real surface lighting - Paint texture details onto basic shapes to create realistic-looking objects Whether you're an aspiring graphics engineer or a novice programmer curious about how graphics algorithms work, Gabriel Gambetta's simple, clear explanations will quickly put computer graphics concepts and rendering techniques within your reach. All you need is basic coding knowledge and high school math. Computer Graphics from Scratch will cover the rest.

Computer architectures describe how a computer's hardware components are connected, as well as the data transmission and processing methods used. Different computer architecture configurations have been designed to improve data processing by speeding up data movement. The CPU is at the middle of the basic architecture, with main memory and an input/output system on each side The central input/output controller is a second device configuration . The main memory is the place in the computer system from which all data and instructions flow in and out in a third computer architecture. A fourth computer architecture connects all devices in a computer system with a common data and control bus . The dual bus architecture is an improvement over the single shared central bus architecture. To improve overall performance, this architecture either separates data and control over the two buses or shares them.

Computing and communication systems are becoming increasingly interdependent is evident in almost every aspect of society. Applications of these integrated systems are also spreading. As this trend continues, it will force the computing community not only to develop revolutionary systems but also to redefine computer systems and the role of traditional research disciplines, such as operating systems, architectures, compilers, languages, and networking. Systems research faces an unprecedented challenge. Systems developers are facing a major discontinuity in the scale and nature of both applications and execution environments. Applications are changing from transforming data to directly interacting with humans; they will use hardware and data that span a wide area, even a global, network of resources, and involve interactions among users as well. Even the architecture of individual processors is uncertain. The authors look at three challenges facing systems research, describe developing solutions, and review remaining obstacles.

The twenty-first century has seen a breathtaking expansion of statistical methodology, both in scope and influence. 'Data science' and 'machine learning' have become familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? How does it all fit together? Now in paperback and fortified with exercises, this book delivers a concentrated course in modern statistical thinking. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. Each chapter ends with class-tested exercises, and the book concludes with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.

 Description This book Computer Programming Python Machine learning Swift Golang 2021 2022Is a wonderful assortment of the absolute best languages to know for the future.It is the most optimum choice of programming languages to choose for a single book. It includes the main essential languages like Python and JavaScript, that every programmer should walk into an interview knowing. But it also includes some little know new languages that you may not have heard of, that are so easy to learn and versatile and cross plat formed that they are set to explode in popularity in the near future. More about this later. If you read this book and learn these languages then your future will be lived on your own terms. Consider going into a job interview respectfully but with zero worry. Where the potential employer is the one that's being interviewed. And he seems a little desperate and a little too accommodating, that you know this is going to be another one of those interviews where he either stands up after 20 minutes offers to shake your hand and offers you the job right there on the spot.Or the interview turns into an HR interview where your assumed to be hired based on your application and you are just going through the paperwork and company benefits and policies.Either way based on what you want to do you can take the job or not take that job, because you have a choice.Opposed to the alternative of being told that you will get a call in a few weeks or don't call us we'll call you. About these languages .Python: some of the companies that use Python are, Google, Facebook, Instagram, NASA uses python, Mozilla, Firefox, Drop box, IBM, Redit, and QuaraPython is becoming one of the worlds most popular programming languages. Java Script users include Paypal, Netflix, Uber, Group on, Facebook, Google, E-bay, Airbnb, Stack, Slack and, Instagram. Machine Learning (AI) What is it? And what is it used for? It can be used along with python, since it is used in Google search, and auto complete. It helps predict what you will search for next. Machine Learning (AI) Is used in many different fields and applications including, self driving/parking cars, facial recognition, medical x-ray image interpretation, drones and many many other applications.. Swift is also a great language to learn, because everything has to move with fund transfers. APP creation Android, and IOS is used by swift. This is also a cross plat form language.  GO Golang, ( go language) Last but defiantly not least GO is my second favorite language next to Python or JavaScript. This new programming language is not very well Know but it is designed to be super easy to learn and has many of the best features from many top languages. It is also a very user friendly cross platform language, among the many new streamlined features it has a built in garbage collector.

The ""Miss Manners Goes Geek"" beginner's manual for Windows specifically created for conceptual learners. Because computer use is no longer optional in the modern world, this do-it-yourself manual was designed especially for those final remaining hold-outs who hate technology in general, and computers in particular. It takes the literary/artistic type through every single step required to obtain a basic-to-intermediate understanding of computers, with the emphasis on ""understanding."" And while the introduction is aimed at an older, and distinctly hostile and essentially captive audience of technology-averse first-time users, the lessons themselves would be suitable for anyone who wishes to advance with computers by gaining a conceptual understanding of how they work. The manual is divided into 10 short lessons which presuppose absolutely no knowledge of computers. It is written in clear, conversational prose, and explains computers in the same manner that non-technical subjects are taught. When completed, the student will have acquired the ability to purchase a computer and internet service; set up a new computer; create and read a personalized daily newsfeed; shop and bank online; apply for online accounts, download and install apps; use the media player and transfer CDs to a computer and MP3 player; create and organize files and folders; use the internet to view art and access free, archival material; create and use internet email and Facebook, apply for personal and conference video accounts; edit digital images, and use a digital camera. It contains an 18-page glossary of terms for reference, and explains each term and technique in painstaking, standard-usage English instead of abbreviated, incomprehensible techno-speak. Special note about the black and white edition: Although it does contain the same the pictures as the color version, this budget, black and white edition is not intended to function as a ""picture book."" The poor quality of the images relegates them to the status of supplements only, and although they might enhance the written explanations, they are not reliable sources of independent information for first-time computer users.

This book depicts a prototype application that assists persons with severe motor disabilities communicate using only their eyes. It also represents a proof for a cheaper solution than the commercial assistants. By using smartphones, a user's eye movement can be used for manipulating a keyboard for writing messages. However, robust eye tracking algorithms and intuitive user interfaces are a challenge considering smartphone's processing power and small screen. A prototype application was built for Android smartphones. From the several eye tracking algorithms and user interfaces implemented, only the one that seemed best was user tested. The user evaluation was conducted through the online medium and also with supervised users. The results of the user evaluation shows that the prototype application is difficult to use for uninstructed users. The user experience questionnaire shows that all test users were excited about the prototype. Moreover, they believe the prototype could become a product with certain improvements. As a conclusion the prototype demonstrates that cheap solutions can be implemented for communication using only eye movement.

Understand essential computer science concepts and skills. This book focuses on the foundational and fundamental concepts upon which expertise in specific areas can be developed, including computer architecture, programming language, algorithm and data structure, operating systems, computer networks, distributed systems, security, and more.According to code.org, there are 500,000 open programming positions available in the US-- compared to an annual crop of just 50,000 graduating computer science majors. The US Department of Labor predicted that there will be almost a million and a half computer science jobs in the very near future, but only enough programmers to fill roughly one third of these jobs. To bridge the gap, many people not formally trained in computer science are employed in programming jobs. Although they are able to start programming and coding quickly, it often takes them time to acquire the necessary understanding to gain the requisite skills to become an efficient computer engineer or advanced developer.  What You Will Learn The fundamentals of how a computer worksThe basics of computer programming and programming paradigmsHow to write efficient programsHow the hardware and software work together to provide a good user experience and enhance the usability of the systemHow computers can talk to each otherHow to ensure the security of the systemThe fundamentals of cloud offerings, implications/trade-offs, and deployment/adoption configurationsThe fundamentals of machine learningWho This Book Is For Computer programmers lacking a formal education in computer science, and anyone with a formal education in computer science, looking to develop a general understanding of computer science fundamentals

In my last book, Geometry for Computer Graphics, I employed a mixture of algebra and vector analysis to prove many of the equations used in computer graphics. At the time, I did not make any distinction between the two methodologies, but slowly it dawned upon me that I had had to discover, for the first time, how to use vector analysis and associated strategies for solving geometric problems. I suppose that mathematicians are taught this as part of their formal mathematical training, but then, I am not a mathematician! After some deliberation, I decided to write a book that would introduce the beginner to the world of vectors and their application to the geometric problems encountered in computer graphics. I accepted the fact that there would be some duplication of formulas between this and my last book; however, this time I would concentrate on explaining how problems are solved. The book contains eleven chapters: The first chapter distinguishes between scalar and vector quantities, which is reasonably straightforward. The second chapter introduces vector repres- tation, starting with Cartesian coordinates and concluding with the role of direction cosines in changes in axial systems. The third chapter explores how the line equation has a natural vector interpretation and how vector analysis is used to resolve a variety of line-related, geometric problems. Chapter 4 repeats Chapter 3 in the context of the plane.

Technology scholars declare an emergency: attention must be paid to the inequality, marginalization, and biases woven into our technological systems. This book sounds an alarm: we can no longer afford to be lulled into complacency by narratives of techno-utopianism, or even techno-neutrality. We should not be reassured by such soothing generalities as ""human error,"" ""virtual reality,"" or ""the cloud."" We need to realize that nothing is virtual: everything that ""happens online,"" ""virtually,"" or ""autonomously"" happens offline first, and often involves human beings whose labor is deliberately kept invisible. Everything is IRL. In Your Computer Is on Fire, technology scholars train a spotlight on the inequality, marginalization, and biases woven into our technological systems.

Before the advent off the wireless technology era, the existing communication technologies were primarily powered by wired technology. From the telephone to the fax machine, communication was not possible without a physical connection between the communication device and the source of the power of the device. For instance, there had to be a connection between a wired telephone and the dial board for communication to be possible. Just as with every other wired device, wireless communication has successfully displaced wired communication. The term wireless communication came into existence in the 19th century. Over the years, wireless communication technology has taken a new dimension. It ranks among the best mediums of information transmission from one device to other devices. This is not unconnected to the ease with which it allows users to communicate with others even if they are operating from a remote area. There are tons of devices that have been adapted for wireless communications. They include GPS, cordless phones, satellite television, Wi-Fi,  and some other wireless computer parts. Recently, both the 3 and 4G networks have been included in the list alongside Bluetooth. This guide will cover the following topics: Wireless hardware and standardSubnetting Reminders and TipsWireless TechnologiesManaging Routers and SwitchesAdvanced ConfigurationsIPv6 vs IPv4The Internet's big arenaMoving the RouterCabling the NetworkSubnetting BasicsIPv6 SubnettingScaling Networks...

Artificial intelligence has already enabled pivotal advances in diverse fields, yet its impact on computer architecture has only just begun. In particular, recent work has explored broader application to the design, optimization, and simulation of computer architecture. Notably, machine-learning-based strategies often surpass prior state-of-the-art analytical, heuristic, and human-expert approaches. This book reviews the application of machine learning in system-wide simulation and run-time optimization, and in many individual components such as caches/memories, branch predictors, networks-on-chip, and GPUs. The book further analyzes current practice to highlight useful design strategies and identify areas for future work, based on optimized implementation strategies, opportune extensions to existing work, and ambitious long term possibilities. Taken together, these strategies and techniques present a promising future for increasingly automated computer architecture designs.

""Havill's problem-driven approach introduces algorithmic concepts in context and motivates students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds."" -- Janet Davis, Associate Professor and Microsoft Chair of Computer Science, Whitman College　 ""This book looks really great and takes exactly the approach I think should be used for a CS 1 course. I think it really fills a need in the textbook landscape."" --　Marie desJardins, Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences, Simmons University ""Discovering Computer Science is a refreshing departure from introductory programming texts, offering students a much more sincere introduction to the breadth and complexity of this ever-growing field."" --　James　Deverick, Senior Lecturer, The College of William and Mary ""This unique introduction to the science of computing guides students through broad and universal approaches to problem solving in a variety of contexts and their ultimate implementation as computer programs."" --　Daniel Kaplan, DeWitt Wallace Professor, Macalester College Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming　is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience. Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students' prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities.　 The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component.　 Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features. The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses. This book contains 30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading.　 The accompanying website -- https: //www.discoveringcs.net -- includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.

This book presents the ""New Vision 2050,"" which adds the concept of the ""platinum society"" to the ""Vision 2050"".The 20th century was a century in which energy led the development of material civilization, resulting in deletion of resources, global warming and climate change. What form should sustainable material and energy take to protect the Earth? The ""Vision 2050"" was established 20 years ago as a model that we should pursue for the next half century. Fortunately, the world is on course for the Vision 2050.The 21st century will be a century in which we seek qualitative richness, with the Vision 2050 as the material basis. That is, a ""platinum society"" that has resource self-sufficiency and resource symbiosis, and where people remain active throughout their lives and have a wide range of choices and opportunities for free participation. Since the author presented the concept of ""Vision 2050"" in 1999, the idea has been introduced in two books entitled Vision 2050: Roadmap for a Sustainable Earth (2008) and Beyond the Limits to Growth: New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan (2014). The latter includes a chapter that sheds light on the concept of a ""platinum society"". In this publication, the author presents the ""New Vision 2050"" in more detail.

Safety, from the Latin sine cura (""without concern""), is the condition that makes and makes one feel free from danger, or that gives the possibility to prevent, eliminate or make less serious damage, risks, difficulties, unpleasant events and the like.Companies, most of the time, underestimate the security aspect, when it would be enough just a little common sense to devote a small amount of time to staff training to make everyone understand the main issues that concern them; it is necessary to create security policies that are not too complicated for users and to accustom the ""distracted"" user to have more attention in daily activities. Working in the world of Information Security requires constant updating and daily study. The available technologies are increasing and becoming more and more complex and for this reason the need to secure data and information also increases.Nowadays you do not realize how easily data is accessible on the network and how easy it is to find important information simply by browsing.Hackers' objectives range from searching for system vulnerabilities to finding a person's vulnerability. It is important that everyone is informed about the concept of security in order to be more aware of the risks they are facing.""There is no system that guarantees a maximum level of security.""

The Colorado River Basin's importance cannot be overstated. Its living river system supplies water to roughly forty million people in the United States, contains Grand Canyon National Park, Bears Ears National Monument, and wide swaths of other public lands, and encompasses the ancestral homes of twenty-nine Native American tribes. John Wesley Powell, a one-armed Civil War veteran, explorer, scientist, and adept federal administrator, articulated a vision for Euro-American colonization of the ""Arid Lands"" that has indelibly shaped the basin--a pattern that looms large not only in western history, but also in contemporary environmental and social policy.  One hundred and fifty years after Powell's epic 1869 Colorado River Exploring Expedition, this volume revisits Powell's vision, considering both its historical character and its relative influence on the Colorado River Basin's cultural and physical landscape in modern times. In three parts, the volume unpacks Powell's ideas on water, public lands, and Native Americans--ideas at once innovative, complex, and contradictory. With an eye toward climate change and a host of related challenges currently facing the basin, the volume turns to the future, reflecting on how--if at all--Powell's legacy can inform our collective vision as we navigate a new ""Great Unknown.""

In the last decades, various mathematical problems have been solved by computer-assisted proofs, among them the Kepler conjecture, the existence of chaos, the existence of the Lorenz attractor, the famous four-color problem, and more. In many cases, computer-assisted proofs have the remarkable advantage (compared with a ""theoretical"" proof) of additionally providing accurate quantitative information. The authors have been working more than a quarter century to establish methods for the verified computation of solutions for partial differential equations, mainly for nonlinear elliptic problems of the form -∆u=f(x, u,∇u) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here, by ""verified computation"" is meant a computer-assisted numerical approach for proving the existence of a solution in a close and explicit neighborhood of an approximate solution. The quantitative information provided by these techniques is also significant from the viewpoint of a posteriori error estimates for approximate solutions of the concerned partial differential equations in a mathematically rigorous sense. In this monograph, the authors give a detailed description of the verified computations and computer-assisted proofs for partial differential equations that they developed. In Part I, the methods mainly studied by the authors Nakao and Watanabe are presented. These methods are based on a finite dimensional projection and constructive a priori error estimates for finite element approximations of the Poisson equation. In Part II, the computer-assisted approaches via eigenvalue bounds developed by the author Plum are explained in detail. The main task of this method consists of establishing eigenvalue bounds for the linearization of the corresponding nonlinear problem at the computed approximate solution. Some brief remarks on other approaches are also given in Part III. Each method in Parts I and II is accompanied by appropriate numerical examples that confirm the actual usefulness of the authors' methods. Also in some examples practical computer algorithms are supplied so that readers can easily implement the verification programs by themselves.

Revision with unchanged content. Computer simulations are increasingly recognized as educational tools that facilitate students' learning in a safe environment. However, the way in which the simulations are used can have considerable impact on learning outcomes. Some have argued that exploratory learning is an effective strategy for lear-ning new materials; but others have expressed concern that allowing free ex-ploration may result in less efficient, or even inaccurate, learning and there-fore encourage more guided exploration. The purpose of this work is to com-pare learning outcomes of students using an interactive computer simulation designed to teach fundamentals of oxygenation management under two ex-ploratory learning methods (free versus guided exploration). This book is ad-dressed to health professionals such as nurses and doctors who are planning to use computer simulation in clinical as well as educators using interactive simulations as part of their educational process.

Revision with unchanged content. Combustion synthesis (CS) has been a popular research topic in the last 3 decades. Motivation was due to attractive properties and possibilities, compared to conventional materials processing and synthesis techniques. Although, it is a fairly simple process, CS involves quite complex mechanisms that occur simultaneously at rapidly changing high temperatures in the short duration (few sec.) of the reaction. Gravity plays an important role in CS; therefore a deeper comprehension of the effects of gravity on non-equilibrium mechanisms is needed. Similarly, electric current activation presents several advantages, by overcoming kinetic and thermodynamic limitations as well as providing control over the properties of the reaction and final product. Present investigation utilized a chemical oven technique, where the sample is embedded in a mixture of exothermic powder mixture. It focused on answering essential questions by separating different mechanisms and understanding fundamental aspects of gravity and electric current in CS. Phenomena investigated included reactive settling, dissolution and precipitation, and reactive liquid metal flow. CS is considered as a potential technique with various advantages and applications in NASA's new vision for space exploration: Moon, Mars, and beyond!

Revision with unchanged content. This book aims to describe work carried out within the project Brain- Computer Interface (BCI). Control over a computer application will be represented with Brain-Gaming, i.e. computer games like Ping-Pong, Pacman or Tetris. For this purpose, several control strategies were developed, implemented and proved experimentally in different scenarios. The most important aspect of the design and development of these interfaces turned out to be their flexibility. Control over a device could include the steering and moving of a wheel-chair for paralyzed patients or the gaining of control over an arm or foot prosthesis for patients with amputated limbs. Latter was realized here as a computer-based simulation of a virtual arm, such that it can be tested in future experiments on patients with amputated limbs. In contrast to the Brain-Gaming experiments, where the player was equipped with an additional communication channel, the experiments with patients did not require an ultra-fast recognition of the intended movement; i.e. the command signal for a simulated movement can be recognized after the phantom movement is initialized and performed.

This book describes automotive vision camera systems to provide road scene information necessary for autonomous driving vehicles to plan driving routes and establish driving rules. For this purpose, a lane detection system and a traffic sign recognition (TSR) system, which can be implemented by an image sensor alone, were designed based on a neuromorphic processor and evaluated through the experiments. The vision camera system for autonomous driving vehicles must ensure the stability of the system for the safety of the driver and also the flexibility of the system for high recognition accuracy. In this book, in order to achieve the stability and flexibility of the automotive system, the neuromorphic network input was diversified into pixel values or statistical pattern vectors of the original image according to the pattern characteristics of the lanes and the traffic signs.

The term of Graphics comes from Greek ""graphikos"" which means 'something written' e.g. autograph. So, Graphics are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone to inform, illustrate, or entertain. The term computer graphics includes almost everything on computers that is not text or sound. Computer graphics can be a series of images which most often called video or a single image. The definition of computer graphics is the technology that deals with designs and pictures on computers. So, computer graphics are visual representations of data displayed on a monitor made on a computer.

Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students' prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities. The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component. Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features.  The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses.  30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading.  The accompanying website -- http: //DiscoverCS.denison.edu -- includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.

This book relates work on conception and evaluation of interactive systems based on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). This type of interfaces was first developed in order to provide disabled people with means of interaction and communication, and more recently in other fields such as video games. However, most research on the subject focused on identification of promising brain signals to carry information, and on the signal processing methods to this information. By comparison, little has been done on usability and human factors in the interactive system as whole. This PhD focuses on SSVEP-based systems (steady-state visually evoked potentials), and aims at studying the whole brain-computer interactive system, following the methods and criteria of Human-Computer Interaction(IHM). More precisely, the main themes of this work are cognitive demand, user frustration, calibration conditions, and Hybrid BCIs.

The data representation of such descriptive metadata is a challenging task since digital media can be stored in various forms each of which provides, if at all, its own specific method for integrating its assigned metadata. The author analyzes existing techniques and intro-duces new approaches to store a digital medium, for example a digital image, and additional information associated with that medium, for example texts, other images, or auditory data. Illustration Watermarking as a subclass of information hiding emerged as an applicable technique in this regard. Besides the internal representation of descriptive metadata, its visual representation is another aspect addressed in this work. Taking into consideration that display space is limited, techniques for guiding the viewer to those regions associated with the metadata sought and techniques for presenting the metadata are introduced. Many interesting application scenarios illustrate what is envisioned by the author.

Revision with unchanged content. Modern microprocessors make use of speculation, or predictions about future program behavior, to optimize the execution of programs. Perceptrons are simple neural networks that can be highly useful in speculation for their ability to examine larger quantities of available data than more commonly used approaches, and identify which data lead to accurate results. This work first studies how perceptrons can be made to predict accurately when they directly replace the traditional pattern table predictor. Different training me-thods, perceptron topologies, and interference reduction strategies are evaluated. Perceptrons are then applied to two speculative applications: data value prediction and dataflow critical path prediction. Several novel perce-ptron-based prediction strategies are proposed for each application that can take advantage of a wider scope of past data in making predictions than previous predictors could. These predictors are evaluated against local table-based approaches on a custom cycle-accurate processor simulator, and are shown on average to have both superior accuracy and higher instruction-per-cycle performance. This work is addressed to computer architects and com-puter engineering researchers.

The potential benefits of ICT have been identified by many countries in the world. Therefore, the essential requirement for schools and educational institutions have been made to expand teaching and learning environments and increasing the demand for education and training in most of the countries in the world. Geometry is a very significant study in the field of mathematics. It is a subset of the mathematics subject which associates with culture, history, art and design. Furthermore, geometry is commonly used to model the real-world concept which has many applications in solving practical problems. The methodical group geometrical knowledge of the ancient Greeks is one of the major successes of classical geometry. Learning geometry makes the secondary students develop some basic skills which include logical thinking abilities; spatial intuition about the universe; comparing and generalising; being careful and patient; as well as the reading and comprehension of geometrical concepts. The dynamic geometry computer software allows the users to construct geometry figures or shapes and to measure the variables of the shapes and determine the properties of them. It allows the users to; drag the figures through the screen, make geometric constructions and explain the facts about these constructions as well as test them so that the user will generalise the facts. The interactive learning environments of dynamic geometry computer software support the teaching and learning of abstract geometrical concepts in mathematics. The dynamic geometry computer software influenced students in gaining student-centered education and self-regulation. The integration of dynamic geometry computer software in learning geometry will enhance the construction knowledge in addition to the communication and dissemination of ideas in the geometry classroom.

Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online. News from India 2012: the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh highlights that cyber crime is increasing day by day in India. It is crucial to note that text messages and videos which are being posted online have been abused dramatically! Consequently, many ethnic clashes in India's northeastern state of Assam between the Bodo tribals and Muslims have aroused. More than 90 lives have been taken during this ethnic war which have spurred more than 400, 000 people to seek refuge in camps. Alarmingly, the new dominance of technology has put India in anger of being infiltrated by the Pakistani agents. The Indian Prime Minister has warned that an increase in infiltration attempts by the Pakistani counterparts to cross India's international border of Kashmir, has been detected...

Thinking Like a Computer is the result of a detailed 30-year study of how computers imitate life. Although they are machines, computers are designed to act like human beings. Software is specifically created to help accomplish human-like tasks and to be understood in human terms. Yet unlike human life, computer operations can be analyzed in detail because we build the machines that accomplish them and we know the design decisions that make them work. With every choice made during the evolution of digital technology, computer architects have intuitively or consciously incorporated truths of human functioning into their designs. Thinking Like a Computer is based on these truths, assembling them into a new explanation of human knowledge. In addition, it provides insights into the foundations of theoretical science because much of digital technology is dedicated to creating new realities.

Revision with unchanged content. This book explores the reform of intellectual property regulation policies with respect to computer software within two advanced industrial nations after 1980. A comparative case analysis of the United States and Japan provides insight as to how advanced industrial nations have responded to market forces, competing private interests, and international pressure for policy harmonization in the construction and implementation of intellectual property regulation reforms. This study shows that ideological and structural arrangements of state institutions have influenced the extent of liberalization in intellectual property policy, and the preservation of equilibrium between individual rights and public interests in the establishment of intellectual property.

The population, the species and the biocenosis are presented and analysed as systemic units which really exist, work and evolve, having reciprocal relationships with the abiotic environment at the same time, only in ecosystems. No population or species exists in isolation. From the point of view of the theory of systems, the population, as a group of organisms which can be found in a biocenosis, is a common subsystem for the two systems, i.e. the biocenosis and the species. The population also has a double function: an ecological one in the biocenosis and a genetical one within the species. All the populations and the species can be considered as ecological units because their organisms have ecological adaptations, and the populations are structural parts in the biocenosis and have ecological functions in the process of production, consumption and decomposition of organic matter in the ecosystems, which is an aspect scarcely shown so far. At the level of the populations there are also genetical functions, particularly natural selection which generates new ecological adaptations (and others) as new species.

A computer network is a communication network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections between nodes. These data links are established over guided media and unguided media. Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes are generally identified by network IP addresses, and can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, and servers, as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches. Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device through wired or wireless, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the WWW, Audio and Video shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and scanners, and use of email and instant messaging applications as well as many others. Computer networks differ in the transmission medium used to carry their signals

This textbook is an ideal introduction in college courses or self-study for learning computer programming using the C language. Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author's many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.

Computer Based Test (CBT) is an effective solution for mass education assessment. However, a diversity of e-assessment methods and systems have been developed in recent times but in the developing world it is still transitional, so far lack of flexible timing functionality to automatically log-off candidates upon expiration of allotted time, result integrity compromise, stand-alone positioning, lack of flexibility, robustness and scalability as well as human error are major limitations of the existing platforms. To ensure maximum security, various security measures/ techniques are used to authenticate the user and check if the person who is logging into the system is the right person or not; various techniques are used like biometric authentication, fingerprint or face recognition via webcam.

Revision with unchanged content. Today's computer systems are running (mostly) one kind of operating system which makes it easy for a new virus to spread rapidly. The author Markus Unterleitner presents in this book the model and the implementation of the computer immune system (CIS) based on several mechanisms of the human immune system. It is shown how effective the implementation of the CIS is at detecting malicious code in packets of the network traffic. The implemented CIS is not centrally or hierarchically controlled and it is intended to shield computers in a LAN from new network driven attack attempts. The targets for this adaptive and distributed detection system are Internet worms, different kinds of viruses and shellcodes, which are possibly polymorph. Biological inspired mechanisms make it possible that the computer systems have independently evolving shields. This makes systems more diverse and they become more robust to today's common and zeroday threats. This book addresses people who are entrusted with or interested in network security. It goes also to researchers or students in the computer security field and people who are maintaining or protecting computer networks in companies.

Revision with unchanged content. Can the sequence of practice tasks affect the transfer of complex cognitive skills? Researchers have sifted through findings of instructional and cognitive science to find the most effective practice strategies by which to design practice tasks. Such strategies would enable learners to abstract principles, build schemata, and transfer their cognitive structures to improve performance of their skills in further learning or in the workplace. One such practice strategy, the random sequence of practice tasks-high contextual interference-has been applied in computer-based instruction. Although block sequence of practice-practicing parts of skill in contiguous sets-results in quicker and easier skill acquisition, random sequence of practice-mixing skill parts in practice sessions-results in superior transfer to unpracticed variants of a skill. This 'contextual interference effect' has been found quite consistently in motor skills. How can this 'transfer paradox, ' as it has been called, be most effectively applied with complex cognitive skills? Curriculum planners, instructional designers, and researchers will find design and research suggestions that might help guide their work

The main function of Drilling Engineering is to make decisions to ensure that the well is completed as safely and economically as possible. Based on this, two important methods were emphasized in this Book Project. These are (i) Penetration Rate-Cost Method and (ii) Multiple Regression Approach to calculate the optimum operating bit load and rotary speed. The application of both methods needs to solve a stack of mixed equations which were derived considering some relations and approaches. Therefore, the manual calculations are both time-consuming and risk of error. Here, an algorithm has been developed to use both methods through a computer program and the developed algorithm has been converted into the computer program running in the ""Windows Operating System"". With the use of this program, we can say that the process of making decisions that will ensure the completion of the well as safely and economically as possible will be faster and safely.

Computer vision and machine intelligence paradigms are prominent in the domain of medical image applications, including computer assisted diagnosis, image guided radiation therapy, landmark detection, imaging genomics, and brain connectomics. Medical image analysis and understanding are daunting tasks owing to the massive influx of multi-modal medical image data generated during routine clinal practice. Advanced computer vision and machine intelligence approaches have been employed in recent years in the field of image processing and computer vision. However, due to the unstructured nature of medical imaging data and the volume of data produced during routine clinical processes, the applicability of these meta-heuristic algorithms remains to be investigated. Advanced Machine Vision Paradigms for Medical Image Analysis presents an overview of how medical imaging data can be analyzed to provide better diagnosis and treatment of disease. Computer vision techniques can explore texture, shape, contour and prior knowledge along with contextual information, from image sequence and 3D/4D information which helps with better human understanding. Many powerful tools have been developed through image segmentation, machine learning, pattern classification, tracking, and reconstruction to surface much needed quantitative information not easily available through the analysis of trained human specialists. The aim of the book is for medical imaging professionals to acquire and interpret the data, and for computer vision professionals to learn how to provide enhanced medical information by using computer vision techniques. The ultimate objective is to benefit patients without adding to already high healthcare costs.

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.

We live in the world where nothing is difficult, if there is market. There is therefore the dilemma of want and need. Technology wants, what life wants. Using technologies, it seems, it is possible to do anything and produce anything. The centre of gravity of engineering profession is shifting. The world wants confident engineers who can foresee and manage the unknown and unexpected problems. Engineers are expected to understand global issues, and the nuances of working in a culturally diverse space. They are expected to appreciate, more than before, the human dimensions of emerging technologies. There are many questions, such as - Do I take pride in designing a thing and manufacturing it, as I take pride in packaging it? Are we cultivating the right kind of engineering mindset? What a general engineering toolkit must contain? Are there enough challenging jobs in the manufacturing industry to attract good engineers? Is it right to allow the creation of future elites who have augmented themselves with artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, without inventing a way to manage their superhuman abilities? Can there be better engineering than life itself? Should we be optimistic about the future of technology? Are we working harder than we are required to work? Can technology improve work-life balance? Is the society ready to accept the exponential development challenges? These, and many such issues are the concerns of science, engineering, technology and society. This book is an attempt to deliberate upon these issues for the welfare of humankind.

Computer-Controlled Systems with Delay is a systematic study of the problems of analysis and synthesis for multidimensional sampled-data (SD) systems with delay. It is based on the frequency polynomial method, in which the concept of a parametric transfer matrix (PTM) plays a key role. Until now, no alternative general methods have been available to solve the above problems. The text is divided into three parts:   background information from the theory of polynomial and rational matrices, helps the reader to acquire the basic understanding necessary to use the main content of the book without addressing additional sources; methods for the mathematical description of multidimensional SD systems with delay, based on the concept of the PTM; and optimization methods for multidimensional SD systems with delay, including H2 and L2 optimization as well as H2 optimization for colored input signals.   The monograph is completed by three appendices. An algorithm for constructing the set of pathological sampling periods for a continuous SISO object with delay is provided first. MATLAB(R)-toolbox algorithms representing methods described in the book and application examples for selected optimization problems are given in the second. A solution to the problem of guaranteeing the required performance in a class of stochastic disturbances for SD systems with delay is considered in the third. Computer-Controlled Systems with Delay is intended for engineers, scientists and teachers working in modern control theory. It will also benefit post-graduate students taking courses in related disciplines. The book continues the description of the authors' research results on developing methods for SD systems theory which are based on the PTM concept and published in the monographs Computer Controlled Systems and Multivariable Computer-controlled Systems.

Computer simulations based on mathematical models have become ubiquitous across the engineering disciplines and throughout the physical sciences. Successful use of a simulation model, however, requires careful interrogation of the model through systematic computer experiments. While specific theoretical/mathematical examinations of computer experiment design are available, those interested in applying proposed methodologies need a practical presentation and straightforward guidance on analyzing and interpreting experiment results. Written by authors with strong academic reputations and real-world practical experience, Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments is exactly the kind of treatment you need. The authors blend a sound, modern statistical approach with extensive engineering applications and clearly delineate the steps required to successfully model a problem and provide an analysis that will help find the solution. Part I introduces the design and modeling of computer experiments and the basic concepts used throughout the book. Part II focuses on the design of computer experiments. The authors present the most popular space-filling designs - like Latin hypercube sampling and its modifications and uniform design - including their definitions, properties, construction and related generating algorithms. Part III discusses the modeling of data from computer experiments. Here the authors present various modeling techniques and discuss model interpretation, including sensitivity analysis. An appendix reviews the statistics and mathematics concepts needed, and numerous examples clarify the techniques and their implementation. The complexity of real physical systems means that there is usually no simple analytic formula that sufficiently describes the phenomena. Useful both as a textbook and professional reference, this book presents the techniques you need to design and model computer experiments for practical problem solving.

This book provides a vivid account of the early history of molecular simulation, a new frontier for our understanding of matter that was opened when the demands of theoretical physicists were met by the availability of the modern computers. Since their inception, electronic computers have enormously increased their performance, thus making possible the unprecedented technological revolution that characterizes our present times. This obvious technological advancement has brought with it a silent scientific revolution in the practice of theoretical physics. In particular, in the physics of matter it has opened up a direct route from the microscopic physical laws to observable phenomena. One can now study the time evolution of systems composed of millions of molecules, and simulate the behaviour of macroscopic materials and actually predict their properties. Molecular simulation has provided a new theoretical and conceptual tool that physicists could only dream of when the foundations of statistical mechanics were laid.  Molecular simulation has undergone impressive development, both in the size of the scientific community involved and in the range and scope of its applications. It has become the ubiquitous workhorse for investigating the nature of complex condensed matter systems in physics, chemistry, materials and the life sciences. Yet these developments remain largely unknown outside the inner circles of practitioners, and they have so far never been described for a wider public. The main objective of this book is therefore to offer a reasonably comprehensive reconstruction of the early history of molecular simulation addressed to an audience of both scientists and interested non-scientists, describing the scientific and personal trajectories of the main protagonists and discussing the deep conceptual innovations that their work produced.

This is the first book on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that aims to explain how these BCI interfaces can be used for artistic goals. Devices that measure changes in brain activity in various regions of our brain are available and they make it possible to investigate how brain activity is related to experiencing and creating art. Brain activity can also be monitored in order to find out about the affective state of a performer or bystander and use this knowledge to create or adapt an interactive multi-sensorial (audio, visual, tactile) piece of art. Making use of the measured affective state is just one of the possible ways to use BCI for artistic expression.  We can also stimulate brain activity. It can be evoked externally by exposing our brain to external events, whether they are visual, auditory, or tactile. Knowing about the stimuli and the effect on the brain makes it possible to translate such external stimuli to decisions and commands that help to design, implement, or adapt an artistic performance, or interactive installation. Stimulating brain activity can also be done internally. Brain activity can be voluntarily manipulated and changes can be translated into computer commands to realize an artistic vision.  The chapters in this book have been written by researchers in human-computer interaction, brain-computer interaction, neuroscience, psychology and social sciences, often in cooperation with artists using BCI in their work. It is the perfect book for those seeking to learn about brain-computer interfaces used for artistic applications.

Computer Intelligence (CI) is the combination of computer power and the increasingly sophisticated software which that power makes possible. CI has an ever-increasing impact on human society, the economy, and how we fight wars. Artificial Intelligence is a recent innovation with both an impressive impact and concerns over its dangers, but it is simply a tipping point in the evolution of CI. AI techniques are practical because CI passed a threshold of performance that made its methods computationally feasible. Such breakthroughs have occurred in the past, and will continue at an accelerating pace. CI's growth will continue to impact society, change the nature of our economy, and change warfare, with cyberwarfare the critical battleground.Computer technology is embedded in modern life to an extent that was unimaginable a half-century ago. Where it will be fifty years from now is similarly difficult to predict.Today's society depends on CI. Infrastructure such as the electric grids that power our homes and businesses are controlled automatically by computers and digital technology. Human communications are driven by digital networks, including the increasingly important role of mobile phones. Our dependence on computer technology is unfortunately too often made evident today when malicious cyberattacks impact business operations, our security, and even politics.Computer intelligence has long augmented human intelligence, providing tools that let us do things well beyond our native human abilities. Computers have long done arithmetic faster and more accurately than any human and have bigger and more reliable memories. We expand our intelligence with the aid of such common software as spreadsheet programs and spelling checkers in word processing programs. Computers have always been tools that expanded human abilities, and they are continuing to do so.A core reason for the growing power of computer technology is faster computer processing and more memory. Today, that fundamental trend is being accelerated by options such as cloud computing and specialized chips.CI also requires invention in the methodology that the software executes. AI techniques such as machine learning using deep neural networks are an advance in such methodology. Such improvements add power to CI by adding to the things it can do, not just how fast it can do them. The utility of these methods, however, can depend on CI being powerful enough to make them practical.This growing power can also create problems. The increase in propaganda and misinformation on the Web and in social media and the danger of hacking and cyberattacks are but two of many issues.This book discusses the history, current state, and future of Computer Intelligence. With its growing impact on our lives and society, it behooves us to understand computer intelligence more deeply, both to take full advantage of the technology and to avoid potential dangers. Exploration of how Computer Intelligence advanced to where it is today and how it is likely to evolve helps in understanding a difficult topic. This book makes computer technology less mysterious and less obscure. CI will impact us at an increasing rate, and understanding it will help us control its evolution. Meisel explores if Computer Intelligence is indeed With Us or Against Us.

The use of computer will be different if we design the computer screen with coordinate axes and taking alphabets as the points of language. Only use of alphabets can make language plane which is useful to us differently because every letter, word, sentence has a distinct image on language plane as well as computer screen . By drawing various design we get a directed image . All the directed image has a particular one to one relation with a letter or word or sentence of our language plane. If we create the computer screen then also the computer page or computer language plane can help us differently to do our work .

Human communications are driven by digital networks, including the increasingly important role of mobile phones. Our dependence on computer technology is unfortunately too often made evident today when malicious cyberattacks impact business operations, our security, and even politics.Computer intelligence has long augmented human intelligence, providing tools that let us do things well beyond our native human abilities. Computers have long done arithmetic faster and more accurately than any human and have bigger and more reliable memories. We expand our intelligence with the aid of such common software as spreadsheet programs and spelling checkers in word processing programs. Computers have always been tools that expanded human abilities, and they are continuing to do so.A core reason for the growing power of computer technology is faster computer processing and more memory. Today, that fundamental trend is being accelerated by options such as cloud computing and specialized chips.CI also requires invention in the methodology that the software executes. AI techniques such as machine learning using deep neural networks are an advance in such methodology. Such improvements add power to CI by adding to the things it can do, not just how fast it can do them. The utility of these methods, however, can depend on CI being powerful enough to make them practical.This growing power can also create problems. The increase in propaganda and misinformation on the Web and in social media and the danger of hacking and cyberattacks are but two of many issues.This book discusses the history, current state, and future of Computer Intelligence. With its growing impact on our lives and society, it behooves us to understand computer intelligence more deeply, both to take full advantage of the technology and to avoid potential dangers. Exploration of how Computer Intelligence advanced to where it is today and how it is likely to evolve helps in understanding a difficult topic. This book makes computer technology less mysterious and less obscure. CI will impact us at an increasing rate, and understanding it will help us control its evolution. Meisel explores if Computer Intelligence is indeed With Us or Against Us.

In the last decades, various mathematical problems have been solved by computer-assisted proofs, among them the Kepler conjecture, the existence of chaos, the existence of the Lorenz attractor, the famous four-color problem, and more. In many cases, computer-assisted proofs have the remarkable advantage (compared with a ""theoretical"" proof) of additionally providing accurate quantitative information. The authors have been working more than a quarter century to establish methods for the verified computation of solutions for partial differential equations, mainly for nonlinear elliptic problems of the form -∆u=f(x, u,∇u) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here, by ""verified computation"" is meant a computer-assisted numerical approach for proving the existence of a solution in a close and explicit neighborhood of an approximate solution. The quantitative information provided by these techniques is also significant from the viewpoint of a posteriori error estimates for approximate solutions of the concerned partial differential equations in a mathematically rigorous sense. In this monograph, the authors give a detailed description of the verified computations and computer-assisted proofs for partial differential equations that they developed. In Part I, the methods mainly studied by the authors Nakao and Watanabe are presented. These methods are based on a finite dimensional projection and constructive a priori error estimates for finite element approximations of the Poisson equation. In Part II, the computer-assisted approaches via eigenvalue bounds developed by the author Plum are explained in detail. The main task of this method consists of establishing eigenvalue bounds for the linearization of the corresponding nonlinear problem at the computed approximate solution. Some brief remarks on other approaches are also given in Part III. Each method in Parts I and II is accompanied by appropriate numerical examples that confirm the actual usefulness of the authors' methods. Also in some examples practical computer algorithms are supplied so that readers can easily implement the verification programs by themselves.

A primer on the underlying technologies that allow computer programs to work. Covers topics like computer hardware, combinatorial logic, sequential logic, computer architecture, computer anatomy, and Input/Output. Many coders are unfamiliar with the underlying technologies that make their programs run. But why should you care when your code appears to work? Because you want it to run well and not be riddled with hard-to-find bugs. You don't want to be in the news because your code had a security problem. Lots of technical detail is available online but it's not organized or collected into a convenient place. In The Secret Life of Programs, veteran engineer Jonathan E. Steinhart explores--in depth--the foundational concepts that underlie the machine. Subjects like computer hardware, how software behaves on hardware, as well as how people have solved problems using technology over time. You'll learn:  - How the real world is converted into a form that computers understand, like bits, logic, numbers, text, and colors - The fundamental building blocks that make up a computer including logic gates, adders, decoders, registers, and memory - Why designing programs to match computer hardware, especially memory, improves performance - How programs are converted into machine language that computers understand - How software building blocks are combined to create programs like web browsers - Clever tricks for making programs more efficient, like loop invariance, strength reduction, and recursive subdivision - The fundamentals of computer security and machine intelligence - Project design, documentation, scheduling, portability, maintenance, and other practical programming realities. Learn what really happens when your code runs on the machine and you'll learn to craft better, more efficient code.

This book is intended as an introductory lecture in material physics, in which the modern computational group theory and the electronic structure calculation are in collaboration.The first part explains how to use computer algebra for applications in solid-state simulation, based on the GAP computer algebra package. Computer algebra enables us to easily obtain various group theoretical properties, such as the representations, character tables, and subgroups. Furthermore it offers a new perspective on material design, which could be executed in a mathematically rigorous and systematic way.The second part then analyzes the relation between the structural symmetry and the electronic structure in C60 (as an example of a system without periodicity). The principal object of the study was to illustrate the hierarchical change in the quantum-physical properties of the molecule, which correlates to the reduction in the symmetry (as it descends down in the ladder of subgroups).The book also presents the computation of the vibrational modes of the C60 by means of the computer algebra. In order to serve the common interests of researchers, the details of the computations (the required initial data and the small programs developed for the purpose) are explained in as much detail as possible.

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.

This book is about machine translation (MT) and the classic problems associated with this language technology. It examines the causes of these problems and, for linguistic, rule-based systems, attributes the cause to language's ambiguity and complexity and their interplay in logic-driven processes. For non-linguistic, data-driven systems, the book attributes translation shortcomings to the very lack of linguistics. It then proposes a demonstrable way to relieve these drawbacks in the shape of a working translation model (Logos Model) that has taken its inspiration from key assumptions about psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic function. The book suggests that this brain-based mechanism is effective precisely because it bridges both linguistically driven and data-driven methodologies. It shows how simulation of this cerebral mechanism has freed this one MT model from the all-important, classic problem of complexity when coping with the ambiguities of language. Logos Model accomplishes this by a data-driven process that does not sacrifice linguistic knowledge, but that, like the brain, integrates linguistics within a data-driven process. As a consequence, the book suggests that the brain-like mechanism embedded in this model has the potential to contribute to further advances in machine translation in all its technological instantiations.

At the centre of the methodology used in this book is STEM learning variability space that includes STEM pedagogical variability, learners' social variability, technological variability, CS content variability and interaction variability. To design smart components, firstly, the STEM learning variability space is defined for each component separately, and then model-driven approaches are applied. The theoretical basis includes feature-based modelling and model transformations at the top specification level and heterogeneous meta-programming techniques at the implementation level.Practice includes multiple case studies oriented for solving the task prototypes, taken from the real world, by educational robots. These case studies illustrate the process of gaining interdisciplinary knowledge pieces identified as S-knowledge, T-knowledge, E-knowledge, M-knowledge or integrated STEM knowledge and evaluate smart components from the pedagogical and technological perspectives based on data gathered from one real teaching setting. Smart STEM-Driven Computer Science Education:  Theory, Methodology and Robot-based Practices outlines the overall capabilities of the proposed approach and also points out the drawbacks from the viewpoint of different actors, i.e. researchers, designers, teachers and learners.

A top-down, programming-oriented approach to introductory computer graphic.  Computer animation and graphics are now prevalent in everyday life from the computer screen, to the movie screen, to the smartphone screen. The growing excitement about WebGL applications and their ability to integrate HTML5, inspired the authors to exclusively use WebGL in creating  Interactive Computer Graphics --the only introduction to computer graphics text for undergraduates that fully integrates WebGL and emphasizes application-based programming. The top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the course so students immediately begin to create their own 3D graphics, while the application programming interface (API) makes it easier to teach key graphics topics, including three-dimensional transformations, lighting and shading, client-server graphics, modeling, and implementation algorithms. The new edition uses WebGL and JavaScript for all the examples.  With the 8th Edition, and for the first time,  Interactive Computer Graphics moves into the world of interactive electronic textbooks, enabling students to experiment and view code and examples while reading.

At the intersection of astronautics, computer science, and social science, this book introduces the challenges and insights associated with computer simulation of human society in outer space, and of the dynamics of terrestrial enthusiasm for space exploration. Never before have so many dynamic representations of space-related social systems existed, some deeply analyzing the logical implications of social-scientific theories, and others open for experience by the general public as computer-generated virtual worlds. Fascinating software ranges from multi-agent artificial intelligence models of civilization, to space-oriented massively multiplayer online games, to educational programs suitable for schools or even for the world's space exploration agencies. At the present time, when actual forays by humans into space are scarce, computer simulations of space societies are an excellent way to prepare for a renaissance of exploration beyond the bounds of Earth.

This book is divided into two parts. The chapters in Part I offer a comprehensive introduction to the C language and to fundamental programming concepts, followed by an explanation of realtime audio programming, including audio synthesis and processing. The chapters in Part II demonstrate how the object-oriented programming paradigm is useful in the modelling of computer music instruments, each chapter shows a set of instrument components that are paired with key C++ programming concepts. Ultimately the author discusses the development of a fully-fledged object-oriented library.  Together with its companion volume, Computer Music Instruments: Foundations, Design and Development, this book provides a comprehensive treatment of computational instruments for sound and music. It is suitable for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students in music and signal processing, and for practitioners and researchers. Some understanding of acoustics and electronic music would be helpful to understand some applications, but it's not strictly necessary to have prior knowledge of audio DSP or programming, while C / C++ programmers with no experience of audio may be able to start reading the chapters that deal with sound and music computing.

	電腦真的能像人腦一樣思考嗎？
	近年來，深度學習與人工智慧的發展都在試圖讓電腦的行為模式愈來愈接近真實的大腦，讓許多人開始好奇電腦是否真的能和大腦一樣思考，或者是否可以用電腦的邏輯來理解大腦、甚至是整個身體神經系統的運作。實際上，早在1950年代，馮紐曼就已經開始嘗試以電腦概念理解人腦作用機制。
	 
	現代電腦架構先驅馮紐曼
	現今大部分的電腦都由CPU、RAM、硬碟等部件組成，進行記憶與計算。而這種從洗衣機中的微控制器到最大的超級電腦中都找得到的架構，早在1945年就由數學家馮紐曼提出，一直沿用至今。馮紐曼可以說是二十世紀最重要的數學家，拓展了目前數學的發展方向，在電腦、物理與經濟方面也都有相當大的貢獻。
	 
	人工智慧的先驅之作
	本書就是是馮紐曼在1957年去世前為這次嘗試的講稿集結。這份講稿分兩部分，第一部分從電腦的基本原理和架構開始，以線路、處理速度與精確度等等層面一步步介紹計算與思考的本質。第二部分則接續第一部分的基礎，試圖以數學與電子傳訊的概念拆解大腦，了解我們的神經系統是如何溝通作出複雜的判斷與思考。
	 
	時至今日，馮紐曼對於神經與電腦的洞察啟發了對於電腦學習的新發現（連結主義、深度學習），也影響了現今對於人工智慧的思考方向。

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. The content applies to industries such as military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, space exploration, etc.

	電腦真的能像人腦一樣思考嗎？
	近年來，深度學習與人工智慧的發展都在試圖讓電腦的行為模式愈來愈接近真實的大腦，讓許多人開始好奇電腦是否真的能和大腦一樣思考，或者是否可以用電腦的邏輯來理解大腦、甚至是整個身體神經系統的運作。實際上，早在1950年代，馮紐曼就已經開始嘗試以電腦概念理解人腦作用機制。
	 
	現代電腦架構先驅馮紐曼
	現今大部分的電腦都由CPU、RAM、硬碟等部件組成，進行記憶與計算。而這種從洗衣機中的微控制器到最大的超級電腦中都找得到的架構，早在1945年就由數學家馮紐曼提出，一直沿用至今。馮紐曼可以說是二十世紀最重要的數學家，拓展了目前數學的發展方向，在電腦、物理與經濟方面也都有相當大的貢獻。
	 
	人工智慧的先驅之作
	本書就是是馮紐曼在1957年去世前為這次嘗試的講稿集結。這份講稿分兩部分，第一部分從電腦的基本原理和架構開始，以線路、處理速度與精確度等等層面一步步介紹計算與思考的本質。第二部分則接續第一部分的基礎，試圖以數學與電子傳訊的概念拆解大腦，了解我們的神經系統是如何溝通作出複雜的判斷與思考。
	 
	時至今日，馮紐曼對於神經與電腦的洞察啟發了對於電腦學習的新發現（連結主義、深度學習），也影響了現今對於人工智慧的思考方向。

At the centre of the methodology used in this book is STEM learning variability space that includes STEM pedagogical variability, learners' social variability, technological variability, CS content variability and interaction variability. To design smart components, firstly, the STEM learning variability space is defined for each component separately, and then model-driven approaches are applied. The theoretical basis includes feature-based modelling and model transformations at the top specification level and heterogeneous meta-programming techniques at the implementation level.Practice includes multiple case studies oriented for solving the task prototypes, taken from the real world, by educational robots. These case studies illustrate the process of gaining interdisciplinary knowledge pieces identified as S-knowledge, T-knowledge, E-knowledge, M-knowledge or integrated STEM knowledge and evaluate smart components from the pedagogical and technological perspectives based on data gathered from one real teaching setting. Smart STEM-Driven Computer Science Education:  Theory, Methodology and Robot-based Practices outlines the overall capabilities of the proposed approach and also points out the drawbacks from the viewpoint of different actors, i.e. researchers, designers, teachers and learners.

Have you always wanted to learn computer programming but you are worried it will take too long? Or perhaps you know other programming languages and are interested in learning Python quickly?Here's the deal... As a beginner you might think that programming is complex... Learning a coding language can take months, and the possibility to give up before mastering it could be high. So, if you have a project to develop you could think on hiring a professional programmer to shorten the time. This may seem like a good solution but it is certainly very expensive and if the programmer you chose doesn't perform a proper job you still have to pay for it.The best solution is to follow a complete programming manual with hands-on projects and practical exercises. Computer Programming Academy structured this guide as a course with seven chapters for seven days and studied special exercises for each section to apply what you have learned step-by-step. This protocol, tested on both total beginners and people who were already familiar with coding, takes advantage of the principle of diving, concentrating learning in one week. The result of this method has been one for both categories of students: the content of the course was learned faster and remembered longer respect the average.Inside this book, you will go through a first section in which fundamental and basic notions of programming are discussed, to get to the next chapters crafted specifically to help you learn advanced Python coding concepts required to develop web based programs and applications.In the detail, you will learn: What are the most widely used programming languages and why Python is considered the best of them to learn for a beginnerMathematical and statistic basic concepts for code writing you can't do withoutThe most common mistakes to avoid when you start programmingStep-by-step instructions to install required packages to set up a Python coding environment on your operating systemA proven strategy to write efficient and effective Python codes in less than a weekThe 7 built-in functions to make your life easier while coding a software programThe program you need to develop your first own web based applicationTips and tricks that will help you take your coding skills to a next level (an entire chapter dedicated for those who want to take a step further)Exercises and quizzes at the end of every chapter to review immediately what you've learnedExtra content that you will appreciate as curious technology enthusiastWhy is this book different?

Engineers around the world depend on MATLAB for its power, usability, and outstanding graphics capabilities. Yet too often, engineering students are either left on their own to acquire the background they need to use MATLAB, or they must learn the program concurrently within an advanced course. Both of these options delay students from solving realistic design problems, especially when they do not have a text focused on applications relevant to their field and written at the appropriate level of mathematics. Ideal for use as a short-course textbook and for self-study Elementary Mathematical and Computational Tools for Electrical and Computer Engineers Using MATLAB fills that gap. Accessible after just one semester of calculus, it introduces the many practical analytical and numerical tools that are essential to success both in future studies and in professional life. Sharply focused on the needs of the electrical and computer engineering communities, the text provides a wealth of relevant exercises and design problems. Changes in MATLAB's version 6.0 are included in a special addendum. The lack of skills in fundamental quantitative tools can seriously impede progress in one's engineering studies or career. By working through this text, either in a lecture/lab environment or by themselves, readers will not only begin mastering MATLAB, but they will also hone their analytical and computational skills to a level that will help them to enjoy and succeed in subsequent electrical and computer engineering pursuits.

Turing's fascinating and remarkable theory, which now forms the basis of computer science, explained for the general reader.In 1936, when he was just twenty-four years old, Alan Turing wrote a remarkable paper in which he outlined the theory of computation, laying out the ideas that underlie all modern computers. This groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer science. In Turing's Vision, Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turing's most important contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turing's theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the nonspecialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, ""The sheer simplicity of the theory's foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory."" Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the surprising conclusions. He also views Turing's theory in the context of mathematical history, other views of computation (including those of Alonzo Church), Turing's later work, and the birth of the modern computer.In the paper, ""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,"" Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that there were problems that were beyond any computer's ability to solve; in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove was undecidable. To explain Turing's ideas, Bernhardt examines three well-known decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability; investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines; explains universal machines; and proves that certain problems are undecidable, including Turing's problem concerning computable numbers.

With Kubernetes, it is possible and easy for you to automate the deployment, management, and scaling of any containerized applications. You can use this container to group containers which make up a particular application into a number of logical units to make it easy for discovery and management. This container operates by use of the same technique which makes Google run many containers numbering in the billions on a weekly basis, and it can scale and you will not be required to increase the ops team. Kubernetes is a very flexible container, whether you are running it locally or on a global enterprise, and it will allow you to be able to deliver your container in an easier and more consistent manner despite how complex it might be. It is open source, and you are able to move your workloads to where you need. A large number of major companies appreciate the potential to save on costs when it comes to containers and Kubernetes. In particular, containers are more lightweight than VMs and can share a single OS, which causes a significant decrease in the costs of infrastructure. Their maintenance costs are also low. Additionally, they have faster CI/CD pipelines and allow your development and engineering teams better coordination with each other. Adding Kubernetes to the equation more benefits are gained. By autoscaling you can save more. The other benefits include efficient application scheduling, efficient cluster-level resource management, and rolling updates. - How Kubernetes operates- Deployment- Kubernetes pods- Kubernetes services- Kubernetes design patterns- Kubernetes cliene libraries and extensions- Logging- The intricacies of this management plane in Kubernetes- Cluster federation- Kubernetes ingress...And much moreOverall, you can expect to save your team's time and also make a two-digit saving all thanks to both containerized applications and container orchestration. Applications are deployed through containers focusing on operating-system-level virtualization as opposed to hardware virtualization. This enables us to put an end to the limitations of the host by selecting executable file-systems, libraries, and etc. With Kubernetes, connecting applications with appropriate services through configuring firewalls of the cloud service providers can be made at once. In complex configurations, it creates an external load-balancer and discovering cross-cluster service through the use of federated services.

Traditionally, genetics laboratory exercises at the university level focus on mono- and dihybrid crosses and phenotypic analysis--exercises under traditional time, materials, and process constraints. Lately, molecular techniques such as gene cloning, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and bioinformatics are being included in many teaching laboratories--where affordable. Human chromosome analysis, when present at all, has often been restricted to simple identification of chromosomes by number, through the usual ""cut-and-paste"" method. Although several online karyotyping (chromosome identification) programs have become available, they are not meaningful for studying the dynamics of the chromosome system, nor do they help students understand genetics as a discipline. The software that accompanies this book has been shown to be an ideal tool for learning about genetics, which requires a combination of understanding, conceptualization, and practical experience.

This book provides an introduction to logic and mathematical induction which are the basis of any deductive computational framework. A strong mathematical foundation of the logical engines available in modern proof assistants, such as the PVS verification system, is essential for computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers to increment their capabilities to provide formal proofs of theorems and to certify the robustness of software and hardware systems. The authors present a concise overview of the necessary computational and mathematical aspects of 'logic', placing emphasis on both natural deduction and sequent calculus. Differences between constructive and classical logic are highlighted through several examples and exercises. Without neglecting classical aspects of computational logic, the authors also highlight the connections between logical deduction rules and proof commands in proof assistants, presenting simple examples of formalizations of the correctness of algebraic functions and algorithms in PVS.  Applied Logic for Computer Scientists will not only benefit students of computer science and mathematics but also software, hardware, automation, electrical and mechatronic engineers who are interested in the application of formal methods and the related computational tools to provide mathematical certificates of the quality and accuracy of their products and technologies.

The first hopeful book about climate change, The Future Earth shows readers how to reverse the short- and long-term effects of climate change over the next three decades.The basics of climate science are easy. We know it is entirely human-caused. Which means its solutions will be similarly human-led. In The Future Earth, leading climate change advocate and weather-related journalist Eric Holthaus (""the Rebel Nerd of Meteorology""--Rolling Stone) offers a radical vision of our future, specifically how to reverse the short- and long-term effects of climate change over the next three decades. Anchored by world-class reporting, interviews with futurists, climatologists, biologists, economists, and climate change activists, it shows what the world could look like if we implemented radical solutions on the scale of the crises we face. What could happen if we reduced carbon emissions by 50 percent in the next decade?What could living in a city look like in 2030?How could the world operate in 2040, if the proposed Green New Deal created a 100 percent net carbon-free economy in the United States?This is the book for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the current state of our environment. Hopeful and prophetic, The Future Earth invites us to imagine how we can reverse the effects of climate change in our own lifetime and encourages us to enter a deeper relationship with the earth as conscientious stewards and to re-affirm our commitment to one another in our shared humanity.

In this Very Short Introduction, Subrata Dasgupta sheds light on these lesser known areas and considers the conceptual basis of computer science. Discussing algorithms, programming, and sequential and parallel processing, he considers emerging modern ideas such as biological computing and cognitive modelling, challenging the idea of computer science as a science of the artificial. ABOUT THE SERIES:  The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.

The Rise of the Computer State is a comprehensive examination of the ways that computers and massive databases are enabling the nation's corporations and law enforcement agencies to steadily erode our privacy and manipulate and control the American people. This book was written in 1983 as a warning. Today it is a history. Most of its grim scenarios are now part of everyday life. The remedy proposed here, greater public oversight of industry and government, has not occurred, but a better one has not yet been found. While many individuals have willingly surrendered much of their privacy and all of us have lost some of it, the right to keep what remains is still worth protecting.

	Leading networking authority Douglas Comer presents a wide-ranging, self-contained tour of the concepts, principles, and technologies that enable today’s Internet to support applications ranging from web browsing to telephony and multimedia. Comer begins by illuminating the applications and facilities offered by today’s Internet. Next, he systematically introduces the underlying network technologies and protocols that make them possible. With these concepts and technologies established, he introduces several of the most important contemporary issues faced by network implementers and managers, including quality of service, Internet telephony, multimedia, network security, and network management. Comer has carefully designed this book to support both top-down and bottom-up teaching approaches. Students need no background in operating systems, and no sophisticated math: Comer relies throughout on figures, drawings, examples, and analogies, not mathematical proofs.Appropriate for all introductory-to-intermediate courses in computer networking, the Internet, or Internet applications; students need no background in networking, operating systems, or advanced mathematics.

本書特色

Broad Coverage of Key Concepts and Principles, Presented in a Technology-independent Fashion- Drawing on more than 30 years’ experience at the leading edge of networking research and implementation, Comer focuses on imparting knowledge that students will need regardless of which technologies emerge or become obsolete.- Every chapter includes hands-on exercises and projects that offer opportunities for students to test their knowledge and gain confidence in their abilities.

	2. Flexible Organization that Supports both Top-down and Bottom-up Teaching Approaches- The text is organized into five parts. Chapters may be sequenced in multiple orders to accommodate a wide variety of instructor/student/course needs and preferences.- This text combines the best of top-down and bottom-up approaches. When presented in order, the book exposes students to applications and allows them to write network programs early, while delivering all material in logical order so a reader understands how each new technology builds on lower layer technologies.

	3. An Accessible Presentation that Resonates with Students- No sophisticated mathematics is required—instead of formal mathematical proofs, Comer presents highly accessible examples, figures, drawings, and analogies.- The text answers the basic question: how do computer networks and Internets operate? It provides a comprehensive, self-contained tour through all of networking that describes applications, Internet protocols, network technologies, such as LANs and WANs, and low-level details, such as data transmission and wiring. It shows how protocols use the underlying hardware and how applications use the protocol stack to provide functionality for users.

This thought-provoking analysis evaluates the progress that global society has made since the Enlightenment. The author begins by pointing out features of present-day society that are the direct descendants of the Enlightenment's discoveries and advances: our technology, modern medicine, science-based worldview, democratic political institutions, and concepts of human rights are all an outgrowth of the pioneering efforts of Enlightenment reformers. But along with these benefits, the author notes that we are also the inheritors of some significant problems produced in the wake of these advances; overpopulation, nuclear proliferation, and global climate change are just some of the recent developments that seem to threaten the whole Enlightenment project. Other great concerns include the continuing economic disparity between prosperous and impoverished nations, the persistence of widespread ignorance, and destructive reactionary forces bent on provoking new conflicts. Despite these and other daunting challenges of the twenty-first century, the author concludes on a cautiously optimistic note, predicting that the Enlightenment vision of prosperity, security, justice, and good health for all will eventually be achieved.

The contentious history of the computer programmers who developed the software that made the computer revolution possible.This is a book about the computer revolution of the mid-twentieth century and the people who made it possible. Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer specialists--programmers, systems analysts, and other software developers--who transformed the electronic computer from a scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series of critiques of the social and organizational impact of electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed the ""computer boys"" were taking over, not just in the corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society in general.In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and women (a surprising number of the ""computer boys"" were, in fact, female) who built their careers around the novel technology of electronic computing explores issues of power, identity, and expertise that have only become more significant in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally human development.

Created in 1946 as part of a 1,000 page Report on the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), this ENIAC Operating Manual provides a fascinating glimpse into the technology behind the world's first electronic, general-purpose computer. Designed and built during WWII at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC was conceived by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. It was financed by the Ordnance Department of the U.S. Army. The Army's intent was to use it to calculate artillery firing tables but ENIAC's digital, Turing-complete design meant that it could solve a wide range of problems. Eventually it was even used to compute data for the design of the hydrogen bomb. ENIAC represented a remarkable advance in technology. Its speed was 1000x faster than the electro-mechanical machines that preceded it, and it relied on no moving parts to produce calculations. Famously, the ENIAC contained almost 17,500 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors and 10,000 capacitors, and took up nearly 1800 square feet while consuming 150 kW of power. While vacuum tube technology was not the most reliable owing to frequent burn-outs, the ENIAC operated roughly 50% of the time it was in service. ENIAC was composed of individual panels that performed different functions, with numbers passed between the units by buses. It could be programmed to perform a variety of now-familiar operations including loops, branches and subroutines, and could hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. It even had the ability to branch - triggering different operations depending on the sign of a computed result - and could print results to an IBM punch card. Programming the ENIAC was not easy and often took weeks of work, some of it spent mapping out the problem and much of it spent setting up the computer's numerous switches and cables. Created by the University of Pennsylvania in fulfillment of their contract, this ENIAC Operating Manual was originally restricted, and its publication limited to just 25 copies. Within its pages you'll find a complete set of instructions for the operation of the computer, primarily in the form of diagrams that explain the functionality of various panels. While it includes very little explanatory material concerning the circuits of the machine (this being the topic of another portion of the report, the ""Technical Description of the ENIAC""), it nevertheless provides a unique insight into the operation of one of history's most important computers.

In The Vision Revolution, Mark Changizi, prominent neuroscientist and vision expert, addresses four areas of human vision and provides explanations for why we have those particular abilities, complete with a number of full-color illustrations to demonstrate his conclusions and to engage the reader. Written for both the casual reader and the science buff hungry for new information, The Vision Revolution is a resource that dispels commonly believed perceptions about sight and offers answers drawn from the field's most recent research. Changizi focuses on four ""why"" questions: 1. Why do we see in color?2. Why do our eyes face forward?3. Why do we see illusions?4. Why does reading come so naturally to us?  The Vision Revolution explores phenomena such as cyclopses, peeking and many more you hadn't even thought to wonder about. Changizi shows how deeply involved these evolutionary aspects of our vision are in why we see the way we do--and what the future holds for us.  The Vision Revolution is a book that finally gives attention to what before has been largely neglected by other works on human vision--a book that looks at the ""why.""

Sooner or later, all game programmers run into coding issues that require an understanding of mathematics or physics concepts such as collision detection, 3D vectors, transformations, game theory, or basic calculus. Unfortunately, most programmers frequently have a limited understanding of these essential mathematics and physics concepts. MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS FOR PROGRAMMERS, THIRD EDITION provides a simple but thorough grounding in the mathematics and physics topics that programmers require to write algorithms and programs using a non-language-specific approach. Applications and examples from game programming are included throughout, and exercises follow each chapter for additional practice. The book's companion website provides sample code illustrating the mathematical and physics topics discussed in the book.

In The Vision Revolution, Mark Changizi, prominent neuroscientist and vision expert, addresses four areas of human vision and provides explanations for why we have those particular abilities, complete with a number of full-color illustrations to demonstrate his conclusions and to engage the reader. Written for both the casual reader and the science buff hungry for new information, The Vision Revolution is a resource that dispels commonly believed perceptions about sight and offers answers drawn from the field's most recent research. Changizi focuses on four ""why"" questions: 1. Why do we see in color?2. Why do our eyes face forward?3. Why do we see illusions?4. Why does reading come so naturally to us? Why Do We See in Color?It was commonly believed that color vision evolved to help our primitive ancestors identify ripe fruit. Changizi says we should look closer to home: ourselves. Human color vision evolved to give us greater insights into the mental states and health of other people. People who can see color changes in skin have an advantage over their color-blind counterparts; they can see when people are blushing with embarrassment, purple-faced with exertion or the reddening of rashes. Changizi's research reveals that the cones in our eyes that allow us to see color are exquisitely designed exactly for seeing color changes in the skin. And it's no coincidence that the primates with color vision are the ones with bare spots on their faces and other body parts; Changizi shows that the development of color vision in higher primates closely parallels the loss of facial hair, culminating in the near hairlessness and highly developed color vision of humans. Why Do Our Eyes Face Forward?Forward-facing eyes set us apart from most mammals, and there is much dispute as to why we have them. While some speculate that we evolved this feature to give us depth perception available through stereo vision, this type of vision only allows us to see short distances, and we already have other mechanisms that help us to estimate distance. Changizi's research shows that with two forward-facing eyes, primates and humans have an x-ray ability. Specifically, we're able to see through the cluttered leaves of the forest environment in which we evolved. This feature helps primates see their targets in a crowded, encroached environment. To see how this works, hold a finger in front of your eyes. You'll find that you're able to look ""through"" it, at what is beyond your finger. One of the most amazing feats of two forward-facing eyes? Our views aren't blocked by our noses, beaks, etc. Why Do We See Illusions?We evolved to see moving objects, not where they are, but where they are going to be. Without this ability, we couldn't catch a ball because the brain's ability to process visual information isn't fast enough to allow us to put our hands in the right place to intersect for a rapidly approaching baseball. ""If our brains simply created a perception of the way the world was at the time light hit the eye, then by the time that perception was elicited--which takes about a tenth of a second for the brain to do--time would have marched on, and the perception would be of the recent past,"" Changizi explains. Simply put, illusions occur when our brain is tricked into thinking that a stationary two-dimensional picture has an element that is moving. Our brains project the ""moving"" element into the future and, as a result, we don't see what's on the page, but what our brain thinks will be the case a fraction of a second into the future. Why Does Reading Come So Naturally to Us?We can read faster than we can hear, which is odd, considering that reading is relatively recent, and we've evolved to process speech for millions of years. Changizi's research reveals that language has been carefully designed to tap in to elements of the visual processing center that have evolved for tens of millions of years. Vis

Ever wonder what it would be like to get inside the head of an accomplished photographer as he chooses a subject, works the scene, selects an image, and then edits the result into a piece of photographic art?As a follow-up to his successful first book Take Your Photography To The Next Level, author/photographer George Barr now applies the practice to the theory. Go along with George as he searches for subjects, sorts out scenes, refines his composition, and then moves from Camera to Computer to edit his images, not only correcting flaws, but making the images match his vision.You'll see proof sheets and ""not quite there"" images, and you'll learn tips on image editing from someone who is focused on creating a fine art image rather than mass producing many similar images-often the goal of commercial photographers.With his friendly, easy-to-understand approach George goes beyond how to edit your images by teaching the whys behind the editing process. This book is certain to help you dramatically improve your own images.Topics include: Finding photographic subjectsWorking the scenePractical issues in compositionWhat to change in a captured imageHow to edit your images-a practical, easy workflow

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the fields of pattern recognition and machine vision in academia and industries. New theories have been developed with new technology and systems designs in both hardware and software. They are widely applied to our daily life to solve real problems in diverse areas such as science, engineering, agriculture, e-commerce, education, robotics, government, medicine, games and animation, medical imaging analysis and diagnosis, military, and national security.The foundation of this field can be traced back to the late Prof. King-Sun Fu, one of the founding fathers of pattern recognition, who, with visionary insight, founded the International Association for Pattern Recognition in 1978. Almost 30 years later, the world has witnessed this field's rapid growth and development. It is probably true to say that most people are affected by or use applications of pattern recognition in daily life.Today, on the eve of 25th anniversary of the unfortunate and untimely passing of Prof. Fu, we are proud to produce this collection works from world renowned professionals and experts in pattern recognition and machine vision in honor and memory of the late Prof. King-Sun Fu. We hope this book will help further promote not only fundamental principles, systems, and technologies but also the vast range of applications that help in solving problems in daily life.

More and more senior citizens are exploring the exciting opportunities that computers present. Unfortunately, along with the joys come the headaches: baffling error messages, a computer or program that simply won't behave as it should, the ever-present fear of viruses and spyware, and perhaps worst of all, not knowing where to turn for help. Tech support lines are expensive and unreliable, often offering complex solutions to simple problems, and of course, printed manuals are a thing of the past. Computer Help for Seniors in Easy Steps is the perfect alternative. In clear, everyday English, it troubleshoots all parts of a computer system, providing easy-to-follow instructions that guide users step-by-step to a successful conclusion. It also examines the most common issues users experience with Windows, the Internet, and email, and offers effective prevention measures that ensure browsing the Web remains a safe and enjoyable experience.

Personal computing has reshaped economies and industries, and is transforming how we express ourselves and relate to one another. The most personal of personal computers are the portables. We carry these gadgets with us wherever we go, whether they're laptops, smartphones, or the coolest new Web-surfing devices. The Race for Perfect tells the story of two generations of entrepreneurs, designers, and engineers as they have struggled to make ever-better portables. Steve Hamm takes the reader into a world where inspiration, design, engineering, and marketing come together to produce wave upon wave of the innovative products that we love to talk about and use. From the earliest days of portable computing, 40 years ago, entrepreneurs and designers have pushed forward relentlessly in a quest to create the perfect device. Their efforts have produced a few fabulous successes and many failures. But they never give up. They're driven by the basic rule of the tech industry: innovate or die. In addition to a fascinating read, The Race for Perfect offers valuable lessons for business people in any industry, revealing how they must INNOVATE constantly to differentiate their products CREATE design principles that are timeless INTEGRATE design and engineering so products are both useful and fun to use IMPROVE quality and convenience without compromise TAP social networks to turn customers into fans At the center of this tale is the story of a single product, Lenovo's ThinkPad X300 laptop. Lenovo, the first Chinese company to seek to establish a global consumer brand, bought IBM's PC division in 2005 primarily to get the company's storied ThinkPad laptops. The X300 was conceived as a ""halo"" product that would draw customers to Lenovo's entire line. Woven through The Race for Perfect is a case study of how this ambitious company, with teams in Japan, the United States, and China, marshaled its resources to pursue laptop perfection. As X300 came close to the finish line, it collided head-on with Apple's super-slim MacBook Air---with surprising results.

Building a computer can be a very rewarding experience. You can learn a lot about computer hardware by building a computer. Aside from that, you get a totally personalized computer that no OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) could match, and there is also the opportunity to save a lot of money in the process. The only downside is that you won't have any technical support number to ring, or any centralized warranty service (each part will have its own warranty/return policy), so there may be a chance that you will have to pay more for service (if you don't repair yourself). So now you've been sold on the merits, read on to find out how...

The International Ergonomics Association (IEA) is currently developing standards for Ergonomic Quality in Design (EQUID) which primarily intends to promote ergonomics principles and the adaptation of a process approach for the development of products, work systems and services. It is important to assess the ergonomic quality of products, hand-held tools and computer input devices through working processes that represent reality. Well-designed working tools can be expected to reduce or eliminate fatigue, discomfort, accidents and health problems and they can lead to improvements in productivity and quality. Furthermore, absenteeism, job turnover and training costs can positively be influenced by the working tools and the environment. Not all these short-term and long-term issues of working tools can be quantified in pragmatically oriented ergonomic research approaches. But multi-channel electromyography, which enables the measurement of the physiological costs of the muscles involved in handling tools during standardized working tests, and subjective assessments of experienced subjects enable a reliable insight in the essential ergonomic criteria of working tools and products. In this respect it is advantageous to provide a test procedure, in which working tests can be carried out alternating both with test objects and reference models.

隨著電腦技術的快速發展，計算機圖學技術也有了更高一層的發展，CAD系統取代了傳統的手工設計，電視廣告也加入了許多電腦特效，電影、遊戲更大量運用了3D特效與虛擬實境技術，由此可見，計算機圖學的應用已經深入我們的生活中。既然計算機圖學的應用如此重要，想跨入這個設計領域，當然得先學習這方面的技術，但市面上卻少有相關基礎知識與概念的書籍，大部分都著重在軟體的教學與應用，因此，這本書的出版更顯得重要。本書主要介紹計算機圖學的相關原理與演算法，除了講述電腦圖學的基礎知識外，更著重在演算法的使用，以啟發讀者的思考，培養其獨立研究與應用的能力。

In this remarkably illustrative and thoroughly accessible look at one of the most intriguing frontiers in science and computers, award-winning New York Times writer George Johnson reveals the fascinating world of quantum computing--the holy grail of super computers where the computing power of single atoms is harnassed to create machines capable of almost unimaginable calculations in the blink of an eye. As computer chips continue to shrink in size, scientists anticipate the end of the road: A computer in which each switch is comprised of a single atom. Such a device would operate under a different set of physical laws: The laws of quantum mechanics. Johnson gently leads the curious outsider through the surprisingly simple ideas needed to understand this dream, discussing the current state of the revolution, and ultimately assessing the awesome power these machines could have to change our world.

 Every computer crime leaves tracks--you just have to know where to find them. This book shows you how to collect and analyze the digital evidence left behind in a digital crime scene.   Computers have always been susceptible to unwanted intrusions, but as the sophistication of computer technology increases so does the need to anticipate, and safeguard against, a corresponding rise in computer-related criminal activity.   Computer forensics, the newest branch of computer security, focuses on the aftermath of a computer security incident. The goal of computer forensics is to conduct a structured investigation to determine exactly what happened, who was responsible, and to perform the investigation in such a way that the results are useful in a criminal proceeding.   Written by two experts in digital investigation,  Computer Forensics  provides extensive information on how to handle the computer as evidence. Kruse and Heiser walk the reader through the complete forensics process--from the initial collection of evidence through the final report. Topics include an overview of the forensic relevance of encryption, the examination of digital evidence for clues, and the most effective way to present your evidence and conclusions in court. Unique forensic issues associated with both the Unix and the Windows NT/2000 operating systems are thoroughly covered.   This book provides a detailed methodology for collecting, preserving, and effectively using evidence by addressing the three A's of computer forensics:    Acquire the evidence without altering or damaging the original data.  Authenticate that your recorded evidence is the same as the original seized data.  Analyze the data without modifying the recovered data.    Computer Forensics  is written for everyone who is responsible for investigating digital criminal incidents or who may be interested in the techniques that such investigators use. It is equally helpful to those investigating hacked web servers, and those who are investigating the source of illegal pornography.   0201707195B09052001

為何已維持三十五億年單純形式的生命，
會在寒武紀時演化大爆炸？


◎2017全新增訂版，增修地質年代與彩色照片
◎美國AMAZON讀者四顆星推薦
◎國立自然科學博物館 程延年博士 專文導讀
◎解開寒武紀大爆發之謎的經典重現

	什麼是寒武紀大爆發？

	早在五億四千四百萬年前，單細胞生物就已在地球上出沒，當時的動物物種只有三個動物門。而在短短的五百萬年後(這段時期僅占生物演化史的千分之一)，這三個動物門的物種突然演化成三十八個動物門，幾乎現今所有動物的祖先，全在一瞬間蜂湧而出。這個物種快速暴增的現象發生在寒武紀初期，稱為寒武紀大爆發，是演化史上的劃時代事件。

	什麼原因導致寒武紀大爆發？

	自達爾文發表《物種起源》始，寒武紀大爆發一直被視為演化上的謎團。為了解開謎團，眾多地質學家、古生物學家和演化學家皆提出各式各樣的假說，卻也接二連三地被推翻。牛津大學動物學家派克於2003年再度挑戰這個連達爾文也感到困惑的千古難題，他以大膽假設、小心求證的科學精神，全面檢查遠古化石證據，提出一個簡單又極具說服力的解釋：光開關理論。

	2017年倫敦自然史博物館全新修訂出版

	派克於2003年出版本書後，立即奠定了古生物學界的大師地位。歷時十三年，這本書引發眾多的討論，在在驗證本書理論的正確性，甚而被引申為人類文化活動突然壓力事件的模型等。本書在2003年時原由大眾讀物出版社出版，2016年時由倫敦自然史博物館全新出版，不僅增訂了全書的地質年代，並由作者增補彩色照片與黑白圖說，更確定本書的可靠性與正確性。2017年繁體中文版即為2016年倫敦自然史博物館所修訂的最新版本，完整呈現。

In its first five years of existence, The Perl Journal ran 247 articles by over 120 authors. Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. TPJ explained critical topics such as regular expressions, databases, and object-oriented programming, and demonstrated Perl's utility for fields as diverse as astronomy, biology, economics, AI, and games. The magazine gave birth to both the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the Perl Poetry contest, and remains a proud and timeless achievement of Perl during one of its most exciting periods of development. Computer Science and Perl Programming is the first volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. This volume has 70 articles devoted to hard-core computer science, advanced programming techniques, and the underlying mechanics of Perl. Here's a sample of what you'll find inside: Jeffrey Friedl on Understanding Regexes Mark Jason Dominus on optimizing your Perl programs with Memoization Damian Conway on Parsing Tim Meadowcroft on integrating Perl with Microsoft Office Larry Wall on the culture of Perl Written by 41 of the most prominent and prolific members of the closely-knit Perl community, this anthology does what no other book can, giving unique insight into the real-life applications and powerful techniques made possible by Perl. Other books tell you how to use Perl, but this book goes far beyond that: it shows you not only how to use Perl, but what you could use Perl for. This is more than just The Best of the Perl Journal -- in many ways, this is the best of Perl.

Simply put, an algorithm is a set of instructions-it's the code that makes computers run. A basic idea that proved elusive for hundreds of years and bent the minds of the greatest thinkers in the world, the algorithm is what made the modern world possible. Without the algorithm, there would have been no computer, no Internet, no virtual reality, no e-mail, or any other technological advance that we rely on every day.In The Advent of the Algorithm,  David Berlinski combines science, history, and math to explain and explore the intriguing story of how the algorithm was finally discovered by a succession of mathematicians and logicians, and how this paved the way for the digital age. Beginning with Leibniz and culminating in the middle of the twentieth century with the groundbreaking work of G繹del and Turing, The Advent of the Algorithm is an epic tale told with clarity and imaginative brilliance.

在1969年登陸月球之後
 人類史上另一次深入太空的載人任務
 這一次我們的目標是——火星！


 「阿姆斯壯是第一個踏上月球的人類，我則是由地外世界前往地球、首先跨入太空船的第一人。」

 到2035年之前，太空人能登陸火星嗎？
 到了那個時候，繁忙人流與物流是否已經在內太陽系穿梭往返，
 以地球、月球和火星的內側衛星火衛一為三大集散地？
 我們能不能把全地球的力量集合起來，
 一同探索這個最有可能成為人類第二個居住地的行星？

 最早的踏上月球的人類之一巴茲‧艾德林：「絕對可以！」
 　　
 全球知名太空人、優秀工程師、暢銷書作家艾德林相信，這件事不但辦得到，對人類的未來更是至關重要，人類必須以探索、科學、開發、商業和保安為目的，持續往外開拓太空新領域。

 艾德林認為，身為全球太空發展的領導國家，美國需要的是總統的登高一呼──像當年甘迺迪承諾在1960年代結束之前踏上月球的那番話那樣激勵人心──和一個統一的太空願景。

在前進火星之前：

 ●不要再派太空人上月球了！
 2010年4月15日，美國總統歐巴馬整頓美國太空計畫，否決前總統小布希提出的太空探險願景計畫（Vision for Space Exploration），「有些人認為我們應該按照計畫，先嘗試重返月球。但我必須直言……我們已經去過那裡，巴茲去過了。太空中還有更多地方等待探索，探索的同時還有很多事情要學。」重新訂定當前太空任務的目標——登陸火星。

 ●新時代的旅行方式：太空漫遊
 目前已有少數人支付2000 -3500萬美元的票價，接受訓練並利用俄羅斯的聯合號太空船前往國際太空站，多家公司正在開發次軌道太空旅遊的機會。未來幾年內，公眾將能選擇次軌道航行。太空探索帶來全新的旅遊景點，太空旅遊業將是下一個新興行業，星際郵輪、近地軌道旅館，這些都不會只是科幻小說的幻想。

 ●全球太空經濟：這是一門好生意
 《2012年太空報告：全球太空活動權威指南》指出，2011年全球各地在太空經濟將近成長了2900億美元。在全球許多領域經濟低迷的情勢下，這個令人驚訝的數字反映它在單一年度擴增了12.2 %，而且在五年裡成長41%，太空經濟帶來了巨大的社會經濟利益。

 在《前進火星》書中，艾德林擘劃出一套發展方向，強調美國應該重新擔負起太空探索的領導角色，如此將對美國和全世界的經濟和科技活力帶來重大助益。

 你敢作大夢嗎？那就加入艾德林這場發人深省的任務，一起前進火星吧！

Learning Carbon is designed to get you programming right away in Carbon(TM), one of two APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces) Macintosh(R) programmers can use to write applications that run native in Mac(R) OS X. Using Carbon, you don't have to rewrite your Mac OS programs entirely to get them to take advantage of the new features in Mac OS X. Instead, all you have to rewrite is the 10 to 20 percent of the code that can't be translated to OS X. For C programmers, Apple's Carbon is the essential building block for applications on Mac OS X. With Carbon, you can use simple, traditional C interfaces to create world-class applications for a world-class operating system.After orienting you with a detailed tour of a Carbon application, Learning Carbon walks you through the entire process of designing and creating a complete Carbon application called Moon Travel Planner. Along the way, you'll be introduced to two pivotal development tools: Project Builder and Interface Builder. You'll learn key concepts about Carbon and Mac OS X programming, including event management, resource handling, and bundle anatomy. And you'll get direct, hands-on instruction on how to implement essential application tasks, such as managing windows, printing documents, opening and saving files, creating and responding to menu commands, providing user help, and organizing your application for easy localization in multiple countries and languages. After finishing this book, you'll be ready to start writing your own Carbon applications.Written by Apple insiders with access to engineers deeply involved in creating Mac OS X, Learning Carbon brings you information that's not available anywhere else, to get you in on the ground floor of the exciting new Mac OS X application development market.
