This volume explores options for a sustainable maritime domain, including maritime transportation, such as, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP), maritime education and training, maritime traffic and advisory systems, maritime security. Other activities in the maritime domain covered in the book include small-scale fisheries and sustainable fisheries, and greening the blue economy. The book aims to provide the building blocks needed for a framework for good ocean governance; a framework that will serve through the next decade and, and hopefully, well beyond the 2030 milepost of the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development. In short, this book brings together the problems of the current world and sustainable solutions that are in the development process and will eventually materialize in the not so distant future. Additionally, the book presents a trans-disciplinary analysis of integral sustainable maritime transportation solutions and crucial issues relevant to good ocean governance that have recently been discussed at different national, regional and international fora, highlighting ongoing work to develop and support governance systems that facilitate industry requirements, and meet the needs of coastal states and indigenous peoples, of researchers, of spatial planners, and of other sectors dependent on the oceans.The book will be of interest to researchers across many disciplines, especially those that are engaged in cross-sectoral research and developments in the maritime transport sector and across the wider maritime domain. To this end, the book covers areas including natural and social sciences, geographical studies, spatial planning, maritime security and gender studies, as they relate to transport and the wider maritime sector. In addition, the book explores frameworks for sustainable ocean governance being developed under the UN's Agenda for Sustainable Development to 2030. It will also look beyond the 2030 milepost under that Agenda, and will be of use to national and international policymakers and practitioners, government actors at the EU and other regional and national levels and to researchers of ocean governance, sustainability and management, and maritime transport.

Mobile agents are preponderating the internet technology that actually were part of / are software components that incorporate data which were able to migrate from one node to another in a network. These mobile agents are also used to exploit the security challenges in the inter-networking domain. But the successful employment of the mobile agents as part of the security mechanism is being effected by the diverse range of factors like performance, efficiency, ability to identify the intruders, and the models vulnerability to direct attacks and so-on which make the successful deployment of the mobile agents in the security domain challenging. These factors arise because of the wide area of focus and in merging the two very different ideas of technology the mobile agents and the security. Therefore it's often demanding to identify a security mechanism that entails the performance by making use of the mobile agents in the network security domain. Also on the contrary the mechanism need to be generic and should support all kinds of the environments in answering the challenges.

Future broadband wireless communication systems are expected to offer new and powerful services enabling fast transmission rates of several tens of Mbit/s. This is an ambitious challenge, especially for mobile communication systems, since these systems should be able to cope with several time dispersive channels associated with the signal multipath propagation. Moreover, these systems should have high spectral and power efficiencies as well as high capacity and flexibility. Spread spectrum techniques, particularly coded division multiple access (CDMA) techniques allow high capacity and flexibility, continuous transmission requiring low-peak power requirements for the amplifiers, and some robustness against fading and time-dispersion effects associated with the multipath propagation. When employed in prefix assisted (PA) block transmission schemes combined with frequency-domain receiver implementations, they become especially interesting for broadband wireless systems. In Frequency-Domain Multiuser Detection for CDMA Systems, the use of PA block transmission is considered in the context of both DS (Direct Sequence) and MC (Multicarrier) CDMA schemes. The main focus of this publication is the study of frequency-domain multiuser detection techniques with iterative signal detection/decoding techniques, also in combination with estimation and cancelation of nonlinear distortion effects. The receiver structures are suitable to scenarios with high interference levels and strongly time-dispersive channels.

Technological evolution and revolution are both driven by the discovery of new functionalities, new materials and the design of yet smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient components. Progress is being made at a breathtaking pace, stimulated by the rapidly growing demand for more powerful and readily available information technology. High-speed internet and data-streaming, home automation, tablets and smartphones are now ""necessities"" for our everyday lives. Consumer expectations for progressively more data storage and exchange appear to be insatiable. In this context, ferroic domain walls have attracted recent attention as a completely new type of oxide interface. In addition to their functional properties, such walls are spatially mobile and can be created, moved, and erased on demand. This unique degree of flexibility enables domain walls to take an active role in future devices and hold a great potential as multifunctional 2D systems for nanoelectronics. With domain walls as reconfigurable electronic 2D components, a new generation of adaptive nano-technology and flexible circuitry becomes possible, that can be altered and upgraded throughout the lifetime of the device. Thus, what started out as fundamental research, at the limit of accessibility, is finally maturing into a promising concept for next-generation technology.

Revision with unchanged content. The prediction of protein structural domains and their boundaries from amino acid sequence data is an open problem of interest to the bio-informatics community. Determining a protein's structural domains experi-mentally can be very difficult. The assignment of structural domains relies on the time-consuming process of determining the three-dimensional structure. There is a strong potential for computational methods to aid in this and other tasks in structural molecular biology. Efforts from other researchers, along with the results presented here indicate that boundaries can indeed be predicted from amino acid sequence alone. A new machine-learning based architecture is introduced to predict structural domain boundaries, the key feature of which is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The MoE provides the ability to combine the predictions of individual classifiers, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and na簿ve Bayes classifiers, so as to optimize prediction accuracy. This book is addressed to students and researchers in both computer science and bioinformatics.

Revision with unchanged content. In the last years, the Web has become an invaluable source of information for almost every domain of knowledge. This has motivated researchers to considering the Web as a valid repository for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition. In this sense, Ontology Learning from web resources is a particularly interesting topic as Ontologies are required to achieve interoperability and information understanding in knowledge intensive environments such as the Semantic Web. This book analyzes the ontology construction process from the automatic learning point of view. It presents a novel approach for Ontology Learning, introducing new methods for knowledge acquisition from the Web. The adaptation of several learning techniques to the web corpus and the exploitation of particular characteristics of the Web environment composing an automatic, un-supervised and domain independent approach distinguishes the present proposal from previous works. The discussion, methods and results presented in this work should help researchers interested in taking profit from the information available in the Web and to create a consistent base of ontologies required for the Semantic Web.

To build knowledge-based systems / expert systems is an attempt to capture rare or important expertise and embody it in computer programs. It is done by talking to the people who have that expertise. In one sense building expert systems is a form of intellectual cloning. Expert system builders, the knowledge engineers, find out from experts what they know and how they use their knowledge to solve problems. Once this debriefing is done, the expert system builders incorporate the knowledge and expertise in computer programs, making the knowledge and expertise easily replicated, readily distributed, and essentially immortal. Knowledge-based system is a research sub-domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The author has taken Transfer of Property Act of Indian Legal domain for the development of the expert system. The Transfer of Property Act is the most used act in Indian Legal domain by all citizens. This work will help a common man in understanding the aspect of this act.

As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are now taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn't always straightforward.With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity--and get the most value out of their test suites.Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)Domain-driven design's distinction between entities, value objects, and aggregatesRepository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storageEvents, commands, and the message busCommand-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices

This second edition of the book Green Web-II - Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN Program / Policy Development in Environment Conservation Domain: with reference to India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh investigates the IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states of South Asia with different capacities. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in biodiversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at the global, regional and country levels. This book adds to our knowledge firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have previously been mainly the subject of political science. Secondly, it critically explores one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Finally, the research also shows the historical development of global institutions and IUCN's activities with member nations in helping to define or redefine the concept of global governance. The outcomes of this research will also be beneficial for global collaboration, networking, and for the identification of common concerns among the many environmental and conservational organizations at the international and national level. In this broader sense, the research outcomes might be beneficial to constituencies of the global North as well as global South because of the nature and coverage of IUCN and its role in conservation policy formation. This effort may serve as a model for additional research on international organizations.  Technical topics discussed in the book include: The Motivation for Environmental Conservation- How personal efforts make a differenceThe Role of International Environment Conservation OrganizationsThe Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theoryGovernance performance and Competitiveness Popularity indicesKnowledge creation and diffusionConservation commons

Opinion mining is determining people's opinions, about entities such as products, services and their attributes. Opinion feature identification from online reviews evaluated in two domain corpora, one is domain specific and other is domain independent corpus and this evaluation is based on number of occurrence of that feature. Domain relevance is used to measure distribution. By applying a set of syntactic rules identify candidate features in user reviews is primary task. Features extracted from this are specific to a domain. For each extracted candidate feature extrinsic domain relevance and intrinsic domain relevance value are calculated. Experimental result show that extracted opinion feature remains constant after specific threshold value. Precision value decreases according to the threshold value increases.

Revision with unchanged content. Supporting domain-specific functions and relieving users from the database details are two major challenges faced by many today's database applications, especially in life science research. The most commonly used workaround is the form-based query interface. However, it has severe limitations on expressive ability, extensibility, and flexibility. Unlike most of previous studies that adopted domain-specific query strategies, this book proposes a conceptual query methodology that can be generally applied in any domain. Meanwhile, it allows data-users to define their own domain-specific query functions. It is independent of database management systems and can be integrated into already-released systems as a complemental query function. This book will be of interest to biologists who are looking for a novel query methodology, to bio-database creators who are developing biological database applications, and to existing database system administrators who would like to provide a complemental query function for end-users.

This book details the conceptual foundations, design and implementation of the domain-specific language (DSL) development system DjDSL. DjDSL facilitates design-decision-making on and implementation of reusable DSL and DSL-product lines, and represents the state-of-the-art in language-based and composition-based DSL development. As such, it unites elements at the crossroads between software-language engineering, model-driven software engineering, and feature-oriented software engineering.  The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 (""DSL as Variable Software"") explains the notion of DSL as variable software in greater detail and introduces readers to the idea of software-product line engineering for DSL-based software systems. Chapter 2 (""Variability Support in DSL Development"") sheds light on a number of interrelated dimensions of DSL variability: variable development processes, variable design-decisions, and variability-implementation techniques for DSL. The three subsequent chapters are devoted to the key conceptual and technical contributions of DjDSL: Chapter 3 (""Variable Language Models"") explains how to design and implement the abstract syntax of a DSL in a variable manner. Chapter 4 (""Variable Context Conditions"") then provides the means to refine an abstract syntax (language model) by using composable context conditions (invariants). Next, Chapter 5 (""Variable Textual Syntaxes"") details solutions to implementing variable textual syntaxes for different types of DSL. In closing, Chapter 6 (""A Story of a DSL Family"") shows how to develop a mixed DSL in a step-by-step manner, demonstrating how the previously introduced techniques can be employed in an advanced example of developing a DSL family. The book is intended for readers interested in language-oriented as well as model-driven software development, including software-engineering researchers and advanced software developers alike. An understanding of software-engineering basics (architecture, design, implementation, testing) and software patterns is essential. Readers should especially be familiar with the basics of object-oriented modelling (UML, MOF, Ecore) and programming (e.g., Java).

This book covers several topics related to domain-specific language (DSL) engineering in general and how they can be handled by means of the JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS), an open source language workbench developed by JetBrains over the last 15 years. The book begins with an overview of the domain of language workbenches, which provides perspectives and motivations underpinning the creation of MPS. Moreover, technical details of the language underneath MPS together with the definition of the tool's main features are discussed. The remaining ten chapters are then organized in three parts, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the topic. Part I ""MPS in Industrial Applications"" deals with the challenges and inadequacies of general-purpose languages used in companies, as opposed to the reasons why DSLs are essential, together with their benefits and efficiency, and summarizes lessons learnt by using MPS. Part II about ""MPS in Research Projects"" covers the benefits of text-based languages, the design and development of gamification applications, and research fields with generally low expertise in language engineering. Eventually, Part III focuses on ""Teaching and Learning with MPS"" by discussing the organization of both commercial and academic courses on MPS. MPS is used to implement languages for real-world use. Its distinguishing feature is projectional editing, which supports practically unlimited language extension and composition possibilities as well as a flexible mix of a wide range of textual, tabular, mathematical and graphical notations. The number and diversity of the presented use-cases demonstrate the strength and malleability of the DSLs defined using MPS. The selected contributions represent the current state of the art and practice in using JetBrains MPS to implement languages for real-world applications.

The piecemeal fashion in which human factors research has been conducted in the maritime domain makes information retrieval available only by scanning through numerous research journals and conference papers. Bringing together human factors information from this and other domains, Human Factors in the Maritime Domain integrates a common body of knowledge into one single volume. The book provides the vital background information necessary to acquire a core knowledge base and a much-needed overview of human factors within the maritime domain. It starts by putting the topic into an historical and theoretical context, moves onto more specific and detailed topics and contemporary thinking in human factors, then reviews new maritime technology. The authors take a holistic approach based on a model of the socio-technical system of work in the maritime domain. They synthesize available knowledge and research, then present in an easily acceptable framework with example, illustrations, and case studies whenever possible, making the text rigorous, useful, and enjoyable. The three authors draw on a range of diverse backgrounds including working as a maritime surveyor, transport consultant, human factors lecturer, and mechanical engineer. They have undertaken maritime research in Denmark, Australia, Malta, and the UK. They have published several other human factor books on related topics. This combination of human factors knowledge, maritime wisdom, and substantial publication experience results in a book that is effective and practical.

This book addresses the nature of sound, focusing on the characteristics of sound waves in the context of time structures. This time domain approach provides an informative and intuitively understandable description of various acoustic topics such as sound waves travelling in an acoustic tube or in other media where spectral or modal analysis can be intensively performed. Starting from the introductory topic of sinusoidal waves, it discusses the formal relationship between the time and frequency domains, summarizing the fundamental notions of Fourier or z-transformations and linear systems theory, along with interesting examples from acoustical research.  The books novel approach is of interest to research engineers and scientists In particular, the expressions concerning waveforms including the impulse responses are important for audio engineers who are familiar with digital signal analysis. Every chapter includes simple exercises designed to be solved without the need for a computer. Thus they help reconfirm the fundamental ideas and notions present in every chapter. The book is self-contained and concise, and requires only basic knowledge of acoustics and signal processing, making it valuable as a textbook for graduate and undergraduate university courses.

This book presents an unconventional approach for implementing chipless radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems and related sensors. Contrary to most state-of-the-art chipless-RFID systems, the proposed approach is based on time domain and the tags are read through near field. The book discusses different aspects of these chipless-RFID systems, including tag and reader design, strategies to enhance the data density and capacity, tag programming and erasing, tag implementation in plastic and paper substrates, and synchronous tag reading, among others. A tolerance analysis and validation of the different systems, as well as prospective applications, are also included. The book also offers a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in chipless-RFID technology, including a comparative analysis, which is extended also to chip-based RFID systems. Readers are expected to be familiar with RF/microwave engineering technology. Besides master's and postgraduate students, the book is intended for researchers in the field of radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology, and may be of interest for engineers working in the areas of wireless communications, automatic identification, security, authentication, microwave and wireless sensors, as well as those dealing with internet of things (IoT) and smart systems.

These are the proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in Science and Engineering, which was held in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada in July 2018.  Domain decomposition methods are iterative methods for solving the often very large systems of equations that arise when engineering problems are discretized, frequently using finite elements or other modern techniques. These methods are specifically designed to make effective use of massively parallel, high-performance computing systems. The book presents both theoretical and computational advances in this domain, reflecting the state of art in 2018.

See how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) combines with Jakarta EE MicroProfile or Spring Boot to offer a complete suite for building enterprise-grade applications. In this book you will see how these all come together in one of the most efficient ways to develop complex software, with a particular focus on the DDD process. Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java starts by building out the Cargo Tracker reference application as a monolithic application using the Jakarta EE platform. By doing so, you will map concepts of DDD (bounded contexts, language, and aggregates) to the corresponding available tools (CDI, JAX-RS, and JPA) within the Jakarta EE platform. Once you have completed the monolithic application, you will walk through the complete conversion of the monolith to a microservices-based architecture, again mapping the concepts of DDD and the corresponding available tools within the MicroProfile platform (config, discovery, and fault tolerance). To finish this section, you will examine the same microservices architecture on the Spring Boot platform. The final set of chapters looks at what the application would be like if you used the CQRS and event sourcing patterns. Here you'll use the Axon framework as the base framework. What You Will LearnDiscover the DDD architectural principles and use the DDD design patternsUse the new Eclipse Jakarta EE platform Work with the Spring Boot frameworkImplement microservices design patterns, including context mapping, logic design, entities, integration, testing, and securityCarry out event sourcingApply CQRS Who This Book Is ForJunior developers intending to start working on enterprise Java; senior developers transitioning from monolithic- to microservices-based architectures; and architects transitioning to a DDD philosophy of building applications.
