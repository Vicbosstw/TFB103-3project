There are many books that detail tools and techniques of penetration testing, but none of these effectively communicate how the information gathered from tests should be analyzed and implemented. Until recently, there was very little strategic information available to explain the value of ethical hacking and how tests should be performed in order to provide a company with insight beyond a mere listing of security vulnerabilities. Now there is a resource that illustrates how an organization can gain as much value from an ethical hack as possible. The Ethical Hack: A Framework for Business Value Penetration Testing explains the methodologies, framework, and unwritten conventions that ethical hacks should employ to provide the maximum value to organizations that want to harden their security. This book is unique in that it goes beyond the technical aspects of penetration testing to address the processes and rules of engagement required for successful tests. It examines testing from a strategic perspective, shedding light on how testing ramifications affect an entire organization. Security practitioners can use this resource to reduce their exposure and deliver a focused, valuable service to customers. Organizations will learn how to align the information about tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities that they gathered from testing with their overall business objectives.

本書的主題是底層的程式開發技術。底層指的是接近「赤裸」的電腦硬體。 軟體的世界是藉著不斷堆疊「抽象化」而進步的。組合語言是機械語言的抽象化、C 語言是組合語言的抽象化。而在 C 語言之上，還有許多以 C 實作的各種 script 語言。抽象化可將底層的複雜部份隱藏起來，為開發者提供更具生產力、安全性更高的程式開發手段。 但是，也不能因為這樣就認為把底層的技術完全忘光也能開發程式。若想追求性能極限、盡可能提高可靠度、想解決偶爾發生的「神秘錯誤」，就不得不面對底層細節了。可惜的是，抽象化並非萬全的解決之道。 比如說，Ruby 與 Perl 寫的 script 若是發生 segmentation fault 異常結束的話，就需要下到 C 語言這層尋找原因。有時也會遇到特殊的問題，需要發揮「在執行的時候改寫程式自己的機械碼」這種棘手的技巧。如果不知道底層技術的話，就沒辦法面對這些問題了。 本書的目標，就是介紹這些場面之中能夠發揮威力的眾多訣竅，也就是「Binary Hacks」。Binary Hack 的名稱是來自 0 與 1，也就是程式開發時位於最底層的 binary 觀念。本書把 Binary Hacks 定義為「運用底層軟體技術的程式設計訣竅」，廣泛涵蓋了基本工具的使用方式、安全議題、以及運用 OS 與處理器功能等進階議題。 以往，這類訣竅都沒有整理起來，像是「知道的人就會知道」的東西。本書就是嘗試把這些訣竅集合起來，使它們成為誰都可以運用的工具。本書主要是收集在實際情形下幫得上忙的 hacks，但也提到不少沒什麼用、卻很有趣的 hacks。希望您能透過本書學到有用的訣竅、體會底層技術的趣味。

An inside tour of the incredible--and probably dangerous--plans to counteract the effects of climate change through experiments that range from the plausible to the fantasticDavid Battisti had arrived in Cambridge expecting a bloodbath. So had many of the other scientists who had joined him for an invitation-only workshop on climate science in 2007, with geoengineering at the top of the agenda. We can't take deliberately altering the atmosphere seriously, he thought, because there's no way we'll ever know enough to control it. But by the second day, with bad climate news piling on bad climate news, he was having second thoughts. When the scientists voted in a straw poll on whether to support geoengineering research, Battisti, filled with fear about the future, voted in favor.While the pernicious effects of global warming are clear, efforts to reduce the carbon emissions that cause it have fallen far short of what's needed. Some scientists have started exploring more direct and radical ways to cool the planet, such as: Pouring reflective pollution into the upper atmosphereMaking clouds brighterGrowing enormous blooms of algae in the oceanSchemes that were science fiction just a few years ago have become earnest plans being studied by alarmed scientists, determined to avoid a climate catastrophe. In Hack the Planet, Science magazine reporter Eli Kintisch looks more closely at this array of ideas and characters, asking if these risky schemes will work, and just how geoengineering is changing the world.Scientists are developing geoengineering techniques for worst-case scenarios. But what would those desperate times look like? Kintisch outlines four circumstances: collapsing ice sheets, megadroughts, a catastrophic methane release, and slowing of the global ocean conveyor belt.As incredible and outlandish as many of these plans may seem, could they soon become our only hope for avoiding calamity? Or will the plans of brilliant and well-intentioned scientists cause unforeseeable disasters as they play out in the real world? And does the advent of geoengineering mean that humanity has failed in its role as steward of the planet--or taken on a new responsibility? Kintisch lays out the possibilities and dangers of geoengineering in a time of planetary tipping points. His investigation is required reading as the debate over global warming shifts to whether humanity should Hack the Planet.
