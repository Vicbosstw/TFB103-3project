With Kubernetes, it is possible and easy for you to automate the deployment, management, and scaling of any containerized applications. You can use this container to group containers which make up a particular application into a number of logical units to make it easy for discovery and management. This container operates by use of the same technique which makes Google run many containers numbering in the billions on a weekly basis, and it can scale and you will not be required to increase the ops team. Kubernetes is a very flexible container, whether you are running it locally or on a global enterprise, and it will allow you to be able to deliver your container in an easier and more consistent manner despite how complex it might be. It is open source, and you are able to move your workloads to where you need. A large number of major companies appreciate the potential to save on costs when it comes to containers and Kubernetes. In particular, containers are more lightweight than VMs and can share a single OS, which causes a significant decrease in the costs of infrastructure. Their maintenance costs are also low. Additionally, they have faster CI/CD pipelines and allow your development and engineering teams better coordination with each other. Adding Kubernetes to the equation more benefits are gained. By autoscaling you can save more. The other benefits include efficient application scheduling, efficient cluster-level resource management, and rolling updates. - How Kubernetes operates- Deployment- Kubernetes pods- Kubernetes services- Kubernetes design patterns- Kubernetes cliene libraries and extensions- Logging- The intricacies of this management plane in Kubernetes- Cluster federation- Kubernetes ingress...And much moreOverall, you can expect to save your team's time and also make a two-digit saving all thanks to both containerized applications and container orchestration. Applications are deployed through containers focusing on operating-system-level virtualization as opposed to hardware virtualization. This enables us to put an end to the limitations of the host by selecting executable file-systems, libraries, and etc. With Kubernetes, connecting applications with appropriate services through configuring firewalls of the cloud service providers can be made at once. In complex configurations, it creates an external load-balancer and discovering cross-cluster service through the use of federated services.

Operators are a way of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications. A Kubernetes application doesn't just run on Kubernetes; it's composed and managed in Kubernetes terms. Operators add application-specific operational knowledge to a Kubernetes cluster, making it easier to automate complex, stateful applications and to augment the platform. Operators can coordinate application upgrades seamlessly, react to failures automatically, and streamline repetitive maintenance like backups.Think of Operators as site reliability engineers in software. They work by extending the Kubernetes control plane and API, helping systems integrators, cluster administrators, and application developers reliably deploy and manage key services and components. Using real-world examples, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood demonstrate how to use Operators today and how to create Operators for your applications with the Operator Framework and SDK.Learn how to establish a Kubernetes cluster and deploy an OperatorExamine a range of Operators from usage to implementationExplore the three pillars of the Operator Framework: the Operator SDK, the Operator Lifecycle Manager, and Operator MeteringBuild Operators from the ground up using the Operator SDKBuild, package, and run an Operator in development, testing, and production phasesLearn how to distribute your Operator for installation on Kubernetes clusters

ML is all about learning relationships from labeled (Supervised) or unlabeled data (Unsupervised). DL has many layers of learning and can extract patterns from unstructured data like images, video, audio, etc.? Keras to Kubernetes: The Journey of a Machine Learning Model to Production?takes you through real-world examples of building DL models in Keras for recognizing product logos in images and extracting sentiment from text. You will then take that trained model and package it as a web application container before learning how to deploy this model at scale on a Kubernetes cluster. You will understand the different practical steps involved in real-world ML implementations which go beyond the algorithms.  Find hands-on learning examples?  Learn to uses Keras and Kubernetes to deploy Machine Learning models  Discover new ways to collect and manage your image and text data with Machine Learning  Reuse examples as-is to deploy your models  Understand the ML model development lifecycle and deployment to production If youre ready to learn about one of the most popular DL frameworks and build production applications with it, youve come to the right place!

Legend has it that Google deploys over two billion application containers a week. How's that possible? Google revealed the secret through a project called Kubernetes, an open source cluster orchestrator (based on its internal Borg system) that radically simplifies the task of building, deploying, and maintaining scalable distributed systems in the cloud. This practical guide shows you how Kubernetes and container technology can help you achieve new levels of velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency.Authors Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, and Joe Beda--who've worked on Kubernetes at Google and other organizatons--explain how this system fits into the lifecycle of a distributed application. You will learn how to use tools and APIs to automate scalable distributed systems, whether it is for online services, machine-learning applications, or a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers.Explore the distributed system challenges that Kubernetes addressesDive into containerized application development, using containers such as DockerCreate and run containers on Kubernetes, using the docker image format and container runtimeExplore specialized objects essential for running applications in productionReliably roll out new software versions without downtime or errorsGet examples of how to develop and deploy real-world applications in Kubernetes
