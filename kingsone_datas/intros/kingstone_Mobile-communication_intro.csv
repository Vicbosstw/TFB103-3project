Revision with unchanged content. Future mobile communication systems have to provide high data rates for multimedia services. The radio spectrum is a natural and scarce resource and therefore spectral efficiency is the most essential factor for future systems. This work investigates the spectral efficiency of the next generation cellular system WINNER. The focus is on multihop relay enhanced cell deployments as well as multicast and broadcast transmission. To develop realistic deploy-ments, quality of service constraints from the user and deployment con-straints from the operator side are considered. The investigations are part of the European research project WINNER and results are presented in this context. The first part introduces the WINNER wide area deployment. Further, solutions for relay enhanced cell deployments and for multicast and broadcast transmission are developed. System-level simulations are used to evaluate the proposed deployments. Final results for both parts and combined solutions are presented. This book addresses engineers and researchers working in the field of wireless and mobile communications.
