還在MySQL嗎？
	全世界都在NoSQL了，首選當然就是Redis！
	好裝好用還能用Docker做叢集分佈，帶你進入巨量資料的世界。


	絕大多數Redis初學者只會拿Redis當Map用，只會在單機環境上只會針對String資料類型進行SET和GET操作，這當然不是Redis！Redis本身就支援多台叢集的功能，這才是NoSQL的精神所在。當系統出現大量存取需求時，單台Redis伺服器並沒有形成高可用的運行環境，這也是大家使用Redis最常見的錯誤。

	本書程式設計師提供一本實戰開發的Redis圖書，包括高頻使用的Redis運行維護知識、使用常用的Redis Java Client API框架Jedis來操作Redis伺服器的知識和技能。書中充實地介紹了常用Command命令的使用方法，介紹的命令的覆蓋率達到90%以上。當然最流行的Docker佈署方式也是Redis的最佳拍檔，本書也完全介紹。

A database is a collection of data that is saved and organized to allow easy retrieval when needed. It is the collection of schema, tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects. Databases are not limited to only computers, Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, the database itself to capture and analyze the data and provides facilities to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a ""database system"". Often the term ""database"" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database

Master a graph data modeling technique superior to traditional data modeling for both relational and NoSQL databases (graph, document, key-value, and column), leveraging cognitive psychology to improve big data designs. From Karen Lopez's Foreword: In this book, Thomas Frisendal raises important questions about the continued usefulness of traditional data modeling notations and approaches:   Are Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) relevant to analytical data requirements? Are ERDs relevant in the new world of Big Data? Are ERDs still the best way to work with business users to understand their needs? Are Logical and Physical Data Models too closely coupled? Are we correct in using the same notations for communicating with business users and developers? Should we refine our existing notations and tools to meet these new needs, or should we start again from a blank page? What new notations and approaches will we need? How will we use those to build enterprise database systems?  Frisendal takes us through the history of data modeling, enterprise data models and traditional modeling methods. He points out, quite contentiously, where he feels we have gone wrong and in a few places where we got it right. He then maps out the psychology of meaning and context, while identifying important issues about where data modeling may or may not fit in business modeling. The main subject of this work is a proposal for a new exploration-driven modeling approach and new modeling notations for business concept models, business solutions models, and physical data models with examples on how to leverage those for implementing into any target database or datastore. These new notations are based on a property graph approach to modeling data.  From the author's introduction:  This book proposes a new approach to data modeling--one that ""turns the inside out"". For well over thirty years, relational modeling and normalization was the name of the game. One can ask that if normalization was the answer, what was the problem? There is something upside-down in that approach, as we will see in this book. Data analysis (modeling) is much like exploration. Almost literally. The data modeler wanders around searching for structure and content. It requires perception and cognitive skills, supported by intuition (a psychological phenomenon), that together determine how well the landscape of business semantics is mapped. Mapping is what we do; we explore the unknowns, draw the maps and post the ""Here be Dragons"" warnings. Of course there are technical skills involved, and surprisingly, the most important ones come from psychology and visualization (again perception and cognition) rather than pure mathematical ability. Two compelling events make a paradigm shift in data modeling possible, and also necessary:   The advances in applied cognitive psychology address the needs for proper contextual framework and for better communication, also in data modeling, and The rapid intake of non-relational technologies (Big Data and NoSQL).

How do we design for data when traditional design techniques cannot extend to new database technologies? In this era of big data and the Internet of Things, it is essential that we have the tools we need to understand the data coming to us faster than ever before, and to design databases and data processing systems that can adapt easily to ever-changing data schemas and ever-changing business requirements. There must be no intellectual disconnect between data and the software that manages it. It must be possible to extract meaning and knowledge from data to drive artificial intelligence applications. Novel NoSQL data organization techniques must be used side-by-side with traditional SQL databases. Are existing data modeling techniques ready for all of this?The Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) is able to cover the full spectrum of analysis and design. A single COMN model can represent the objects and concepts in the problem space, logical data design, and concrete NoSQL and SQL document, key-value, columnar, and relational database implementations. COMN models enable an unprecedented level of traceability of requirements to implementation. COMN models can also represent the static structure of software and the predicates that represent the patterns of meaning in databases.This book will teach you:   the simple and familiar graphical notation of COMN with its three basic shapes and four line styles how to think about objects, concepts, types, and classes in the real world, using the ordinary meanings of English words that aren't tangled with confused techno-speak how to express logical data designs that are freer from implementation considerations than is possible in any other notation how to understand key-value, document, columnar, and table-oriented database designs in logical and physical terms how to use COMN to specify physical database implementations in any NoSQL or SQL database with the precision necessary for model-driven development  A quick reference guide to COMN is included in an appendix. The full notation reference is available at http: //www.tewdur.com/.

什麼是HBase？
 HBase是一種架構在Hadoop的資料庫。

  

 HBase是什麼？
 HBase是一種分散式資料庫。

  

 HBase不是什麼？
 HBase不是一種關聯式資料庫，不提供ACID的保證。

  

 HBase和NoSQL有什麼關係？
 HBase是NoSQL的一種，使用的是Key-Vaule技術，而且是極為著名的代表性產品。

  

 HBase在處理Big Data上，有什麼實證呢？
 Facebook使用的就是HBase，每天數百億筆的使用者之間的互動完全難不倒HBase。

 如果你只是想要了解什麼是HBase、HBase的用處、HBase的案例，那麼小編在上面講的已經足夠了，你不需要買這一本書，甚至不必去翻這本書。但如果你想要知道，為什麼Big Data不使用提供ACID的關聯式資料庫儲存，而適合用分散式的HBase資料庫，那麼本書會提供你詳細的答案。

 本書最適合的讀者是工程師，而非不懂技術的商業人士，如果你是資料庫工程師或程式設計師，那麼本書非常適合你。本書會帶你一步一步地實現下列實務上的需求：

 •[1] 如果你想要實際安裝HBase，想要建立HBase的表格，想要塞些資料進去表格中，
 •[2] 如果你想要寫程式來存取HBase的資料，本書會提供示範的程式碼並詳細講解(本書大多數的程式碼為Java，因為HBase是用Java寫成的)。
 •[3] 如果你想要寫個script來自動化操作HBase，本書也會教你怎麼做。
 •[4] 如果你是DBA，想要好好地設計HBase的schema，本書會利用一個實際的產品案例和一個需要特殊領域知識的GIS案例，教你學會從哪些關鍵之處來設計最符合系統需求的schema。
 •[5] 如果你是系統管理員，必須保證系統的流暢性與可用性，本書也會教你調校HBase的各項參數，並且排除故障問題。

 總之，本書是一本在操作HBase系統時、建置以HBase為資料庫的應用系統時，可以放在手邊的實戰參考書，能夠親手跟著做當然是最好的學習途徑。

 但除了實作之外，本書也會對於為何要這樣做，提出詳細的說明。甚至於本書還會說明如果這樣做會有什麼結果，如果那樣做會有什麼結果。

 之所以本書能夠在實務上提供那麼多的內容，完全是因為兩位作者本身就是HBase社群的佼佼者，而本書也請到了社群的主持人來幫忙做推薦序。

 在HBase的領域中，同時期在撰寫的還有一本定價較高的書《HBase: The Definitive Guide》，該書偏重在介紹內部機制。本書為了與之做出區隔，更關注於實戰的內容與範例。在這本書中，Amandeep和Nick使用了適當的、飽含實踐經驗的文字，淺顯易懂地告訴你該怎麼使用HBase。確實是Big Data時代，工程師手邊不可缺少的一本書籍。

Over the last several years there are two important trends that require additional thought when putting together an architecture for a hosted service. The ability to analyze and process enormous amounts of data is increasingly important.  From a technology perspective, the two trends to focus on are:  1. Batch processing -- the increasing awareness of batch processing and the recent uptick in use of the map educe paradigm for that purpose; Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems.  2. NoSQL stores - The rise of so called """"NoSQL"""" stores and their use to serve up data to online users; a distributed file system or network file system is any file system that allows access to files from multiple hosts sharing via a computer network. This makes it possible for multiple users on multiple machines to share files and storage resources.  Both of these trends represent significant advances in the way that hosted systems are developed. But in order to derive the most value for an entire system, developers must think about how these two areas will work together in some holistic manner.  This book is your ultimate resource for Storing and managing big data- NoSQL, Hadoop and more. Here you will find the most up-to-date information, analysis, background and everything you need to know.
