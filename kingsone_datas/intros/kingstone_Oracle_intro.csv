A groundbreaking history of the human mind told through our experience of dreams--from the earliest accounts to current scientific findings--and their essential role in the formation of who we are and the world we have made . . .  What is a dream? Why do we dream? How do our bodies and minds use them? These questions are the starting point for this unprecedented study of the role and significance of this phenomenon. An inves­tigation on a grand scale, it encompasses literature, anthropology, religion, and science, articulating the essential place dreams occupy in human culture and how they functioned as the catalyst that compelled us to transform our earthly habitat into a human world.  From the earliest cave paintings--where Sidarta Ribeiro locates a key to humankind's first dreams and how they contributed to our capacity to perceive past and future and our ability to conceive of the existence of souls and spirits--to today's cutting-edge scientific research, Ribeiro arrives at revolutionary conclusions about the role of dreams in human existence and evolution. He explores the advances that contempo­rary neuroscience, biochemistry, and psychology have made into the connections between sleep, dreams, and learning. He explains what dreams have taught us about the neural basis of memory and the transfor­mation of memory in recall. And he makes clear that the earliest insight into dreams as oracular has been elucidated by contemporary research.  Accessible, authoritative, and fascinating, The Oracle of Night gives us a wholly new way to under­stand this most basic of human experiences.

A radical retelling of our relationship with the cosmos, reinventing the history of astronomy as a new form of astrological calendar.Astronomy is another form of cinema. Time is fragmented and extended. Matter becomes light in motion. The camera remains fixed, looking outwards into the darkness, while the earth moves beneath our feet.A carefully constructed text in sixty numbered sections, The Space Oracle reinvents the history of astronomy as a new form of astrological calendar. This radical retelling of our relationship with the cosmos reaches back to places and times when astronomers were treated as artists or priests, to when popes took part in astral rites and the common people feared eclipses and comets as portents of disaster. Panoramic and encyclopedic in its scope, The Space Oracle brings astronauts and spies, engineers and soldiers, goddesses and satellites into alignment with speculative insights and everyday observations. The universe, Hollings argues, is a work in progress--enjoy it. Ken Hollings is a writer, broadcaster, and cultural theorist based in London. He has given readings, lectures and presentations of his work at the Royal Institution, the Berlin Akademie der K羹nste, the Venice Biennale, Tate Britain and the Royal College of Art, where he currently teaches.

Support for regular expressions in SQL and PL/SQL is one of the most exciting features of Oracle Database 10G. Oracle has long supported the ANSI-standard LIKE predicate for rudimentary pattern matching, but regular expressions take pattern matching to a new level. They provide a powerful way to select data that matches a pattern, as well as to manipulate, rearrange, and change that data.This concise pocket guide is part tutorial and part quick-reference. It's suitable for those who have never used regular expressions before, as well as those who have experience with Perl and other languages supporting regular expressions. The book describes Oracle Database 10G's support for regular expressions, including globalization support and differences between Perl's syntax and the POSIX syntax supported by Oracle 10G. It also provides a comprehensive reference, including examples, to all supported regular expression operators, functions, and error messages.O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers and database administrators everywhere. By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. Whether you're using regular expressions for the first time or applying your skills from other languages to the latest version of Oracle, the Oracle Regular Expressions Pocket Reference is the book to have close by.

There are so many computer books in the world. A few of them are lousy, most of them are pretty good, and several are excellent. Fortunately for the Gross National Products of nations, we all buy many of these books. Unfortunately, most of these books are never read, just skipped through and left to gather dust on the shelves with all the other good books (and course materials) that we never revisited. So many wise words, wise thoughts, funny and instructive stories, and so many years of experience collected in these books. And so many people willing to commit (!) the same mistakes over and over again because they never read the books, but instead perform the famous skip/skim procedure. Many authors ask for the skip/skim treatment of their books because, unlike Iggy, they either quote extensively from manuals or try to advise the reader about the chapters he or she can skip or skim. The few people who actually read a handful of good Oracle database books from cover to cover, including trying out stuff on their test system as they read--they will have a much easier and more entertaining work life with Oracle's database.

Application Express, or APEX, is one of the most innovative products to come out of Oracle in years. APEX is an application development framework for developing database-backed applications. It's easy enough to get started in that power users can quit storing data in random spreadsheets and instead centralize their data in the powerful Oracle database, all without developer help. Developers aren't left out, however. Those who choose to do so can go deep and leverage the full power and flexibility of Oracle's database engine.Getting started with APEX is easy; learning how to take full advantage of APEX is the problem. It was the problem, that is, until this book came along. In Pro Oracle Application Express, authors John Scott and Scott Spendolini open the ""hood"" of APEX and expose the full power behind its easy-to-use GUI. They show you what you need to know to produce powerful, professionally polished applications--such as user-authentication models, approaches to layout and navigation, how to integrate Ajax, how to deal with localization issues such as time zones and translations, how to customize the look and feel of an APEX web site, and much, much more.The authors are well-qualified to write on APEX. John Scott runs ShellPrompt, a hosting service that handles many large-scale APEX applications, some of which he is paid to develop. John is a hard-core APEX developer. His co-author, Scott Spendolini, is one of the original creators of APEX. Both John and Scott now base their full-time careers on developing APEX applications. Pro Oracle Application Express is your opportunity to learn APEX from the very best.

In this compact book, Steven Feuerstein, widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the Oracle PL/SQL language, distills his many years of programming, teaching, and writing about PL/SQL into a set of best practices-recommendations for developing successful applications. Covering the latest Oracle release, Oracle Database 11gR2, Feuerstein has rewritten this new edition in the style of his bestselling Oracle PL/SQL Programming. The text is organized in a problem/solution format, and chronicles the programming exploits of developers at a mythical company called My Flimsy Excuse, Inc., as they write code, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes-and each other. This book offers practical answers to some of the hardest questions faced by PL/SQL developers, including: What is the best way to write the SQL logic in my application code?How should I write my packages so they can be leveraged by my entire team of developers?How can I make sure that all my team's programs handle and record errors consistently? Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices summarizes PL/SQL best practices in nine major categories: overall PL/SQL application development; programming standards; program testing, tracing, and debugging; variables and data structures; control logic; error handling; the use of SQL in PL/SQL; building procedures, functions, packages, and triggers; and overall program performance. This book is a concise and entertaining guide that PL/SQL developers will turn to again and again as they seek out ways to write higher quality code and more successful applications. ""This book presents ideas that make the difference between a successful project and one that never gets off the ground. It goes beyond just listing a set of rules, and provides realistic scenarios that help the reader understand where the rules come from. This book should be required reading for any team of Oracle database professionals."" --Dwayne King, President, KRIDAN Consulting

It's sometimes said that the true job of an Oracle database administrator can be summed up in one, essential skill: to be able to recover your database.There's much wisdom in that statement.

Like it or not, the fearsome responsibility of protecting your organization's most critical data falls squarely upon your shoulders:   Lose that data and your company could fail.  Lose that data and you could be out of a job.  Scared? You should be. But there's help. You are not alone. Oracle experts Darl Kuhn, Sam Alapati, and Arup Nanda have come together in this book to show you the power of Recovery Manager, or RMAN, which is Oracle's backup and recovery tool of choice. RMAN Recipes for Oracle Database 11g helps you take advantage of all that RMAN has to offer by providing easy-to-understand solutions to business-critical backup and recovery operations. This handy guide:   Demystifies the steps required to protect your business data  Provides ready-made and step-by-step solutions to simple and complex backup, restore, and recovery operations  Is task-oriented, making it easy for you to find the solution to pressing backup and recovery problems  Respects your time by providing example-based solutions, not endless reading material  When the pressure's on, you don't have time for long discussions of theory. This book gets right to the point with quick and easy-to-read, step-by-step solutions that can help you backup and recover your data with confidence.

Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. "" I believe that observation to be entirely accurate. Someone else later observed that ""any technologist with sufficient knowledge is indistinguishable from a magician. "" With that in mind, what you have in your hands right now is a book on magic. However, for as long as I've known the author of this book, Jonathan Lewis (some 11 years according to my research on Google going back over the newsgroup archives), he has never been content to accept ""magic. "" He wants to know why something happens the way it does. So, fundamentally, his book is all about understanding: understand v. understood, (-std) understanding, understands 1. To perceive and comprehend the nature and significance of 2. To know thoroughly by close contact or long experience with More precisely, it is all about understanding the Oracle cost based optimizer (CBO), how it works, and why it does what it does. Jonathan conveys to us his understanding of the Oracle CBO through practice and example, and with this understanding, with this knowledge, new options and solutions become available. Put simply, the Oracle CBO is a mathematical model; you feed it inputs (queries, statistics), and it produces outputs (query plans). In order to use the CBO successfully, it is critical that you understand what these inputs are and how the CBO uses them.

The Oracle database is one of the most popular in the world, and for good reason. It's compatible, scalable, portable, and capable of performing incredibly fast.

And this level of detail, of course, can begin to weigh on database administrators (DBAs).  Fortunately, the Oracle DBA Pocket Guide from O'Reilly is on the case. This handy reference is designed to help administrators make more effective use of their time by presenting a compact summary of DBA tasks in an easy-to-use form. With this book by your side, you'll have instant access to the most important concepts, best practices, tips, and checklists.

Oracle is the most popular database management system in use today, and PL/SQL plays a pivotal role in current and projected Oracle products and applications. PL/SQL is a programming language providing procedural extensions to the SQL relational database language and to an ever-growing number of oracle development tools. originally a rather limited tool, PL/SQL became with Oracle7 a mature and effective language for developers. now, with the introduction of Oracle8, PL/SQL has taken the next step towards becoming a fully realized programming language providing sophisticated object-oriented capabilities. Steven Feuerstein'sOracle PL/SQL Programming is a comprehensive guide to building applications with PL/SQL. That book has become the bible for PL/SQL developers who have raved about its completeness, readability, and practicality.Built-in packages are collections of PL/SQL objects built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of these packages is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself. Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. for example: DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code.DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory.DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs.The first edition of Oracle PL/SQL Programming contained a chapter on Oracle's built-in packages. but there is much more to say about the basic PL/SQL packages than Feuerstein could fit in his first book. In addition, now that Oracle8 has been released, there are many new Oracle8 built-in packages not described in the PL/SQL book. There are also packages extensions for specific oracle environments such as distributed database. hence this book.Oracle Built-in Packages pulls together information about how to use the calling interface (API) to Oracle's Built-in Packages, and provides extensive examples on using the built-in packages effectively.The windows diskette included with the book contains the companion guide, an online tool developed by RevealNet, Inc., that provides point-and-click access to the many files of source code and online documentation developed by the authors.The table of contents follows: PrefacePart I: Overview1. IntroductionPart II: Application Development Packages Executing Dynamic SQL and PL/SQL  Intersession Communication  User Lock and Transaction Management  Oracle Advanced Queuing  Generating Output from PL/SQL Programs  Defining an Application Profile  Managing Large Objects  Datatype Packages  Miscellaneous PackagesPart III: Server Management PackagesManaging Session Information Managing Server Resources Job Scheduling in the DatabasePart IV: Distributed Database PackagesSnapshots Advanced Replication Conflict Resolution Deferred Transactions and Remote Procedure CallsAppendix.

The new Oracle Application Server offers a wide range of functionality, including Java runtime and development tools, portal development tools, business intelligence, single sign-on identify management, and much more. It's so powerful and complex, in fact, that many people who use the product (or are considering using it) are familiar with only a portion of the entire range of its capabilities. The choices can be overwhelming. Few people grasp how the larger issues--such as the interplay between components or the various architectural choices in the product--play out in the Oracle Application Server.This new guide provides the perfect introduction to the Oracle Application Server for users of any level. Regardless of which of the server's capabilities you use, you'll benefit from this tightly focused, all-in-one technical overview. It's written for anyone who is concerned with using and managing web servers, doing Java development and deployment, using Oracle's own tools--like Forms and Reports, using or developing for Oracle Portal, or those who use and administer business intelligence, mobile or integration software.Divided into three concise sections, the book covers server basics, core components, and server functionality. The book leads with the history of Oracle Application Server, its architecture, management, standards, and third-party support for languages and tools such as Java, Perl, and HTTP. The next section covers Oracle's web server, containers for Java web caching, and the server's security features. And finally, the book discusses HTML development, Java development, and Oracle development. Although the book refers mainly to Oracle Application Server 10g, the authors also describe features in earlier product releases where necessary, particularly Oracle9i Application Server.More comprehensible than a large reference and more detailed than a primer, the book provides a foundation for understanding and using Oracle Application Server effectively and efficiently. Readers concentrate on the most important issues and components of the server, focusing primarily on principles rather than syntax. Designed to be the ideal first OracleAS book, Oracle Application Server 10g Essentials offers Oracle application developers and administrators everything they need to know about this powerful server.

The vast majority of Oracle SQL books discuss some syntax, provide the barest rudiments of using Oracle SQL, and perhaps include a few simple examples. It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded Mastering Oracle SQL has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable.

It is a true honor to be asked to write an introduction to a book by Lex de Haan. I just hope I can give Lex the credit he deserves for his friendship, knowledge, enthusiasm, carpentry . . . and sheer energy in the many years we've been doing things in the Oracle world. Lex spent 14 years in Oracle, starting as an instructor in Oracle Netherlands, becoming initiator and coordinator of Oracle's excellent Technical Seminar business, and finally ending up in Oracle's Curriculum Development division as a manager for a bunch of very excellent course developers. He is never afraid to start up something new, to enter new and untried waters... a personal trait he shares with about 0. 00001% of the global population. Then, finally, Lex started up for himself, and, of course, the company name had to reflect his twisted, funny way of thinking: Natural Join. Who else can get away with it, looking sto- faced and with just the slightest twinkle in his eyes, if you look really carefully? Since then Lex, as always, hasn't looked back but has worked nonstop as instructor all over Europe and the Middle East, and as writer. The book in front of you is, in fact, an update of a book he wrote many moons ago, and which has served as a textbook in various Dutch schools.

Oracle designed its database products to be flexible and configurable so they would operate on a variety of hardware platforms, and they succeeded--Oracle software runs on more than seventy computer platforms, from mainframes to PC networks to handheld PDAs. The secret to this flexibility lies in the software's initialization parameters, whose numerous settings can be configured for top performance in countless environments. On the downside, however, improper settings can slow a system down; even grind it to a halt. And with so many parameters--which change from version to version of Oracle software--it's challenging for Oracle administrators to keep in mind the characteristics and optimal settings for each parameter. The Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference provides the crucial information you need to make key adjustments to your Oracle database. This concise guide is a mix of invaluable performance tips and a quick reference to Oracle's initialization parameters. The book describes each initialization parameter, indicates what category it's in--from auditing to multi-threaded server MTS--and whether it can be modified dynamically via the ALTER SESSION or ALTER SYSTEM command.  In addition to the details about parameter characteristics and settings, you'll find performance tips, such as how the various parameters interact, and what the most advantageous settings are for different configurations. No other reference focuses exclusively on these initialization parameters--an absolute must for anyone working with an Oracle database.  Presented in a handy, easy-to-use format, the Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference is a welcome alternative for anyone who's struggled to memorize the best configuration settings or gone back and forth to online resources, trying to figure out what works. O'Reilly's Pocket References put the information you need close at hand where you need it most. This guide will keep your Oracle databases operating at peak performance.

Net8 is the fundamental Oracle technology that allows Oracle services and clients to communicate with each other over a network. Net8 is most often used to connect client software to Oracle database servers. It may also be used to connect database servers to one another, allowing communication between distributed databases.This practical guide provides the information that readers, especially database administrators, need to know in order to install configure, tune, and troubleshoot Net8. It discusses how Oracle's network architecture, products, and name resolution methods work, and it provides the details of client and server configuration using a variety of Oracle protocols and networking products, including: The Oracle Internet Directory (OID), Oracle's implementation of the standard Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This directory can be used to maintain a central repository of net service names that can be referenced by all clients.Oracle Names, a networking component used mainly in earlier versions of Oracle, that allows net service names to be defined centrally.Multi-Threaded Server (MTS), an environment in which the client connections share access to a pool of shared server processes.Oracle Connection Manager, a Net8 component that acts much like a router and provides protocol conversion, connection concentration, and access control.The book also describes the utilities Oracle provides to help manage a Net8 environment; these include the Listener Control Utility (lsnrctl), the Oracle Names Control Utility (namesctl), the Oracle Connection Manager Control Utility (cmctl), tnsping, and Net8 Assistant. In addition, it provides a variety of networking troubleshooting techniques and commonly encountered Net8 configuration problems, and provides complete syntax for all networking files and commands.

Introduced a quarter-century ago, the Oracle database remains the leading enterprise relational database management system (RDBMS) in the world. Oracle is a complex system, offering a myriad of products, languages, and tools. Frequent updates, releases, and editions complicate the ability of Oracle users to keep up with the huge amounts of frequently changing information about the database and its capabilities.The goal of Oracle in a Nutshell is to pull together the most essential information on Oracle architecture, syntax, and user interfaces. The content and format of this book, an admirable addition to O'Reilly's respected In-a-Nutshell line, combine to boil down vital Oracle commands, language constructs, parameters, and file formats in a succinct and highly accessible desktop reference.Oracle in a Nutshell covers the information that database administrators PL/SQL and Java developers, and system, network, and security administrators need as they manage Oracle databases and write code for these databases. It includes: Oracle Foundations--Overview of the Oracle architecture (memory structures and fundamental concepts), Oracle's various editions and packaging options, summary of the initialization file parameters and data dictionary views, and fundamentals of Oracle's concurrency scheme, security mechanisms (privileges, profiles, roles), and networking files (TNSNAMES.ORA, SQLNET.ORA, LISTENER.ORA, DAP.ORA, NAMES.ORA, CMAN.ORA) and options.Oracle Languages--Syntax summary for SQL language statements, SQL function calls PL/SQL language statements and characteristics, PL/SQL built-in package headers, and Java (JDBC and SQLJ) interfaces to the Oracle database.Oracle Tools--Commands provided with SQLPlus, SQLLoader, Import and Export, Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) and other backup/recovery methods, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and various performance tuning tools (Explain Plan, TKPROF, AUTOTRACE, UTLBSTAT, UTLESTAT, Statspack).Appendixes--Summary of Oracle datatypes, operators, expressions, conditions, numeric and date formats, and resources for additional reading.

Why Read This Book? When you opened the cover of this book, you had a notion of what you would find. With a title like Beginning Oracle Programming, it's fairly obvious what this book is all about. Simply put, the purpose of this book is to teach you how to manage data using an Oracle database. The goal of Beginning Oracle Programming is to introduce you to those concepts that are important to understand as a beginning-level Oracle user. You are setting out on the same journey we traveled some years ago. We know the things you are going to run into time and time again. We understand the challenges you are going to meet when you have to develop an application or administer your database. We can guarantee you that the techniques you'll learn in this book are proven and have led us through many successful implementations. So instead of talking about the things we want to teach you in an abstract kind of way, let's talk specifics.

Oracle system performance inefficiencies often go undetected for months or even years--even under intense scrutiny--because traditional Oracle performance analysis methods and tools are fundamentally flawed. They're unreliable and inefficient.Oracle DBAs and developers are all too familiar with the outlay of time and resources, blown budgets, missed deadlines, and marginally effective performance fiddling that is commonplace with traditional methods of Oracle performance tuning. In this crucial book, Cary Millsap, former VP of Oracle's System Performance Group, clearly and concisely explains how to use Oracle's response time statistics to diagnose and repair performance problems. Cary also shows how ""queueing theory"" can be applied to response time statistics to predict the impact of upgrades and other system changes.Optimizing Oracle Performance eliminates the time-consuming, trial-and-error guesswork inherent in most conventional approaches to tuning. You can determine exactly where a system's performance problem is, and with equal importance, where it is not, in just a few minutes--even if the problem is several years old.Optimizing Oracle Performance cuts a path through the complexity of current tuning methods, and streamlines an approach that focuses on optimization techniques that any DBA can use quickly and successfully to make noticeable--even dramatic--improvements.For example, the one thing database users care most about is response time. Naturally, DBAs focus much of their time and effort towards improving response time. But it is entirely too easy to spend hundreds of hours to improve important system metrics such as hit ratios, average latencies, and wait times, only to find users are unable to perceive the difference. And an expensive hardware upgrade may not help either.It doesn't have to be that way. Technological advances have added impact, efficiency, measurability, predictive capacity, reliability, speed, and practicality to the science of Oracle performance optimization. Optimizing Oracle Performance shows you how to slash the frustration and expense associated with unraveling the true root cause of any type of performance problem, and reliably predict future performance.The price of this essential book will be paid back in hours saved the first time its methods are used.

Oracle Application Server 10g:  J2EE Deployment and Administration focuses on the latest version of Oracle's fully J2EE-certified application server (previously called Oracle9iAS). Oracle Corporation is aggressively attacking this market with a new lost-cost version of the server, as well as a program to move BEA customers onto Oracle free of charge. Adoption interest is growing rapidly amidst favorable reports regarding performance and reliability.Deploying and configuring J2EE applications are some of the trickiest processes in J2EE development, and they unfortunately receive scant attention in general J2EE texts. This book is a focused, no-frills guide to getting J2EE applications up and running on 10g. It covers Oracle's J2EE container, OC4J (available free of charge for development purposes), in full detail. It moves on to explain how to best configure and use the various enterprise-level features that come with the commercial editions. This is the book for anyone wanting to stay ahead in the world of Oracles application servers.

SQLLoader is a ubiquitous tool in the Oracle world. It has been shipped with Oracle since at least Version 6 and continues to be supported and enhanced with each new version of Oracle, including Oracle8 and Oracle8i. The job of SQLLoader is to load data from flat files into an Oracle database. It's optimized for loading large volumes of data, and is flexible enough to handle virtually any input format.Almost every Oracle user has to use SQLLoader at one time or another, and DBAs are frequently called upon to load data for the users in their organization. Despite SQLLoader's wide availability and usage, few DBAs and developers know how to get the most out of it. Oracle SQLLoader: The Definitive Guide has everything you need to know to put SQLLoader to its best use: an introduction to SQLLoader, a reference to all of its syntax options, and most importantly, step-by-step instructions for all the SQLLoader tasks you'd want to perform--and maybe some you didn't realize you COULD perform.You'll learn how to construct the necessary control files and load from different types of files containing different types of data (e.g., fixed-width data, delimited data, and data of various datatypes). You'll also learn how to validate data, load it selectively, transform it as it is loaded, and recover after failure. This book explains how to optimize SQLLoader performance by adjusting the transaction size and using the new direct path option. It also covers the newest SQLLoader features--the loading of large object (LOB) columns and the new object types (nested tables, varying arrays, and object tables).Oracle SQLLoader: The Definitive Guide is an indispensable resource for anyone who is new to SQLLoader; a task-oriented learning tool for those who are already using it; and a quick reference for every user. If you want to take best advantage of an essential Oracle tool, you need this book.

PL/SQL是個複雜又強大的程式設計語言，你可用來建立新一代的多階層系統－系統可放大到超越部門區域網路，以便讓Internet上遍及世界的企業系統，具有與舊的大型主機應用程式相同的可信賴度。具有建立那些系統的能力，並不代表能有效地管理開發環境。可以確定的是，能協助我們處理真正分散式企業物件複雜度的工具會晚點出現，但在這些工具實際準備好之前，我們早已身陷其中。 
Steven以直截了當的方式，讓所需撰寫和維護的程式碼數量減到最少；他的命名慣例可讓程式碼的註解內容增加到最大限度；他天生的才能可找出讓撰寫PL/SQL程式碼不會太沉悶、單調，並更具創造性的方式－這些特性對優秀的開發者應該會特別有幫助，且能激勵人心。 
Oracle8藉由增加語言的可能性和複雜性，把新的挑戰呈獻給PL/SQL程式設計師。這個新版本對原書的Oracle8部份進行更新，增加章節來說明新的PL/SQL物件特性（物件類型、集合、物件視觀表、以及外部程序）。第二版也包含調校PL/SQL極需的章節，以及對PL/SQL執行時進行追踪和除錯的擴充討論。

One of the most important challenges faced by Oracle database administrators and Oracle developers is the need to tune SQL statements so that they execute efficiently. Poorly tuned SQL statements are one of the leading causes of substandard database performance and poor response time. SQL statements that perform poorly result in frustration for users, and can even prevent a company from serving its customers in a timely manner.In this book, Mark Gurry shares his in-depth knowledge of Oracle's SQL statement optimizers. Mark's knowledge is the result of many hard-fought tuning battles during his many years of providing Oracle tuning services to clients. Mark provides insights into the workings of the rule-based optimizer that go well beyond what the rules tell you. Mark also provides solutions to many common problems that occur with both the rule-based and cost-based optimizers. In addition to the specific problem/solution scenarios for the optimizers, Mark provides a number of handy SQL tuning tips. He discusses the various optimizer hints, telling you when they can be used to good effect. Finally, Mark discusses the use of the DBMS_STATS package to manage database statistics, and the use of outlines to specify execution plans for SQL statements in third-party applications that you can't otherwise modify.

建議大家閱讀IEEE Software雜誌最近刊登David Garlan、Robert Allen及John Ockerbollm發表的Architectural Mismatch：Why Reuse Is so Hard (IEEE Software，第12冊編號6，1995年11月，第17至26頁)。本篇文章影響我對「再使用」軟體的觀念。「再使用」是軟體工程的聖杯，但是軟體界卻從沒有武士能尋獲此聖杯。文章中探討了原因何在，最主要的原因是設計者無法找到適合的可再使用的軟體。
追尋軟體「再使用」聖杯的觀念看起來似乎合理，但是我也相信軟體界大多數的人都不是高貴的武士，永遠尋找完美。我們大部份只想著把工作完成，盡力給顧客有價值的成品。軟體再使用的原則的確有道理，但以現實的角度來看卻不盡然。
特定的工具有特定的用途。舉例而言，你到規模大的五金行，你會發現許多不同款式的鋸子，不同的木頭要使用不同的鋸子，不同的切割方向也要使用不同的鋸子，不同的切割地點也要使用不同的鋸子(如鋸斷牆壁上的木頭需要特別的鋸子，因為你不可能把牆壁搬到桌上再用一般的鋸子切割)。你也要依據電源供應來選擇鋸子，也可能只是為了節省一些錢(如比較各家廠牌、國際廠牌或是偏好國貨)而選用不同的鋸子。再者，世界每天改變，新的建材、新的地點及新的賣商每天都增加，創造了更多的需求。您要有對工具、建材、場合及較大的現金流通有多年的經驗，才能針對不同的工作選用適當的鋸子。 
能幹的建造師不會死板地依照工具設計時的預期功能來使用工具。根據經驗，他們會視不同的場合巧妙地運用工具。「使用」工具與「設計」工具不同，使用工具需要一些知識及創意。但是巧妙地運用工具仍有基本的限制，任何運用都不可能超出設計的限制。 
如同鋸子一樣，Developer也是一種工具。經過12年多的發展，Developer已成為高效能、範圍廣的應用工具。就如同任何工具一般，Developer也有它的限制及缺點，它有預期的功能，但是使用者可以勇敢地設法突破這些預期的功能，以達到巧妙的運用。

The Unix for Oracle DBAs Pocket Reference puts within easy reach the commands that Oracle database administrators need most when operating in a Unix environment. If you are an Oracle DBA moving to Unix from another environment such as Windows NT or IBM Mainframe, you know that these commands are far different from those covered in most beginning Unix books. To jump start your learning process, Don Burleson has gathered together in this succinct book the Unix commands he most often uses when managing Oracle databases. You'll be able to reach into your pocket for the answer when you need to know how to:  Display all Unix components related to Oracle, identify the top CPU consumers on your server, and even kill processes when necessary Stack Unix commands into powerful scripts that can perform vital DBA functions Monitor Unix filesystems, and automatically manage your trace files, dump files, and archived redo log files Use essential server monitoring commands such as top, sar, and vmstat And there's much more between these covers. If you need to get up to speed with Oracle on Unix, and quickly, this book is for you.
