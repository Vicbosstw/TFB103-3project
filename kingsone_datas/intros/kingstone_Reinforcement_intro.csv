In the rubber industry, one of the most widely practiced processes is the reinforcement of rubber by particulate fillers, especially carbon black and silica. This process is of such importance that more than 99% of rubber products contain fillers, and the research and development of fillers have become the most widely researched area in rubber science and technology. This book covers the most important theoretical and practical aspects of rubber reinforcement, such as filler basic properties and their characterization methods, the effect of fillers in polymers, the processability of compounds, and the properties of filled vulcanizates. Special chapters deal with applications of fillers in tires and industrial rubber goods and the reinforcement of silicone rubbers. Testing methods and their principles, applications, and limitations are reviewed, with emphasis on the surface activity, widely accepted as the ""third dimension"" of filler characterization, after particle size and structure. This has not been described in depth in other books on rubber reinforcement. The effects of fillers on rubber and their mechanisms, which are important links between filler properties and the performance of rubber goods, are explained. A guide for selecting the most appropriate reinforcing systems for specific applications is provided, taking into account processabilities and properties of filled compounds and performance of rubber products. With solutions to many practical problems related to rubber research and compounding, this book serves as a valuable companion to engineers and product developers in the rubber industry, material scientists, and teachers and students in material science and rubber courses.

Learning to solve sequential decision-making tasks is difficult. Humans take years exploring the environment essentially in a random way until they are able to reason, solve difficult tasks, and collaborate with other humans towards a common goal. Artificial Intelligent agents are like humans in this aspect. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique to train autonomous agents through interactions with the environment. Unfortunately, the learning process has a high sample complexity to infer an effective actuation policy, especially when multiple agents are simultaneously actuating in the environment. However, previous knowledge can be leveraged to accelerate learning and enable solving harder tasks. In the same way humans build skills and reuse them by relating different tasks, RL agents might reuse knowledge from previously solved tasks and from the exchange of knowledge with other agents in the environment. In fact, virtually all of the most challenging tasks currently solved by RL rely on embedded knowledge reuse techniques, such as Imitation Learning, Learning from Demonstration, and Curriculum Learning. This book surveys the literature on knowledge reuse in multiagent RL. The authors define a unifying taxonomy of state-of-the-art solutions for reusing knowledge, providing a comprehensive discussion of recent progress in the area. In this book, readers will find a comprehensive discussion of the many ways in which knowledge can be reused in multiagent sequential decision-making tasks, as well as in which scenarios each of the approaches is more efficient. The authors also provide their view of the current low-hanging fruit developments of the area, as well as the still-open big questions that could result in breakthrough developments. Finally, the book provides resources to researchers who intend to join this area or leverage those techniques, including a list of conferences, journals, and implementation tools. This book will be useful for a wide audience; and will hopefully promote new dialogues across communities and novel developments in the area.

Revision with unchanged content. Can machines be taught? If so, what methods are useful for teaching machines? Machine learning is a field focused on systems that can learn through their own experiences and evaluation. Programmers could encode all behaviors for a task, but this process quickly becomes limited to condensed problems. Therefore, scientists have turned to methods with adaptability, ta-king cues from biological systems (including the human brain) to solve more complex problems in varied environments. This book describes two experi-ments implementing supervised reinforcement learning on a real, mobile ro-bot. One tests the robot's reliability in completing a navigation task it has been taught by a supervisor. The other, in which obstacles are placed along the path to the goal, measures the robot's robustness to changes in environ-ment. Experimental analysis answered: How quickly can the robot find the goal? How much reward does the robot amass? How often does the robot fail in the task? How closely does the robot match the supervisor's actions? This book is addressed to those looking for means to teach robots about rewards/punishments, such as researchers in Robotics, Machine Learning, and Engineering.

Revision with unchanged content. Reinforcement learning is an area of artificial intelligence that studies the ability of autonomous agents to improve their behavior in the absence of an informed instructor. Although reinforcement learning has achieved success in a wide range of applications, it becomes less consistent as the size of a task grows. This book attempts to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning in realistic tasks by identifying a certain type of task structure. A task that displays this type of structure can be decomposed into a hierarchy of subtasks. Each subtask can be simplified using state abstraction so that it is much easier to solve than the original task. Reinforcement learning can be applied to produce solutions to the subtasks, and the solutions can be combined to achieve a solution to the original task. Experimental results indicate that hierarchical decomposition combined with state abstraction can significantly simplify the solution of realistic tasks. The book thus contributes to increasing the potential of reinforcement learning in realistic tasks. The book is directed towards researchers in Artificial Intelligence, but can also be used as a reference by professionals in Robotics and Autonomous Control Engineering.

The idea is to replace existing pipes with a smaller steel pipe API grade wrapped with composite material used as reinforcement or coating the products existing in composite materials, minimizing the problems associated with the welding process, and corrosion resistance under stress. In terms of cost, the proposed pipeline will be more accessible to poor countries over the current product available there as well, processing of poor countries with relatively simple technology, providing them pipelines that are more resistant. The new product tested is more resistant to currently produced, which can be highlighted the excellent physical properties such as tenacity, elasticity, tensile strength and deformation, making them more flexible, even in adverse conditions.

This book explores the usage of Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Coordination. Chapter 1 introduces fundamentals of the multi-robot coordination. Chapter 2 offers two useful properties, which have been developed to speed-up the convergence of traditional multi-agent Q-learning (MAQL) algorithms in view of the team-goal exploration, where team-goal exploration refers to simultaneous exploration of individual goals. Chapter 3 proposes the novel consensus Q-learning (CoQL), which addresses the equilibrium selection problem. Chapter 4 introduces a new dimension in the literature of the traditional correlated Q-learning (CQL), in which correlated equilibrium (CE) is computed partly in the learning and the rest in the planning phases, thereby requiring CE computation once only. Chapter 5 proposes an alternative solution to the multi-agent planning problem using meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Chapter 6 provides the concluding remarks based on the principles and experimental results acquired in the previous chapters. Possible future directions of research are also examined briefly at the end of the chapter.
