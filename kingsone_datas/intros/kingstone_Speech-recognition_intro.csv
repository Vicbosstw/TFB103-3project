The activities in the field of automatic spoken language processing started after the Second World War with the works on the Vocoder and Voder at Bell Labs by Dudley and colleagues, and were made possible by the availability of electronic devices. Initial research work on basic recognition systems was carried out with very limited computing resources in the fifties of last century. The computer facilities that became available to researchers in the seventies made it possible to achieve initial progress within laboratories. Then microprocessors led to the early commercialization of the first voice recognition and speech synthesis systems at an affordable price. The steady progress in the speed of computers and in the storage capacity accompanied the scientific advances in the field. Although this book focuses on speech recognition but it also covers a brief introduction of the principles of speech production, followed by a broad overview of the methods for analyzing speech.

This textbook explains Deep Learning Architecture, with applications to various NLP Tasks, including Document Classification, Machine Translation, Language Modeling, and Speech Recognition. With the widespread adoption of deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and speech applications in many areas (including Finance, Healthcare, and Government) there is a growing need for one comprehensive resource that maps deep learning techniques to NLP and speech and provides insights into using the tools and libraries for real-world applications. Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition explains recent deep learning methods applicable to NLP and speech, provides state-of-the-art approaches, and offers real-world case studies with code to provide hands-on experience. Many books focus on deep learning theory or deep learning for NLP-specific tasks while others are cookbooks for tools and libraries, but the constant flux of new algorithms, tools, frameworks, and libraries in a rapidly evolving landscape means that there are few available texts that offer the material in this book. The book is organized into three parts, aligning to different groups of readers and their expertise. The three parts are:   Machine Learning, NLP, and Speech Introduction The first part has three chapters that introduce readers to the fields of NLP, speech recognition, deep learning and machine learning with basic theory and hands-on case studies using Python-based tools and libraries.  Deep Learning Basics The five chapters in the second part introduce deep learning and various topics that are crucial for speech and text processing, including word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and speech recognition basics. Theory, practical tips, state-of-the-art methods, experimentations and analysis in using the methods discussed in theory on real-world tasks.   Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Text and Speech The third part has five chapters that discuss the latest and cutting-edge research in the areas of deep learning that intersect with NLP and speech. Topics including attention mechanisms, memory augmented networks, transfer learning, multi-task learning, domain adaptation, reinforcement learning, and end-to-end deep learning for speech recognition are covered using case studies.
