This book provides a perspective on the application of machine learning-based methods in knowledge discovery from natural languages texts. By analysing various data sets, conclusions which are not normally evident, emerge and can be used for various purposes and applications. The book provides explanations of principles of time-proven machine learning algorithms applied in text mining together with step-by-step demonstrations of how to reveal the semantic contents in real-world datasets using the popular R-language with its implemented machine learning algorithms. The book is not only aimed at IT specialists, but is meant for a wider audience that needs to process big sets of text documents and has basic knowledge of the subject, e.g. e-mail service providers, online shoppers, librarians, etc.The book starts with an introduction to text-based natural language data processing and its goals and problems. It focuses on machine learning, presenting various algorithms with their use and possibilities, and reviews the positives and negatives. Beginning with the initial data pre-processing, a reader can follow the steps provided in the R-language including the subsuming of various available plug-ins into the resulting software tool. A big advantage is that R also contains many libraries implementing machine learning algorithms, so a reader can concentrate on the principal target without the need to implement the details of the algorithms her- or himself. To make sense of the results, the book also provides explanations of the algorithms, which supports the final evaluation and interpretation of the results. The examples are demonstrated using realworld data from commonly accessible Internet sources.

Revision with unchanged content. While many text mining projects emphasize retrieval and extraction, text mining can be leveraged to discover new and previously unknown infor-mation. Nowhere is the potential more apparent than in pharmacogenomics-based drug discovery. Text mining can help pharmaceutical researchers reduce the vast information overload hindering pharmacogenomics-based drug discovery because it can aid in the generation of rich novel information from large collections of diverse scientific literature and research data. However the pharmaceutical industry appears to be reluctant to innovate bleeding-edge text mining technologies for drug discovery. The present book re-frames text mining as an approach to automate the generation of novel and interesting information, reviews successful exemplary text mining appli-cations, and examines a case study of a leading pharma-ceutical company within the book's proposed novelty-generation paradigm. The present book is written for a wide range of professionals and scholars, not only for infor-mation scientists, industry analysts, and pharmaceutical executives, but also for those interested in innovation studies and the automated acceleration of discovery.

Bachelorarbeit aus dem Jahr 2019 im Fachbereich Informatik - Internet, neue Technologien, Note: 1,0, Hochschule Bremen, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Schwerpunkt der Ausarbeitung ist die Kategorisierung von E-Mail-Eing瓣ngen in einem CRM-System mit Hilfe von Text Mining Analyseverfahren. Dabei sollen gegebene Nachrichtenmuster stichprobenartig auf nat羹rlich sprachige Verarbeitungsmethoden und Klassifizierungsalgorithmen angewendet werden. Zudem sollen die angewendeten Klassifizierungsalgorithmen, anhand ihrer Genauigkeit bei steigender Anzahl ben繹tigter Trainingsdaten, gegen羹bergestellt werden. Auch die ?bereinstimmung zwischen erwarteten und ermittelten Kategorien sollen bei der Bewertung der Qualit瓣t, bezogen auf die Anwendbarkeit der Algorithmen f羹r die Problemstellung, betrachtet werden. Abschlie?end soll anhand von Nachrichten mit mehreren potenziellen Kategorien gepr羹ft werden, welche Algorithmen besser zur Anwendung verrauschter Daten geeignet sind. Als Analysewerkzeug soll ein entsprechender Prototyp implementiert werden, welcher den praktischen Teil dieser Ausarbeitung darstellt.

This open access book describes the results of natural language processing and machine learning methods applied to clinical text from electronic patient records. It is divided into twelve chapters. Chapters 1-4 discuss the history and background of the original paper-based patient records, their purpose, and how they are written and structured. These initial chapters do not require any technical or medical background knowledge. The remaining eight chapters are more technical in nature and describe various medical classifications and terminologies such as ICD diagnosis codes, SNOMED CT, MeSH, UMLS, and ATC. Chapters 5-10 cover basic tools for natural language processing and information retrieval, and how to apply them to clinical text. The difference between rule-based and machine learning-based methods, as well as between supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, are also explained. Next, ethical concerns regarding the use of sensitive patient records for research purposes are discussed, including methods for de-identifying electronic patient records and safely storing patient records. The book's closing chapters present a number of applications in clinical text mining and summarise the lessons learned from the previous chapters. The book provides a comprehensive overview of technical issues arising in clinical text mining, and offers a valuable guide for advanced students in health informatics, computational linguistics, and information retrieval, and for researchers entering these fields.

Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy, making it challenging for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling and visualization tools. With this practical book, you'll explore text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that authors Julia Silge and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind R packages like ggraph and dplyr. You'll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in R can make text analysis easier and more effective.The authors demonstrate how treating text as data frames enables you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics of text. You'll also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will help you generate real insights from literature, news, and social media.Learn how to apply the tidy text format to NLPUse sentiment analysis to mine the emotional content of textIdentify a document's most important terms with frequency measurementsExplore relationships and connections between words with the ggraph and widyr packagesConvert back and forth between R's tidy and non-tidy text formatsUse topic modeling to classify document collections into natural groupsExamine case studies that compare Twitter archives, dig into NASA metadata, and analyze thousands of Usenet messages
