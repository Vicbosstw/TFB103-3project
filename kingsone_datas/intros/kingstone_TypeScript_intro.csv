A detailed and easy-to-follow guide to learning design patterns and modern best practices for improving your TypeScript development skillsKey Features: Understand, analyze, and develop classical design patterns in TypeScriptExplore advanced design patterns taken from functional programming and reactive programmingDiscover useful techniques and gotchas when developing large-scale TypeScript applicationsBook Description: TypeScript is a superset language on top of JavaScript that introduces type safety and enhanced developer tooling. TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers.This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code.By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size.What You Will Learn: Understand the role of design patterns and their significanceExplore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScriptFind out how design patterns differ from design conceptsUnderstand how to put the principles of design patterns into practiceDiscover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programmingRecognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid themWho this book is for: If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.

◎清楚表達每個步驟或重點程式碼背後的意義

◎從無到有開發，只需一台電腦就能一同探索React生態圈

◎精選兩個實戰範例，不論是開發網站或發布元件到npm，皆一網打盡

	 

	本書內容改編自第11屆IT邦幫忙鐵人賽的ModernWeb組佳作網路系列文章《在React生態圈內打滾的一年feat.TypeScript》，有別於以往只告訴你用create-react-app快速建立React專案的教學，從最基本的Webpack、Babel配置開始，告訴你該如何依照需求建立適合自己的React專案，避免初學者陷入「知其然卻不知所以然」的情況。

	 

	除了基本的React專案之外，也介紹了如何為嘔心瀝血打造的元件撰寫單元測試，以及如何在React專案中導入TypeScript等技巧，讓你在開發上更無往不利。

	 

【四大重點】

	 

◎從頭開始了解React生態圈，明白工具為何存在

	本書的一大重點是「先釐清問題後解決」，因為不論是ReactRouter、Redux、單元測試或TypeScript，每個工具的出現都有它的意義。在使用這些工具之前，必須先清楚知道它們幫助了你什麼，才能解決正確的問題。

	 

◎從Reactv16入門，直接以最新的Hooks開發

	本書直接從Hooks學習React的元件開發，同時也考慮到React生態圈內其他套件對於Hooks的支援，除了展示套件的基本用法之外，也介紹了Hooks的寫法，讓你不會迷失在快速進化的前端技術之中。

	 

◎從「前端」角度介紹「單元測試」，替你的程式碼上道防護網

	「思考單元測試的意義以及測試的方法」是本書的精華內容之一，本書從原生的JavaScript到React元件，介紹了各種情境以及測試案例的寫法，不斷帶出「究竟什麼樣的測試案例才是有價值的」，讓「單元測試」這個技能不再像是謎一般的存在。

	 

◎介紹如何導入TypeScript並運用，提升前端開發的守備範圍

	近年來逐漸火熱的TypeScript，是由微軟所研發出來的新語言，本書將說明如何一步步將TypeScript導入至React專案，更重要的是釐清TypeScript可以在開發中發揮什麼幫助或解決什麼問題。

Any programmer working with a dynamically typed language will tell you how hard it is to scale to more lines of code and more engineers. That's why Facebook, Google, and Microsoft invented gradual static type layers for their dynamically typed JavaScript and Python code. This practical book shows you how one such type layer, TypeScript, is unique among them: it makes programming fun with its powerful static type system.If you're a programmer with intermediate JavaScript experience, author Boris Cherny will teach you how to master the TypeScript language. You'll understand how TypeScript can help you eliminate bugs in your code and enable you to scale your code across more engineers than you could before.In this book, you'll: Start with the basics:  Learn about TypeScript's different types and type operators, including what they're for and how they're usedExplore advanced topics:  Understand TypeScript's sophisticated type system, including how to safely handle errors and build asynchronous programsDive in hands-on:  Use TypeScript with your favorite frontend and backend frameworks, migrate your existing JavaScript project to TypeScript, and run your TypeScript application in production

Explore what React, Node, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that's where TypeScript comes in and why it's gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you've got a potent full development stack on which to build applications.You'll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren't just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You'll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own. What You'll Learn Get a project started and logically structure itConstruct a user interface with React and Material-UI Use WebSockets for real-time communication between client and serverBuild a REST API with Node and Express as another approach to client-server communicationPackage the app with Webpack for optimized deliveryTake a completed app and wrap it up with Docker for easy distributionReview a host of other ancillary topics including NPM, Semantic versioning, Babel, NoSQL, and more Who This Book Is For Web developers with basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and CLI tools who are interested in and in all aspects of application development, and using TypeScript instead of straight JavaScript.
