Get a novel perspective on Linux containers and understand the world of virtualization. This book takes you down the rabbit hole to discover what lies below the API. You'll go on a journey of virtualization and see how containers are realized in the Linux world. Linux Containers and Virtualization details the data structures within the Linux kernel which make up Linux containers.  You will start with the fundamentals of virtualization including how different resources such as memory, CPU, network, and storage are virtualized. Then you will move on to hypervisors and virtualization using the Kernel virtual Machine (KVM) and Quick Emulator (QEMU). Next, you will learn about Linux namespace, cgroups, and layered file systems, which are the essential building blocks of Linux containers. The explanation traverses the Linux kernel codebase to show how these are realized in the Linux kernel. In the final chapter, you will code your own container by applying the concepts learnt in the previous chapters.  On completion of the book, you will have the knowledge to start coding a Linux container.  What You Will Learn Understand the basics of virtualizationDiscover how the Linux kernel supports virtualization See how the evolution of the Linux kernel and CPUs led to the creation of containerization technologiesDevelop the ability to create your own container framework Who This Book Is For Developers working on virtualized software deployment and containers. Architects designing platforms based on a container runtime as well as DevOps professionals who want to get a microscopic view on how containers and virtualization work would find the book useful.

This book describes how the creation of new digital services--through vertical and horizontal integration of data coming from sensors on top of existing legacy systems--that has already had a major impact on industry is now extending to healthcare. The book describes the fourth industrial revolution (i.e. Health 4.0), which is based on virtualization and service aggregation. It shows how sensors, embedded systems, and cyber-physical systems are fundamentally changing the way industrial processes work, their business models, and how we consume, while also affecting the health and care domains. Chapters describe the technology behind the shift of point of care to point of need and away from hospitals and institutions; how care will be delivered virtually outside hospitals; that services will be tailored to individuals rather than being designed as statistical averages; that data analytics will be used to help patients to manage their chronic conditions with help of smart devices; and that pharmaceuticals will be interactive to help prevent adverse reactions. The topics presented will have an impact on a variety of healthcare stakeholders in a continuously global and hyper-connected world.- Presents explanations of emerging topics as they relate to e-health, such as Industry 4.0, Precision Medicine, Mobile Health, 5G, Big Data, and Cyber-physical systems;- Provides overviews of technologies in addition to possible application scenarios and market conditions; - Features comprehensive demographic and statistic coverage of Health 4.0 presented in a graphical manner.

Use this guide to one of SQL Server 2019's most impactful features--Big Data Clusters. You will learn about data virtualization and data lakes for this complete artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform within the SQL Server database engine. You will know how to use Big Data Clusters to combine large volumes of streaming data for analysis along with data stored in a traditional database. For example, you can stream large volumes of data from Apache Spark in real time while executing Transact-SQL queries to bring in relevant additional data from your corporate, SQL Server database. Filled with clear examples and use cases, this book provides everything necessary to get started working with Big Data Clusters in SQL Server 2019. You will learn about the architectural foundations that are made up from Kubernetes, Spark, HDFS, and SQL Server on Linux. You then are shown how to configure and deploy Big Data Clusters in on-premises environments or in the cloud. Next, you are taught about querying. You will learn to write queries in Transact-SQL--taking advantage of skills you have honed for years--and with those queries you will be able to examine and analyze data from a wide variety of sources such as Apache Spark. Through the theoretical foundation provided in this book and easy-to-follow example scripts and notebooks, you will be ready to use and unveil the full potential of SQL Server 2019: combining different types of data spread across widely disparate sources into a single view that is useful for business intelligence and machine learning analysis. What You Will LearnInstall, manage, and troubleshoot Big Data Clusters in cloud or on-premise environmentsAnalyze large volumes of data directly from SQL Server and/or Apache SparkManage data stored in HDFS from SQL Server as if it were relational dataImplement advanced analytics solutions through machine learning and AIExpose different data sources as a single logical source using data virtualizationWho This Book Is ForData engineers, data scientists, data architects, and database administrators who want to employ data virtualization and big data analytics in their environments
