The goal of this textbook is to provide enough background into the inner workings of the Internet to allow a novice to understand how the various protocols on the Internet work together to accomplish simple tasks, such as a search. By building an Internet with all the various services a person uses every day, one will gain an appreciation not only of the work that goes on unseen, but also of the choices made by designers to make life easier for the user.Each chapter consists of background information on a specific topic or Internet service, and where appropriate a final section on how to configure a Raspberry Pi to provide that service.While mainly meant as an undergraduate textbook for a course on networking or Internet protocols and services, it can also be used by anyone interested in the Internet as a step-by-step guide to building one's own Intranet, or as a reference guide as to how things work on the global Internet

A few years ago, communication in computer networks was considered the lot of young people, however, at the moment people of almost all ages use various computer networks to one degree or another, 90% of Internet users are also users of at least one social network. Of people over the age of 50, only 28% do not have a single account on social networks. In the modern world, the popularity of online publications is constantly growing. To some extent, this is associated with the development of technical means that ensure the transfer of information. Internet media compete with print media and television in the first place in the area of ​​prompt information. Journalists working for online publications are located all over the world. Paper carrier for humans is still an important part of life. At the same time, the most popular print media will undoubtedly develop online versions of their publications. Thus, the Internet editions will become not so much competing with print editions, as complementing the information provided. The manual is aimed at training modern journalists for new electronic media.

Since the development of Internet and the virtual world was meant to grow, they used for it IPv4 addresses and they knew they would be exhausted so they invented IPv6, all that just because the people responsible for that invention found out that there is an increasing need to grow and develop the internet and everything related to it not just because of the growing world population but also due to the invention of new devices that connect to the internet other than computers and network devices, with that came the need for larger scale networks and faster internet, but with the soaring internet speed these days, old networks are getting less able to deal with it, and here came the need to develop the network structure and infrastructure, everything related to this world is in advancement so why not the network itself . so, here comes the age of the Software Defined Networks, which means a potentially network depending on the software itself (programming and virtualization), so to make the networks faster they thought why not put the control in one device instead of multiple devices and strip the other devices from any authority or ability except for forwarding data.

Today's Computer networks have been the effect of progress from few decades ago. The invention of computer networks has its own history of evolution and started setting up their milestones day by day. The reason behind caring the communication is greatly evident, if no communication then world is filled of silence.The evolution of computer networks will offer you the deeper understanding of the greater achievements in this era. The computer networks weave their path to emerge from late 1960s. After the long way with the technological developments, in the mid-1990s, the growth of the Internet is enormous and written communication becomes vital in every individuals life. The influence of computer networks on other telecommunication network is known as ""network convergence"". Prior to digital evolution, the telephonic conversation is an analog mode of signal transmission. Digital voice transmission on the telephone network is one of the best and first signs to speak out the speciality of ""convergence"". The new services in computer networks are the prerogatives of telephone, radio and Television services.

	Leading networking authority Douglas Comer presents a wide-ranging, self-contained tour of the concepts, principles, and technologies that enable today’s Internet to support applications ranging from web browsing to telephony and multimedia. Comer begins by illuminating the applications and facilities offered by today’s Internet. Next, he systematically introduces the underlying network technologies and protocols that make them possible. With these concepts and technologies established, he introduces several of the most important contemporary issues faced by network implementers and managers, including quality of service, Internet telephony, multimedia, network security, and network management. Comer has carefully designed this book to support both top-down and bottom-up teaching approaches. Students need no background in operating systems, and no sophisticated math: Comer relies throughout on figures, drawings, examples, and analogies, not mathematical proofs.Appropriate for all introductory-to-intermediate courses in computer networking, the Internet, or Internet applications; students need no background in networking, operating systems, or advanced mathematics.

本書特色

	1. Broad Coverage of Key Concepts and Principles, Presented in a Technology-independent Fashion- Drawing on more than 30 years’ experience at the leading edge of networking research and implementation, Comer focuses on imparting knowledge that students will need regardless of which technologies emerge or become obsolete.- Every chapter includes hands-on exercises and projects that offer opportunities for students to test their knowledge and gain confidence in their abilities.

	2. Flexible Organization that Supports both Top-down and Bottom-up Teaching Approaches- The text is organized into five parts. Chapters may be sequenced in multiple orders to accommodate a wide variety of instructor/student/course needs and preferences.- This text combines the best of top-down and bottom-up approaches. When presented in order, the book exposes students to applications and allows them to write network programs early, while delivering all material in logical order so a reader understands how each new technology builds on lower layer technologies.

	3. An Accessible Presentation that Resonates with Students- No sophisticated mathematics is required—instead of formal mathematical proofs, Comer presents highly accessible examples, figures, drawings, and analogies.- The text answers the basic question: how do computer networks and Internets operate? It provides a comprehensive, self-contained tour through all of networking that describes applications, Internet protocols, network technologies, such as LANs and WANs, and low-level details, such as data transmission and wiring. It shows how protocols use the underlying hardware and how applications use the protocol stack to provide functionality for users.

	4. Keep Your Course Current- In response to suggestions from readers and recent changes in networking, the new edition has been completely revised and updated. The significant changes include:
	5. NEW! Updates throughout each chapter
	6. NEW! Additional figures to enhance explanations
	7. NEW! Integration of IPv4 and IPv6 in all chapters
	8. NEW! Improved coverage of MPLS and tunneling
