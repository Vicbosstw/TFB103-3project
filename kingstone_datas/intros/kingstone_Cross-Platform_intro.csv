If you have basic knowledge of C++ and want to build desktop or mobile applications with a modern graphical user interface (GUI), Qt is the right choice for you. Cross-Platform Development with Qt 6 and Modern C++ helps you understand why Qt is one of the favorite GUI frameworks adopted by industries worldwide, covering the essentials of programming GUI apps across a multitude of platforms using the standard C++17 and Qt 6 features.Starting with the fundamentals of the Qt framework, including the features offered by Qt Creator, this practical guide will show you how to create classic user interfaces using Qt Widgets and touch-friendly user interfaces using Qt Quick. As you advance, you'll explore the Qt Creator IDE for developing applications for multiple desktops as well as for embedded and mobile platforms. You will also learn advanced concepts about signals and slots. Finally, the book takes you through debugging and testing your app with Qt Creator IDE.By the end of this book, you'll be able to build cross-platform applications with a modern GUI along with the speed and power of native apps.What You Will Learn: Write cross-platform code using the Qt framework to create interactive applicationsBuild a desktop application using Qt WidgetsCreate a touch-friendly user interface with Qt QuickDevelop a mobile application using Qt and deploy it on different platformsGet to grips with Model/View programming with Qt Widgets and Qt QuickDiscover Qt's graphics framework and add animations to your user interfaceWrite test cases using the Qt Test framework and debug codeBuild a translation-aware applicationFollow best practices in Qt to write high-performance codeWho this book is for: This book is for application developers who want to use C++ and Qt to create modern, responsive applications that can be deployed to multiple operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux desktop platforms. Although no prior knowledge of Qt is expected, beginner-level knowledge of the C++ programming language and object-oriented programming system (OOPs) concepts will be helpful.

Understand how to use the Fyne toolkit to build exciting apps for a range of devices and deploy them effectivelyKey Features: Learn how to use standard widgets, dialogs, and layouts as well as how to build your ownUnderstand how to develop an app and package and distribute it to different operating systems and app storesExplore the design principles and vision of the Fyne toolkit and how that may align with your projectBook Description: The history of graphical application development is long and complicated, with various development challenges that persist to this day. The mix of technologies involved and the need to use different programming languages led to a very steep learning curve for developers looking to build applications across multiple platforms.In Building Cross-Platform GUI Applications with Fyne, you'll understand how the Go language, when paired with a modern graphical toolkit such as Fyne, can overcome these issues and make application development much easier. To provide an easy-to-use framework for cross-platform app development, the Fyne project offers many graphical concepts and design principles that are outlined throughout this book.By working through five example projects, you'll learn how to build apps effectively, focusing on each of the main areas, including the canvas, layouts, file handling, widgets, data binding, and themes. The book will also show you how the completed applications can then be run on your desktop computer, laptop, and smartphone. After completing these projects, you will discover how to prepare applications for release and distribute them to platform marketplaces and app stores.By the end of this book, you'll be able to create cross-platform graphical applications with visually appealing user interfaces and concise code.What You Will Learn: Become well-versed with the history of GUI development and how Fyne and the Golang programming language make it easierExplore how the Fyne toolkit is architected and the various modules are providedDiscover how Fyne apps can be tested and constructed using best practicesConstruct five complete applications and deploy them to your devicesCustomize the design of your apps by extending widgets and themesUnderstand the separation and presentation of data and how to test and build applications that present dynamic dataWho this book is for: ﻿This Fyne-Golang GUI book is for developers from any background who are looking to build cross-platform applications with a modern toolkit. It will also be useful for Go developers who are looking to explore graphical apps and GUI developers looking for a new toolkit for cross-platform development. Basic knowledge of Graphical User Interface (GUI) development is assumed (although a brief history is also included in the book). The book also features a short introduction to the Go language as a quick refresher.

Con l'avvento dei calcolatori e delle reti aziendali 癡 diventato semplice e veloce gestire le attivit? attraverso l'uso di DBMS (database management system). La possibilit? di valutare lo stato di un lavoro (attivit?) in ogni istante risulta fondamentale per una efficace gestione dei processi aziendali, inoltre il sopraggiungere dei dispositivi mobile sempre connessi a internet ha portato gli sviluppatori a realizzare applicativi che permettono di analizzare e valutare queste attivit?. In un primo momento la vasta gamma di dispositivi sul mercato e la differenza dei sistemi operativi adottati ne rendeva arduo lo sviluppo. Le Hybrid app (applicazioni sviluppate con un linguaggio terzo che viene poi compilato come applicazione nativa per i diversi sistemi operativi) hanno permesso di superare questa difficolt? portando notevoli vantaggi in quelli che sono: i tempi di sviluppo, la portabilit? e la manutenzione del codice. Sono queste le tematiche principali affrontate all'interno di questa pubblicazione, che hanno portato allo sviluppo e al rilascio di un applicativo mobile Cross-Platform per la gestione dei Ticket aziendali.
