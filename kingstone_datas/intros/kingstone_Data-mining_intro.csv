Graph data is powerful, thanks to its ability to model arbitrary relationship between objects and is encountered in a range of real-world applications in fields such as bioinformatics, traffic network, scientific collaboration, world wide web and social networks. Graph data mining is used to discover useful information and knowledge from graph data. The complications of nodes, links and the semi-structure form present challenges in terms of the computation tasks, e.g., node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. In this context, various advanced techniques, including graph embedding and graph neural networks, have recently been proposed to improve the performance of graph data mining.  This book provides a state-of-the-art review of graph data mining methods. It addresses a current hot topic - the security of graph data mining - and proposes a series of detection methods to identify adversarial samples in graph data. In addition, it introduces readers to graph augmentation and subgraph networks to further enhance the models, i.e., improve their accuracy and robustness. Lastly, the book describes the applications of these advanced techniques in various scenarios, such as traffic networks, social and technical networks, and blockchains.

Frequent pattern mining casts a vital part in many of significant data mining tasks such as associations, sequential patterns, partial periodicity, to name a few. Nevertheless, it is common knowledge that frequent pattern mining habitually produces an extreme number of frequent item sets and rules, paving the way for reducing in competence as well as efficiency of extraction in view of the fact that clients are best with the task of sieving through a huge number of extracted rules to locate the fruitful ones. Therefore, without resorting to the extraction of the frequent item sets, mining only closed frequent item sets goes a long way in incredibly enhancing the excellence along with the decrease in the computational time. This book focuses on a new mechanism for implementing the frequent pattern mining.

Data Mining Techniques comprise Tracking patterns, Classification, Association, Outlier detection, Clustering, Regression and Prediction. First step of Data mining is tracking patterns in which data mining is learning to recognize patterns in data sets. Classification is the second step in data mining which is a more complex data mining technique that forces users to collect various attributes. Association is related to tracking patterns, but is more specific to dependently linked variables. Outlier detection simply recognizing the overarching pattern can't give a clear understanding of the data set which is regarded as the third step in data mining. Next Step in data mining in Clustering is very similar to classification, but involves grouping chunks of data together based on their similarities. Regression, used primarily as a form of planning and modeling, is used to identify a certain variable, given the presence of other variables. Final step of the data mining technique is Prediction. It is one of the most valuable data mining techniques.

Doctoral Thesis / Dissertation from the year 2020 in the subject Computer Science - Commercial Information Technology, Symbiosis International University, language: English, abstract: Data mining is coined one of the steps while discovering insights from large amounts of data which may be stored in databases, data warehouses, or in other information repositories. Data mining is now playing a significant role in seeking a decision support to draw higher profits by the modern business world. Various researchers studied the benefits of data mining processes and its adoption by business organizations, but very few of them have discussed the success factors of decision support projects. The Research Hypothesis states the involvement of the decision tree while adopting accuracy of classification and while emphasizing the impact factor or importance of the attributes rather than the information gain. The concept of involvement of impact factor rather than just accuracy can be utilized in developing the new algorithm whose performance improves over the existing algorithms. We proposed a new algorithm which improves accuracy and contributing effectively in decision tree learning. We presented an algorithm that resolves the above stated problem of confliction of class. We have introduced the impact factor and classified impact factor to resolve the conflict situation. We have used data mining technique in facilitating the decision support with improved performance over its existing companion. We have also addressed the unique problem which have not been addressed before. Definitely, the fusion of data mining and decision support can contribute to problem-solving by enabling the vast hidden knowledge from data and knowledge received from experts. We have discussed a lot of work done in the field of decision support and hierarchical multi-attribute decision models. Ample amount of algorithms are available which are used to classify the data in datasets. Most algorithms use

Introduction of computers empowered us to attain new zenith in knowledge domain, developed pragmatic approach to solve life's problem and helped us to decipher different hidden patterns of data to get new ideas. Of late, computers are predominantly used in education. Its process has been changed from offline to online in view of enhancing the ease of learning. With the advent of information technology, e-learning has taken centre stage in educational domain. In e-learning context, developing adaptive e-learning system is buzzword among contemporary research scholars in the area of Educational Data Mining (EDM). Enabling personalized systems is meant for improvement in learning experience for learners as per their choices made or auto-detected needs. It helps in enhancing their performance in terms of knowledge, skills, aptitudes and preferences. It also enables speeding up the learning process qualitatively and quantitatively. These objectives are met only by the Personalized Adaptive E-learning Systems in this regard. Many noble frameworks were conceptualized, designed and developed to infer learning style preferences, and accordingly, learning materials were delivered adaptively to the learners. Designing frameworks help to measure learners' preferences minutely and provide adaptive learning materials to them in a way most appropriately.

Effective smart grid operation requires rapid decisions in a data-rich, but information-limited, environment. In this context, grid sensor data-streaming cannot provide the system operators with the necessary information to act on in the time frames necessary to minimize the impact of the disturbances. Even if there are fast models that can convert the data into information, the smart grid operator must deal with the challenge of not having a full understanding of the context of the information, and, therefore, the information content cannot be used with any high degree of confidence. To address this issue, data mining has been recognized as the most promising enabling technology for improving decision-making processes, providing the right information at the right moment to the right decision-maker. This Special Issue is focused on emerging methodologies for data mining in smart grids. In this area, it addresses many relevant topics, ranging from methods for uncertainty management, to advanced dispatching. This Special Issue not only focuses on methodological breakthroughs and roadmaps in implementing the methodology, but also presents the much-needed sharing of the best practices. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:  Fuzziness in smart grids computing  Emerging techniques for renewable energy forecasting  Robust and proactive solution of optimal smart grids operation  Fuzzy-based smart grids monitoring and control frameworks  Granular computing for uncertainty management in smart grids  Self-organizing and decentralized paradigms for information processing

Revision with unchanged content. In many predictive modeling tasks, one has a fixed set of observations from which a vast, or even infinite, set of potentially predictive features can be com-puted. Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be use-ful in a predictive model. Models which use the entire set of features will almost certainly overfit on future data sets. The book presents streamwise feature selection which interleaves the pro-cess of generating new features with that of feature testing. Streamwise fea-ture selection scales well to large feature sets. The book also describes how to use streamwise feature seleciton in multivariate regressions. It includes a review of traditional feature selecitions in a general frame-work based on information theory, and compares these methods with streamwise feature selection on various real and synthetic data sets. This book is intended to be used by researchers in machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery.

Information mining from speech signal as the ultimate goal of data mining is concerned with science, technology, and engineering of discovering patterns and extracting potentially useful or interesting information automatically or semi-automatically from speech data. With the advent of inexpensive storage space and faster processing over the past decade, data mining research has start to penetrate new grounds in areas of speech and audio processing. A typical speech can be broadly defined as speech with emotional content, speech affected by alcohol and drugs, speech from speakers with disabilities, and various kind of pathological speech. Individual speech can vary because of different timing and amplitude of the movement of speech articulation. Physical mechanism of speech undergoes changes, which can affect the nasal cavity resonance and mode of vibrations of the vocal cords. A series of environmental variables like background noise, reverberation and recording condition have also to be taken into account. In essence every speech production is unique and this uniqueness makes the automatic speech processing quite difficult.

This book explores the main concepts, algorithms, and techniques of Machine Learning and data mining for aerospace technology. Satellites are the 'eagle eyes' that allow us to view massive areas of the Earth simultaneously, and can gather more data, more quickly, than tools on the ground. Consequently, the development of intelligent health monitoring systems for artificial satellites - which can determine satellites' current status and predict their failure based on telemetry data - is one of the most important current issues in aerospace engineering.This book is divided into three parts, the first of which discusses central problems in the health monitoring of artificial satellites, including tensor-based anomaly detection for satellite telemetry data and machine learning in satellite monitoring, as well as the design, implementation, and validation of satellite simulators. The second part addresses telemetry data analytics and mining problems, while the last part focuses on security issues in telemetry data.

This book emphasizes recent advances in the creation of biometric identification systems for various applications in the field of human activity. The book displays the problems that arise in modern systems of biometric identification, as well as the level of development and prospects for the introduction of biometric technologies. The authors classify biometric technologies into two groups, distinguished according to the type of biometric characteristics used. The first group uses static biometric parameters: fingerprints, hand geometry, retina pattern, vein pattern on the finger, etc. The second group uses dynamic parameters for identification: the dynamics of the reproduction of a signature or a handwritten keyword, voice, gait, dynamics of work on the keyboard, etc. They discuss directions in the construction of information systems is the creation of automatic identification systems of the person, which are based on the analysis of these unique biometric characteristics. The book is intended for professionals working and conducting research in the field of intelligent information processing, information security, and robotics and in the field of real-time identification systems. The book contains examples and problems/solutions throughout.

Discover a variety of data-mining algorithms that are useful for selecting small sets of important features from among unwieldy masses of candidates, or extracting useful features from measured variables.  As a serious data miner you will often be faced with thousands of candidate features for your prediction or classification application, with most of the features being of little or no value. You'll know that many of these features may be useful only in combination with certain other features while being practically worthless alone or in combination with most others. Some features may have enormous predictive power, but only within a small, specialized area of the feature space. The problems that plague modern data miners are endless. This book helps you solve this problem by presenting modern feature selection techniques and the code to implement them. Some of these techniques are: Forward selection component analysis Local feature selection Linking features and a target with a hidden Markov model Improvements on traditional stepwise selection Nominal-to-ordinal conversion All algorithms are intuitively justified and supported by the relevant equations and explanatory material. The author also presents and explains complete, highly commented source code.  The example code is in C++ and CUDA C but Python or other code can be substituted; the algorithm is important, not the code that's used to write it.  What You Will Learn  Combine principal component analysis with forward and backward stepwise selection to identify a compact subset of a large collection of variables that captures the maximum possible variation within the entire set. Identify features that may have predictive power over only a small subset of the feature domain. Such features can be profitably used by modern predictive models but may be missed by other feature selection methods. Find an underlying hidden Markov model that controls the distributions of feature variables and the target simultaneously. The memory inherent in this method is especially valuable in high-noise applications such as prediction of financial markets. Improve traditional stepwise selection in three ways: examine a collection of 'best-so-far' feature sets; test candidate features for inclusion with cross validation to automatically and effectively limit model complexity; and at each step estimate the probability that our results so far could be just the product of random good luck. We also estimate the probability that the improvement obtained by adding a new variable could have been just good luck. Take a potentially valuable nominal variable (a category or class membership) that is unsuitable for input to a prediction model, and assign to each category a sensible numeric value that can be used as a model input.   Who This Book Is For  Intermediate to advanced data science programmers and analysts. C++ and CUDA C experience is highly recommended. However, this book can be used as a framework using other languages such as Python.

- This book is an updated version of a well-received book previously published in Chinese by Science Press of China (the first edition in 2006 and the second in 2013). It offers a systematic and practical overview of spatial data mining, which combines computer science and geo-spatial information science, allowing each field to profit from the knowledge and techniques of the other. To address the spatiotemporal specialties of spatial data, the authors introduce the key concepts and algorithms of the data field, cloud model, mining view, and Deren Li methods. The data field method captures the interactions between spatial objects by diffusing the data contribution from a universe of samples to a universe of population, thereby bridging the gap between the data model and the recognition model. The cloud model is a qualitative method that utilizes quantitative numerical characters to bridge the gap between pure data and linguistic concepts. The mining view method discriminates the different requirements by using scale, hierarchy, and granularity in order to uncover the anisotropy of spatial data mining. The Deren Li method performs data preprocessing to prepare it for further knowledge discovery by selecting a weight for iteration in order to clean the observed spatial data as much as possible. In addition to the essential algorithms and techniques, the book provides application examples of spatial data mining in geographic information science and remote sensing. The practical projects include spatiotemporal video data mining for protecting public security, serial image mining on nighttime lights for assessing the severity of the Syrian Crisis, and the applications in the government project 'the Belt and Road Initiatives'.

A successful integration of constraint programming and data mining has the potential to lead to a new ICT paradigm with far reaching implications. It could change the face of data mining and machine learning, as well as constraint programming technology. It would not only allow one to use data mining techniques in constraint programming to identify and update constraints and optimization criteria, but also to employ constraints and criteria in data mining and machine learning in order to discover models compatible with prior knowledge.  This book reports on some key results obtained on this integrated and cross- disciplinary approach within the European FP7 FET Open project no. 284715 on ""Inductive Constraint Programming"" and a number of associated workshops and Dagstuhl seminars. The book is structured in five parts: background; learning to model; learning to solve; constraint programming for data mining; and showcases.

The Definitive Volume on Cutting-Edge Exploratory Analysis of Massive Spatial and Spatiotemporal DatabasesSince the publication of the first edition of Geographic Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, new techniques for geographic data warehousing (GDW), spatial data mining, and geovisualization (GVis) have been developed. In addition, there has been a rise in the use of knowledge discovery techniques due to the increasing collection and storage of data on spatiotemporal processes and mobile objects. Incorporating these novel developments, this second edition reflects the current state of the art in the field.New to the Second Edition   Updated material on geographic knowledge discovery (GKD), GDW research, map cubes, spatial dependency, spatial clustering methods, clustering techniques for trajectory data, the INGENS 2.0 software, and GVis techniques New chapter on data quality issues in GKD New chapter that presents a tree-based partition querying methodology for medoid computation in large spatial databases New chapter that discusses the use of geographically weighted regression as an exploratory technique New chapter that gives an integrated approach to multivariate analysis and geovisualization Five new chapters on knowledge discovery from spatiotemporal and mobile objects databases Geographic data mining and knowledge discovery is a promising young discipline with many challenging research problems. This book shows that this area represents an important direction in the development of a new generation of spatial analysis tools for data-rich environments. Exploring various problems and possible solutions, it will motivate researchers to develop new methods and applications in this emerging field.
