Today's world is digital world. Nowadays, in every field there is enormous use of digital contents. Information handled on internet and multimedia network system is in digital form. The copying of digital content without quality loss is not so difficult. Due to this, there are more chances of copying of such digital information. So, there is great need of prohibiting such illegal copyright of digital media. Digital watermarking (DWM) is the powerful solution to this problem.

The digital image processing deals with developing a digital system that performs operations on a digital image.An image is nothing more than a two dimensional signal. It is defined by the mathematical function f(x, y) where x and y are the two co-ordinates horizontally and vertically and the amplitude of f at any pair of coordinate (x, y) is called the intensity or gray level of the image at that point.When x, y and the amplitude values of f are all finite discrete quantities, we call the image a digital image. The field of image digital image processing refers to the processing of digital image by means of a digital computer.A digital image is composed of a finite number of elements, each of which has a particular location and values of these elements are referred to as picture elements, image elements and pixels

The present work contributes to watermarking protection of digital image copyrights, and more specifically, the integrated methods of digital image watermarking (DIW) represented in recent Iranian publications. For each of the methods, the ultimate goal was to improve the attributes of digital watermark. Given that, several combined or novel watermark embedding techniques were proposed and applied in image blocks. For each of the proposed techniques, the model of watermark embedding and its parameters, as well as decompression and related flaws, the kind of possible attacks on watermarked images, etc. will be mentioned. When to copy electronic data, it is essential to maintain the copyright; therefore, there is not possible easily to do the forgery and manipulation of documents. The watermarking algorithms are proposed as solution for this problem. In this work, a review is represented about a number of proposed algorithms based on different aspects, and then a high yield algorithm is described named one-step Sudoku Table methodology that is more suitable for extracting the image.

Digital image correlation (DIC) has become the most popular full field measurement technique in experimental mechanics. It is a versatile and inexpensive measurement method that provides a large amount of experimental data. Because DIC takes advantage of a huge variety of image modalities, the technique allows covering a wide range of space and time scales. Stereo extends the scope of DIC to non-planar cases, which are more representative of industrial use cases. With the development of tomography, digital volume correlation now provides access to volumetric data, enabling the study of the inner behavior of materials and structures.However, the use of DIC data to quantitatively validate models or accurately identify a set of constitutive parameters remains challenging. One of the reasons lies in the compromises between measurement resolution and spatial resolution. Second, the question of the boundary conditions is still open. Another reason is that the measured displacements are not directly comparable with usual simulations. Finally, the use of full field data leads to new computational challenges.

This is an introductory to intermediate level text on the science of image processing, which employs the Matlab programming language to illustrate some of the elementary, key concepts in modern image processing and pattern recognition. The approach taken is essentially practical and the book offers a framework within which the concepts can be understood by a series of well chosen examples, exercises and computer experiments, drawing on specific examples from within science, medicine and engineering. Clearly divided into eleven distinct chapters, the book begins with a fast-start introduction to image processing to enhance the accessibility of later topics. Subsequent chapters offer increasingly advanced discussion of topics involving more challenging concepts, with the final chapter looking at the application of automated image classification (with Matlab examples) . Matlab is frequently used in the book as a tool for demonstrations, conducting experiments and for solving problems, as it is both ideally suited to this role and is widely available. Prior experience of Matlab is not required and those without access to Matlab can still benefit from the independent presentation of topics and numerous examples.  Features a companion website www.wiley.com/go/solomon/fundamentals containing a Matlab fast-start primer, further exercises, examples, instructor resources and accessibility to all files corresponding to the examples and exercises within the book itself. Includes numerous examples, graded exercises and computer experiments to support both students and instructors alike.

Since the advent of digital photography, we have been able to post-process our pictures. However, to do it properly, we have to become digital art apprentices. Sebastian Montabone is a computer vision expert who wants us to use our cameras and image processing software to come up with works of art. In this book, he teaches image processing techniques of ascending difficulty based on freely available tools. The book teaches you to use the best tools for the job, and it focuses on the techniques, not the environments or toolchains in which they run. Also in this book, you'll learn about the Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK), which expands the features of some cameras.
