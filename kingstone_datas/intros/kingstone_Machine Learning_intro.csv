A concise overview of machine learning--computer programs that learn from data--the basis of such applications as voice recognition and driverless cars. Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition--as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis for a new approach to artificial intelligence that aims to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise and accessible overview of the new AI. This expanded edition offers new material on such challenges facing machine learning as privacy, security, accountability, and bias. Alpaydin, author of a popular textbook on machine learning, explains that as Big Data has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning--the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge--has also advanced. He describes the evolution of the field, explains important learning algorithms, and presents example applications. He discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns to take actions to maximize reward. In a new chapter, he considers transparency, explainability, and fairness, and the ethical and legal implications of making decisions based on data.

This book proposes probabilistic machine learning models that represent the hardware properties of the device hosting them. These models can be used to evaluate the impact that a specific device configuration may have on resource consumption and performance of the machine learning task, with the overarching goal of balancing the two optimally.  The book first motivates extreme-edge computing in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Then, it briefly reviews the steps involved in the execution of a machine learning task and identifies the implications associated with implementing this type of workload in resource-constrained devices. The core of this book focuses on augmenting and exploiting the properties of Bayesian Networks and Probabilistic Circuits in order to endow them with hardware-awareness. The proposed models can encode the properties of various device sub-systems that are typically not considered by other resource-aware strategies, bringing about resource-saving opportunities that traditional approaches fail to uncover. The performance of the proposed models and strategies is empirically evaluated for several use cases. All of the considered examples show the potential of attaining significant resource-saving opportunities with minimal accuracy losses at application time. Overall, this book constitutes a novel approach to hardware-algorithm co-optimization that further bridges the fields of Machine Learning and Electrical Engineering.

This book explains the comparison of Statistical Technique and Machine Learning Technique, specifically the Regression Model and the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) Model. This explanation involves the Mathematical theory and principle upon which RBFNN model was developed and it manages the generally belief that Machine Learning techniques are ""Black Box"" meaning that the Mathematics of Neural Network cannot be explained. Therefore, this book explains the Mathematics of the Radial Basis Functions which depends on the Gaussian function. Some estimates of the two models were compared and explained in this book such as the Sum of Squares of Errors, Bayesian Information Criterion and the Relative Importance of each explanatory variable.

Do you want to understand machine learning? How it works and how is correlated to artificial intelligence and deep learning? If yes, then keep reading...Machine Learning is based on mathematics, specifically statistics. It is a probabilistic discipline that began in the 1950s. Despite initial enthusiasm, research and development in Machine Learning languished for over 30 years, suffering from twin ills of a lack of data to work with and computers that were too slow to effectively work with what data they had.It is no accident Machine Learning is coming into its own over the last 10 years. Until we began creating and storing massive amounts of data about our world, ML was mostly an idea in the minds of statisticians. And until computers reached a level of speed and power where these massive data sets could be ingested in a reasonable amount of time, the revolution couldn't happen. But as we digitize information about our world and ourselves, and computers continue to increase in speed and capacity exponentially, the ability for Machine Learning to learn from our data grows in depth and accuracy. Looking to the future, we can see only more and more data collection about our world, faster computer chips, and data transfer, and more avenues for ML to develop in, to grow and learn, and to serve humanity.When most people think of machine learning, they either have no idea what it is, or they automatically think about artificial intelligence in the form of a robotic species that rivals humans. While these fascinating subspecies may one day exist as the result of machine learning developments, right now the primary focus is on how machine learning programs can become excellent at very specific tasks. Most machine learning technology is developed in such a way that it is excellent at performing one or, at most, two tasks. By focusing entire technology on one single task, they can ensure that it runs that task perfectly, and that it does not get confused between the tasks that it is trying to accomplish. While simple computing software like the one that runs your computer can easily run multiple programs at once with little chance of crashing, the technology that is used to run machine learning technology is far more complex. As researchers study it, they strive to keep the algorithms mostly separate, or specifically focused on completing just one goal, on minimizing room for error.It is likely that as we become more familiar with machine learning technology and more educated in the algorithms, we will start to see more and more machines completing multiple tasks, rather than just one. At this point, that is the long-term goal for many scientists who want to see these machines becoming more efficient, and requiring less hardware. After all, the hardware used to run some of these machines is not always the greenest technology, so the fewer hardware casings that technology needs to be stored in, the less of a footprint the technology sector will have on the planet.

Do you want to learn how ML and AI can be applied in practice and be compatible with human behavior in modern times? If yes, this book is for you!Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven approach. Hence it implies the availability of large datasets in order to make accurate decisions. In case only a limited dataset is available to solve a particular problem, it is best to use a deterministic approach. When a limited dataset is available it is hard to train a machine learning model and generalize its applicability to other similar problems. The developed model, in this case, is only applicable for the few data it was trained on.Because ML methods rely solely only on data and the human expertise or judgment is not taken in consideration, it is the data that dictate if the machine learning method will fail or succeed to perform the task it was designed for. The way a machine learning approach works is that a modeler develops a learning algorithm. Then the modeler feeds the learning algorithm with the data and information.Could Turning Important Decisions over to AI help Humanity? Some might say that's a terrible idea, but how much worse is it today where we've turned over our societies and civilizations to corrupt leadership, crony capitalism, or had to deal with rogue nation-states in other parts of the world with two-bit dictators, religious fanaticism, or the quest to destroy another group of peoples' civilization? Perhaps it's time we came up with a special think tank that could go through all the issues concerning our fears, and what we hope to expect from AI decision-making machines. That is to say how to get the best possible answer, all the time with the greatest probability.We all watched IBM's ""Watson"" supercomputer as it won against the top human Jeopardy players. It did pretty well, most all the time; didn't it? Yes, but it wasn't perfect, and perhaps that's the scary part.

**55% OFF FOR BOOKSTORES!! NOW AT $ 20.95 INSTEAD OF $ 30.95 **Do you want to learn how ML and AI can be applied in practice and be compatible with human behavior in modern times? If yes, this book is for you!Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven approach. Hence it implies the availability of large datasets in order to make accurate decisions. In case only a limited dataset is available to solve a particular problem, it is best to use a deterministic approach. When a limited dataset is available it is hard to train a machine learning model and generalize its applicability to other similar problems. The developed model, in this case, is only applicable for the few data it was trained on.Because ML methods rely solely only on data and the human expertise or judgment is not taken in consideration, it is the data that dictate if the machine learning method will fail or succeed to perform the task it was designed for. The way a machine learning approach works is that a modeler develops a learning algorithm. Then the modeler feeds the learning algorithm with the data and information.Could Turning Important Decisions over to AI help Humanity? Some might say that's a terrible idea, but how much worse is it today where we've turned over our societies and civilizations to corrupt leadership, crony capitalism, or had to deal with rogue nation-states in other parts of the world with two-bit dictators, religious fanaticism, or the quest to destroy another group of peoples' civilization? Perhaps it's time we came up with a special think tank that could go through all the issues concerning our fears, and what we hope to expect from AI decision-making machines. That is to say how to get the best possible answer, all the time with the greatest probability.We all watched IBM's ""Watson"" supercomputer as it won against the top human Jeopardy players. It did pretty well, most all the time; didn't it? Yes, but it wasn't perfect, and perhaps that's the scary part. In fact, some of the mistakes that it did make were mistakes that even a child wouldn't have missed. Still, if there is a group of humans or a think tank, focus group, or Board of Directors constantly surveying the answers and asking additional questions, then perhaps you don't have to worry about an erroneous answer now and again. In fact, it might make you smile and feel good to be a human at that point.ML is useful anywhere you need to recognize patterns and predict behavior based on historical data.

Do you want to understand machine learning? How it works and how is correlated to artificial intelligence and deep learning? If yes, then keep reading...Machine Learning is based on mathematics, specifically statistics. It is a probabilistic discipline that began in the 1950s. Despite initial enthusiasm, research and development in Machine Learning languished for over 30 years, suffering from twin ills of a lack of data to work with and computers that were too slow to effectively work with what data they had.It is no accident Machine Learning is coming into its own over the last 10 years. Until we began creating and storing massive amounts of data about our world, ML was mostly an idea in the minds of statisticians. And until computers reached a level of speed and power where these massive data sets could be ingested in a reasonable amount of time, the revolution couldn't happen. But as we digitize information about our world and ourselves, and computers continue to increase in speed and capacity exponentially, the ability for Machine Learning to learn from our data grows in depth and accuracy. Looking to the future, we can see only more and more data collection about our world, faster computer chips, and data transfer, and more avenues for ML to develop in, to grow and learn, and to serve humanity.When most people think of machine learning, they either have no idea what it is, or they automatically think about artificial intelligence in the form of a robotic species that rivals humans. While these fascinating subspecies may one day exist as the result of machine learning developments, right now the primary focus is on how machine learning programs can become excellent at very specific tasks. Most machine learning technology is developed in such a way that it is excellent at performing one or, at most, two tasks. By focusing entire technology on one single task, they can ensure that it runs that task perfectly, and that it does not get confused between the tasks that it is trying to accomplish. While simple computing software like the one that runs your computer can easily run multiple programs at once with little chance of crashing, the technology that is used to run machine learning technology is far more complex. As researchers study it, they strive to keep the algorithms mostly separate, or specifically focused on completing just one goal, on minimizing room for error.It is likely that as we become more familiar with machine learning technology and more educated in the algorithms, we will start to see more and more machines completing multiple tasks, rather than just one. At this point, that is the long-term goal for many scientists who want to see these machines becoming more efficient, and requiring less hardware. After all, the hardware used to run some of these machines is not always the greenest technology, so the fewer hardware casings that technology needs to be stored in, the less of a footprint the technology sector will have on the planet. This book aims to educate you on the truth about machine learning.This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: What is Machine Learning?Machine Learning CategoriesSectors and Industries that use Machine LearningFundamental AlgorithmsRegression AnalysisBenefits of Machine LearningDeep LearningDeep Neural NetworkBig Data AnalyticsBig Data Analysis ToolsHow Companies Use Big DataData Mining and Applications...

This textbook introduces linear algebra and optimization in the context of machine learning. Examples and exercises are provided throughout the book. A solution manual for the exercises at the end of each chapter is available to teaching instructors. This textbook targets graduate level students and professors in computer science, mathematics and data science. Advanced undergraduate students can also use this textbook. The chapters for this textbook are organized as follows: 1. Linear algebra and its applications: The chapters focus on the basics of linear algebra together with their common applications to singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, similarity matrices (kernel methods), and graph analysis. Numerous machine learning applications have been used as examples, such as spectral clustering, kernel-based classification, and outlier detection. The tight integration of linear algebra methods with examples from machine learning differentiates this book from generic volumes on linear algebra. The focus is clearly on the most relevant aspects of linear algebra for machine learning and to teach readers how to apply these concepts.2. Optimization and its applications: Much of machine learning is posed as an optimization problem in which we try to maximize the accuracy of regression and classification models. The ""parent problem"" of optimization-centric machine learning is least-squares regression. Interestingly, this problem arises in both linear algebra and optimization, and is one of the key connecting problems of the two fields. Least-squares regression is also the starting point for support vector machines, logistic regression, and recommender systems. Furthermore, the methods for dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization also require the development of optimization methods. A general view of optimization in computational graphs is discussed together with its applications to back propagation in neural networks. A frequent challenge faced by beginners in machine learning is the extensive background required in linear algebra and optimization. One problem is that the existing linear algebra and optimization courses are not specific to machine learning; therefore, one would typically have to complete more course material than is necessary to pick up machine learning. Furthermore, certain types of ideas and tricks from optimization and linear algebra recur more frequently in machine learning than other application-centric settings. Therefore, there is significant value in developing a view of linear algebra and optimization that is better suited to the specific perspective of machine learning.

Road maintenance has traditionally been a time consuming, expensive, and manual process. Timely maintenance of roads helps in lowering rehabilitation costs, accidents, environmental pollution, while facilitating increased connectivity, trade, and growth. Easily acquirable front-view scene images are seen to be used lately for infrastructure management and road maintenance as they provide quicker, low-cost, and flexible solutions. Such scene images can easily be acquired using standard commodity cameras. In this dissertation, machine learning based approaches have been developed to analyze front-view scene images for detecting cracks automatically on road surfaces across different locations and under various conditions. This work thus contributes toward automated approaches to detect different kinds of cracks on road surfaces, thereby proposing a low-cost solution to road maintenance practices. As a result, different components are developed in this work which are sketched together to form a Decision Support System for the task of crack detection. In this study primarily three algorithmic approaches have been developed. Firstly, an unsupervised graph-based hierarchical clustering technique for road area segmentation has been developed, thus helping in detecting the road area in scene images. Secondly, a classifier and superpixel based supervised learning approach consisting of systematically identifying relevant features for detecting superpixels containing cracks has been developed. Thirdly, an unsupervised learning approach consisting of Gamma Mixture Fuzzy Model based clustering technique and keypoint matching mechanisms have been designed in this work for detecting which road pixels are crack pixels in images. Finally, this study integrates the findings and approaches to propose a Decision Support System for crack detection on road surfaces of easily acquirable front-view scene images. Evaluations performed on an experimentally collected diverse front-view scene

**55% OFF FOR BOOKSTORES!! NOW AT $ 20.95 INSTEAD OF $ 30.95 **Do you want to learn how ML and AI can be applied in practice and be compatible with human behavior in modern times? If yes, this book is for you!Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven approach. Hence it implies the availability of large datasets in order to make accurate decisions. In case only a limited dataset is available to solve a particular problem, it is best to use a deterministic approach. When a limited dataset is available it is hard to train a machine learning model and generalize its applicability to other similar problems. The developed model, in this case, is only applicable for the few data it was trained on.Because ML methods rely solely only on data and the human expertise or judgment is not taken in consideration, it is the data that dictate if the machine learning method will fail or succeed to perform the task it was designed for. The way a machine learning approach works is that a modeler develops a learning algorithm. Then the modeler feeds the learning algorithm with the data and information.Could Turning Important Decisions over to AI help Humanity? Some might say that's a terrible idea, but how much worse is it today where we've turned over our societies and civilizations to corrupt leadership, crony capitalism, or had to deal with rogue nation-states in other parts of the world with two-bit dictators, religious fanaticism, or the quest to destroy another group of peoples' civilization? Perhaps it's time we came up with a special think tank that could go through all the issues concerning our fears, and what we hope to expect from AI decision-making machines. That is to say how to get the best possible answer, all the time with the greatest probability.We all watched IBM's ""Watson"" supercomputer as it won against the top human Jeopardy players. It did pretty well, most all the time; didn't it? Yes, but it wasn't perfect, and perhaps that's the scary part. In fact, some of the mistakes that it did make were mistakes that even a child wouldn't have missed. Still, if there is a group of humans or a think tank, focus group, or Board of Directors constantly surveying the answers and asking additional questions, then perhaps you don't have to worry about an erroneous answer now and again. In fact, it might make you smile and feel good to be a human at that point.ML is useful anywhere you need to recognize patterns and predict behavior based on historical data. Recognizing patterns could mean anything from character recognition to predictive maintenance to recommending products to customers based on past purchases.This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: Correlation Between ML and Artificial LearningThe Era of EvolutionML and AI in PracticeSelf-Driving CarsRobots and How they will Change Our LivesML, AI and IoTEthics of AIAI and PrivacyIs Artificial Intelligence Dangerous?Will Humans and Artificial Intelligence Live Together in the Future?...

We, all in all, understand that Siri, Google Now, and Cortana are generally adroit propelled individual accomplices on various stages (iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). Basically, they help discover important information when you demand it is using your voice; you can say ""Where's the nearest Indian restaurant?"", ""What's on my schedule today?"" ""Remind me to call Mom or Dad at eight o'clock,"" and the partner will respond by finding information, giving off information from your phone, or sending headings to various applications. Reproduced knowledge is noteworthy in these applications, as they accumulate information on your sales and use that information to all the more probable see your talk and serve you results that are specially designed to your tendencies. Microsoft says that Cortana ""determinedly gets some answers concerning its customer"" and that it will, at last, develop the ability to imagine customers' needs. Virtual individual associates process a huge proportion of data from an arrangement of sources to get some answers concerning customers and be progressively convincing in helping them sort out and track their information. Your mobile phone, analyst, PC games, vehicle, bank, and your home all usage man-made thinking each day; every so often, it's prominent what it's doing, like when you ask Siri to get your orientation to the nearest administration station. To a great extent it's increasingly unobtrusive, like when you make a peculiar purchase on your Mastercard and don't get a deception alert from your bank. Man-made consciousness is everywhere, and it's created a huge complexity in our lives every day. Thusly, we can say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the piece of PC sciences that underlines the headway of knowledge machines, thinking, and working as individuals. For example, talk affirmation, basic reasoning, learning, and orchestrating. Today, Artificial Intelligence is an outstanding subject that is by and large inspected in the advancement and business circles. Various masters and industry specialists battle that AI or AI is the future - yet in case we look around, we are induced that it's not the future - it is the present.

Specifically, machine learning models as valuable tools for verifying hypotheses or revealing significant patterns hidden in datasets are presented in detail. Stylometry is a multi-disciplinary field combining linguistics with both statistics and computer science. The content is divided into three parts. The first, which consists of the first three chapters, offers a general introduction to stylometry, its potential applications and limitations. Further, it introduces the ongoing example used to illustrate the concepts discussed throughout the remainder of the book. The four chapters of the second part are more devoted to computer science with a focus on machine learning models. Their main aim is to explain machine learning models for solving stylometric problems. Several general strategies used to identify, extract, select, and represent stylistic markers are explained. As deep learning represents an active field of research, information on neural network models and word embeddings applied to stylometry is provided, as well as a general introduction to the deep learning approach to solving stylometric questions. In turn, the third part illustrates the application of the previously discussed approaches in real cases: an authorship attribution problem, seeking to discover the secret hand behind the nom de plume Elena Ferrante, an Italian writer known worldwide for her My Brilliant Friend's saga; author profiling in order to identify whether a set of tweets were generated by a bot or a human being and in this second case, whether it is a man or a woman; and an exploration of stylistic variations over time using US political speeches covering a period of ca. 230 years. A solutions-based approach is adopted throughout the book, and explanations are supported by examples written in R. To complement the main content and discussions on stylometric models and techniques, examples and datasets are freely available at the author's Github website.

We, all in all, understand that Siri, Google Now, and Cortana are generally adroit propelled individual accomplices on various stages (iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). Basically, they help discover important information when you demand it is using your voice; you can say ""Where's the nearest Indian restaurant?"", ""What's on my schedule today?"" ""Remind me to call Mom or Dad at eight o'clock,"" and the partner will respond by finding information, giving off information from your phone, or sending headings to various applications. Reproduced knowledge is noteworthy in these applications, as they accumulate information on your sales and use that information to all the more probable see your talk and serve you results that are specially designed to your tendencies. Microsoft says that Cortana ""determinedly gets some answers concerning its customer"" and that it will, at last, develop the ability to imagine customers' needs. Virtual individual associates process a huge proportion of data from an arrangement of sources to get some answers concerning customers and be progressively convincing in helping them sort out and track their information. Your mobile phone, analyst, PC games, vehicle, bank, and your home all usage man-made thinking each day; every so often, it's prominent what it's doing, like when you ask Siri to get your orientation to the nearest administration station. To a great extent it's increasingly unobtrusive, like when you make a peculiar purchase on your Mastercard and don't get a deception alert from your bank. Man-made consciousness is everywhere, and it's created a huge complexity in our lives every day. Thusly, we can say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the piece of PC sciences that underlines the headway of knowledge machines, thinking, and working as individuals. For example, talk affirmation, basic reasoning, learning, and orchestrating.

Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython? SettingiUp the Environment in PythonK - Nearest Neighbor AlgorithmsMeans ClusteringNeural Networks - Linear ClassifiersWhile most books focus on advanced predictive models, this book begins to explain the basic concepts and how to correctly implement Data Science and Machine Learning, with practical examples and simple coding scripts.

Was Rahman's AI and Machine Learning achieves that rare balance of making a difficult and complex topic accessible to non-specialists, without dumbing down.   He starts with an enlightening and entertaining explanation of what artificial intelligence (AI) is and how it works. This includes often-overlooked fundamentals like what we actually mean by 'intelligence', artificial or otherwise.   Rahman brings his explanations to life with lucid and, at times, surprising examples of AI already in use around us. He takes these back to first principles, deftly avoiding any need to understand the maths or computing involved. This allows him to demystify what the technology is really doing and show us that much of it is reassuringly mundane, despite the hype.  This distinctive approach comes into its own when examining the challenges and risks of AI. It allows the author to remove the drama and fear of sensationalized headlines and doom-laden movie plots. In their place, he offers an insightful analysis of how the major issues surface, what options we have for addressing them and why some dilemmas may prove intractable.  A must-read to understand the reality and implications of AI beyond the hype!

This open access book presents the first comprehensive overview of general methods in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), collects descriptions of existing systems based on these methods, and discusses the first series of international challenges of AutoML systems. The recent success of commercial ML applications and the rapid growth of the field has created a high demand for off-the-shelf ML methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. However, many of the recent machine learning successes crucially rely on human experts, who manually select appropriate ML architectures (deep learning architectures or more traditional ML workflows) and their hyperparameters. To overcome this problem, the field of AutoML targets a progressive automation of machine learning, based on principles from optimization and machine learning itself. This book serves as a point of entry into this quickly-developing field for researchers and advanced students alike, as well as providing a reference for practitioners aiming to use AutoML in their work.

Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython? SettingiUp the Environment in PythonK - Nearest Neighbor AlgorithmsMeans ClusteringNeural Networks - Linear ClassifiersWhile most books focus on advanced predictive models, this book begins to explain the basic concepts and how to correctly implement Data Science and Machine Learning, with practical examples and simple coding scripts. This guide provides the necessary knowledge in a practical way.

Machine learning has taken time to move into the space of academic economics. This is because empirical research in economics is concentrated on the identification of causal relationships in parsimonious statistical models; whereas machine learning is oriented towards prediction and is generally uninterested in either causality or parsimony. That leaves a gap for students, academics, and professionals who lack a standard reference on machine learning for economics and finance. This book focuses on economic and financial problems with an empirical dimension, where machine learning methods may offer something of value. This includes coverage of a variety of discriminative deep learning models (DNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, and DQNs), generative machine learning models (GANs and VAEs), and tree-based models. It also covers the intersection of empirical methods in economics and machine learning, including regression analysis, natural language processing, and dimensionality reduction. TensorFlow offers a toolset that can be used to define and solve any graph-based model, including those commonly used in economics. This book is structured to teach through a sequence of complete examples, each framed in terms of a specific economic problem of interest or topic. This simplifies otherwise complicated concepts, enabling the reader to solve workhorse theoretical models in economics and finance using TensorFlow.

Big data in information technology is a set of processing methods and means of structured and unstructured, dynamic, heterogeneous big data for their analysis and use of the decision support. To capture all the complex data streaming into systems from various sources, businesses have turned to data lakes. Often on the cloud, these are storage repositories that hold an enormous amount of data until it's ready to be analyzed: raw or refined, and structured or unstructured. A well-architected data lake should provide an environment to build data science models using open source languages such as R, Python or Scala. Strong integration with open repositories is must to recommend the best algorithm for use cases.

Conventionally, physicians follow a cognitive decision making process, the appropriateness of which develops with experience and knowledge gained from literature, lectures etc. Having inadequate knowledge or experience may lead to misdiagnosis of diseases consequently affecting the patient physically, emotionally, financially and so on. Using data mining techniques, it is possible to develop accurate diagnostic models that can be used in clinical decision making. Adopting such models in clinical practice may ensure better decision making thereby decreasing the rate of misdiagnosis, minimising the uneasiness, pain and anxiety that is associated with a disease through early detection and treatment. In this thesis, (i) the performance of standard classification algorithms in CKD detection was explored (ii) a new hybrid approach to accurately diagnose CKD is presented and (iii) the application of distributed random forest algorithm for developing generalized model for CKD diagnosis was proposed.

This work presents a framework based on a self-learning genetic algorithm for discovering prediction patterns in financial time series. By modifying a complex mathematical algorithm for evolutionary optimization in a manner more suitable for financial time series, specifics typical to asset trading were taken into account and were reflected in the solution set. In-sample the genetic algorithm was able to successfully find prediction rules allowing for the creation of successful, feasible and robust trading strategies with high performance. In order to justify the in-sample performance, the prediction patterns were tested on an out-of -sample time period: the results confirmed the ability of the genetic algorithm to find prediction patterns with robust performance. The proposed framework shows great potential when working with high dimensional search spaces and in finding non-linear dependencies in financial data.

 This book investigates the application of promising machine learning techniques to address two problems: (i) how to find profitable pairs while constraining the search space and (ii) how to avoid long decline periods due to prolonged divergent pairs. It also proposes the integration of an unsupervised learning algorithm, OPTICS, to handle problem (i), and demonstrates that the suggested technique can outperform the common pairs search methods, achieving an average portfolio Sharpe ratio of 3.79, in comparison to 3.58 and 2.59 obtained using standard approaches. For problem (ii), the authors introduce a forecasting-based trading model capable of reducing the periods of portfolio decline by 75%. However, this comes at the expense of decreasing overall profitability. The authors also test the proposed strategy using an ARMA model, an LSTM and an LSTM encoder-decoder.

This thesis proposes machine learning methods for understanding scenes via behaviour analysis and online anomaly detection in video. The book introduces novel Bayesian topic models for detection of events that are different from typical activities and a novel framework for change point detection for identifying sudden behavioural changes.Behaviour analysis and anomaly detection are key components of intelligent vision systems. Anomaly detection can be considered from two perspectives: abnormal events can be defined as those that violate typical activities or as a sudden change in behaviour. Topic modelling and change-point detection methodologies, respectively, are employed to achieve these objectives.The thesis starts with the development of learning algorithms for a dynamic topic model, which extract topics that represent typical activities of a scene. These typical activities are used in a normality measure in anomaly detection decision-making. The book also proposes a novel anomaly localisation procedure. In the first topic model presented, a number of topics should be specified in advance. A novel dynamic nonparametric hierarchical Dirichlet process topic model is then developed where the number of topics is determined from data. Batch and online inference algorithms are developed.The latter part of the thesis considers behaviour analysis and anomaly detection within the change-point detection methodology. A novel general framework for change-point detection is introduced. Gaussian process time series data is considered. Statistical hypothesis tests are proposed for both offline and online data processing and multiple change point detection are proposed and theoretical properties of the tests are derived.  The thesis is accompanied by open-source toolboxes that can be used by researchers and engineers.

Towards the end of the workshop, you'll study the dataset of a bank's marketing activities and build machine learning models that can list clients who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. You'll also learn how to compare these models and select the optimal one. By the end of The Machine Learning Workshop, you'll not only have learned the difference between supervised and unsupervised models and their applications in the real world, but you'll also have developed the skills required to get started with programming your very own machine learning algorithms. What you will learn  Understand how to select an algorithm that best fits your dataset and desired outcome Explore popular real-world algorithms such as K-means, Mean-Shift, and DBSCAN Discover different approaches to solve machine learning classification problems Develop neural network structures using the scikit-learn package Use the NN algorithm to create models for predicting future outcomes Perform error analysis to improve your model's performance  Who this book is for The Machine Learning Workshop is perfect for machine learning beginners. You will need Python programming experience, though no prior knowledge of scikit-learn and machine learning is necessary.

In the last few years the scientific community has realized that obtaining a better understanding of interactions between natural systems and the man-made environment across different scales demands more research efforts in remote sensing. An integrated Earth system observatory that merges surface-based, air-borne, space-borne, and even underground sensors with comprehensive and predictive capabilities indicates promise for revolutionizing the study of global water, energy, and carbon cycles as well as land use and land cover changes. The aim of this book is to present a suite of relevant concepts, tools, and methods of integrated multisensor data fusion and machine learning technologies to promote environmental sustainability. The process of machine learning for intelligent feature extraction consists of regular, deep, and fast learning algorithms. The niche for integrating data fusion and machine learning for remote sensing rests upon the creation of a new scientific architecture in remote sensing science that is designed to support numerical as well as symbolic feature extraction managed by several cognitively oriented machine learning tasks at finer scales. By grouping a suite of satellites with similar nature in platform design, data merging may come to help for cloudy pixel reconstruction over the space domain or concatenation of time series images over the time domain, or even both simultaneously. Organized in 5 parts, from Fundamental Principles of Remote Sensing; Feature Extraction for Remote Sensing; Image and Data Fusion for Remote Sensing; Integrated Data Merging, Data Reconstruction, Data Fusion, and Machine Learning; to Remote Sensing for Environmental Decision Analysis, the book will be a useful reference for graduate students, academic scholars, and working professionals who are involved in the study of Earth systems and the environment for a sustainable future. The new knowledge in this book can be applied successfully in many areas of environmental science and engineering.

Master's Thesis from the year 2019 in the subject Computer Sciences - Artificial Intelligence, grade: 88.2, Institute of Technology Carlow, language: English, abstract: Adverse Drug Reactions contribute to $ 7.2 billion in medical expenses annually in the United States alone. Apart from economic impact, the adverse drug reactions are one of the main causes of deaths in developed countries. An ability to predict adverse drug reaction outcomes or identify patients that are likely to experience adverse drug reactions after ingesting medicinal drug product can reduce the fatality rates and financial burden associated with medical treatments of patients experiencing adverse drug reactions. To date, two studies attempted to predict adverse drug reactions with use of machine learning algorithms and Food and Drug Administration database. However, one of them did not provide sufficient accuracy scores and the other was a small-scale proof of concept study. This research has built on top of these two studies and aimed to improve predictive results and provide more specific adverse drug reaction predictive labels. Two deep, fully connected Neural Networks have been created to predict adverse drug reaction outcomes. Model 7 and the Binary Model. The model 7 was a multi-label classification algorithm that was trained to classify patients that were hospitalised, died or have been hospitalised then died. The binary model was trained to segregate the adverse drug reaction outcomes to 2 classes - hospitalisation and death. The multiclass Model-7 achieved similar performance (74 % accuracy) to standard machine learning (binary) models generated in previous studies. However, it did not achieve better performance than binary proof of concept Artificial Neural Network model built by other researchers. The binary Artificial Neural Network model created in this study, significantly outperformed other binary standard machine learning models designed in past by achieving 83 % of accuracy

What do financial data prediction, day-trading rule development, and bio-marker selection have in common? They are just a few of the tasks that could potentially be resolved with genetic programming and machine learning techniques. Written by leaders in this field, Applied Genetic Programming and Machine Learning delineates the extension of Genetic Programming (GP) for practical applications. Reflecting rapidly developing concepts and emerging paradigms, this book outlines how to use machine learning techniques, make learning operators that efficiently sample a search space, navigate the search process through the design of objective fitness functions, and examine the search performance of the evolutionary system. It provides a methodology for integrating GP and machine learning techniques, establishing a robust evolutionary framework for addressing tasks from areas such as chaotic time-series prediction, system identification, financial forecasting, classification, and data mining. The book provides a starting point for the research of extended GP frameworks with the integration of several machine learning schemes. Drawing on empirical studies taken from fields such as system identification, finanical engineering, and bio-informatics, it demonstrates how the proposed methodology can be useful in practical inductive problem solving.

This book lies at the interface of machine learning - a subfield of computer science that develops algorithms for challenging tasks such as shape or image recognition, where traditional algorithms fail - and photonics - the physical science of light, which underlies many of the optical communications technologies used in our information society. It provides a thorough introduction to reservoir computing and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).Recently, photonic implementations of reservoir computing (a machine learning algorithm based on artificial neural networks) have made a breakthrough in optical computing possible. In this book, the author pushes the performance of these systems significantly beyond what was achieved before. By interfacing a photonic reservoir computer with a high-speed electronic device (an FPGA), the author successfully interacts with the reservoir computer in real time, allowing him to considerably expand its capabilities and range of possible applications. Furthermore, the author draws on his expertise in machine learning and FPGA programming to make progress on a very different problem, namely the real-time image analysis of optical coherence tomography for atherosclerotic arteries.

This book focuses on how machine learning techniques can be used to analyze and make use of one particular category of behavioral biometrics known as the gait biometric. A comprehensive Ground Reaction Force (GRF)-based Gait Biometrics Recognition framework is proposed and validated by experiments. In addition, an in-depth analysis of existing recognition techniques that are best suited for performing footstep GRF-based person recognition is also proposed, as well as a comparison of feature extractors, normalizers, and classifiers configurations that were never directly compared with one another in any previous GRF recognition research. Finally, a detailed theoretical overview of many existing machine learning techniques is presented, leading to a proposal of two novel data processing techniques developed specifically for the purpose of gait biometric recognition using GRF.This book- introduces novel machine-learning-based temporal normalization techniques- bridges research gaps concerning the effect of footwear and stepping speed on footstep GRF-based person recognition- provides detailed discussions of key research challenges and open research issues in gait biometrics recognition- compares biometrics systems trained and tested with the same footwear against those trained and tested with different footwear

The BIRS Workshop ""Advances in Interactive Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Complex and Big Data Sets"" (15w2181), held in July 2015 in Banff, Canada, was dedicated to stimulating a cross-domain integrative machine-learning approach and appraisal of ""hot topics"" toward tackling the grand challenge of reaching a level of useful and useable computational intelligence with a focus on real-world problems, such as in the health domain. This encompasses learning from prior data, extracting and discovering knowledge, generalizing the results, fighting the curse of dimensionality, and ultimately disentangling the underlying explanatory factors in complex data, i.e., to make sense of data within the context of the application domain. The workshop aimed to contribute advancements in promising novel areas such as at the intersection of machine learning and topological data analysis. History has shown that most often the overlapping areas at intersections of seemingly disparate fields are key for the stimulation of new insights and further advances. This is particularly true for the extremely broad field of machine learning.

A concise overview of machine learning--computer programs that learn from data--which underlies applications that include recommendation systems, face recognition, and driverless cars.Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition--as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as ""Big Data"" has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning--the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge--has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of ""data science,"" and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.

Doctoral Thesis / Dissertation from the year 2015 in the subject Computer Sciences - Artificial Intelligence, grade: -, University of Stirling (Computing Science and Mathematics), language: English, abstract: Clinical risk assessment of chronic illnesses is a challenging and complex task which requires the utilisation of standardised clinical practice guidelines and documentation procedures in order to ensure consistent and efficient patient care. Conventional cardiovascular decision support systems have significant limitations, which include the inflexibility to deal with complex clinical processes, hard-wired rigid architectures based on branching logic and the inability to deal with legacy patient data without significant software engineering work. In light of these challenges, we are proposing a novel ontology and machine learning-driven hybrid clinical decision support framework for cardiovascular preventative care. An ontology-inspired approach provides a foundation for information collection, knowledge acquisition and decision support capabilities and aims to develop context sensitive decision support solutions based on ontology engineering principles. The proposed framework incorporates an ontology-driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system (ODCRARS) and a Machine Learning Driven Prognostic System (MLDPS), integrated as a complete system to provide a cardiovascular preventative care solution. The proposed clinical decision support framework has been developed under the close supervision of clinical domain experts from both UK and US hospitals and is capable of handling multiple cardiovascular diseases.

Machine Translation and Transliteration involving Related, Low-resource Languages discusses an important aspect of natural language processing that has received lesser attention: translation and transliteration involving related languages in a low-resource setting. This is a very relevant real-world scenario for people living in neighbouring states/provinces/countries who speak similar languages and need to communicate with each other, but training data to build supporting MT systems is limited. The book discusses different characteristics of related languages with rich examples and draws connections between two problems: translation for related languages and transliteration. It shows how linguistic similarities can be utilized to learn MT systems for related languages with limited data. It comprehensively discusses the use of subword-level models and multilinguality to utilize these linguistic similarities. The second part of the book explores methods for machine transliteration involving related languages based on multilingual and unsupervised approaches. Through extensive experiments over a wide variety of languages, the efficacy of these methods is established.

The story of innovation isn't always told in novels. Sometimes it evolves from ingenuity, curiosity, and sheer will. That is the story of Lean--before we called it ""Lean."" The Progressive Machine is Stephen Weller's definitive primer on how a very important concept in production and service excellence came into being. Like the philosophy itself, the ideas neither start nor end here, helping to develop a leadership mindset that not only continuously improves, but also continues to grow. That is the heart of Lean. By always looking for better ways to think and do things, we are always changing the world, one step at a time.  This book is less about the concepts and more about the people who brought them to life. These innovators saw opportunities to increase the value of the work around them. In doing so, they each laid the foundation for what is now considered an integral part of how to operate.

The human body is a machine. This machine is composed of organs, which in turn are made of tissues, cells, molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. And like any physical entity, the human body depends on physical laws. The laws of physics are our basic tool for understanding the functioning of any machine, including biological organisms. Biology is, after all, applied chemistry; and chemistry is really just applied physics. But physical laws by themselves are not sufficient to characterize physical mechanisms. Interaction between elements is of fundamental importance, and a machine is generally better described as a system. The complex machine that we know as the human body is perhaps optimally studied under the umbrella of systems theory.

Handloom provides good quality but the weavers are prone to health issues due to long hours of static work. This is because the quality of handloom relies in the synchronous actuation of reed and pedals. The proposed system is for the automation of the handloom. It involves the use of pneumatic actuator and sensors to replace the manual effort. Various sensors such as ultrasonic sensor, proximity sensor and limit switches are used to get information from the various parts of the handloom. The controller will use the sensor information to put the air cylinders in motion. In our system, the actuation of the reed is done by the operator of the loom and rest of the actuation is done with the use of pneumatic actuators.

The genesis of the digital idea and why it transformed civilization A few short decades ago, we were informed by the smooth signals of analog television and radio; we communicated using our analog telephones; and we even computed with analog computers. Today our world is digital, built with zeros and ones. Why did this revolution occur? The Discrete Charm of the Machine explains, in an engaging and accessible manner, the varied physical and logical reasons behind this radical transformation. The spark of individual genius shines through this story of innovation: the stored program of Jacquard's loom; Charles Babbage's logical branching; Alan Turing's brilliant abstraction of the discrete machine; Harry Nyquist's foundation for digital signal processing; Claude Shannon's breakthrough insights into the meaning of information and bandwidth; and Richard Feynman's prescient proposals for nanotechnology and quantum computing. Ken Steiglitz follows the progression of these ideas in the building of our digital world, from the internet and artificial intelligence to the edge of the unknown. Are questions like the famous traveling salesman problem truly beyond the reach of ordinary digital computers? Can quantum computers transcend these barriers? Does a mysterious magical power reside in the analog mechanisms of the brain? Steiglitz concludes by confronting the moral and aesthetic questions raised by the development of artificial intelligence and autonomous robots. The Discrete Charm of the Machine examines why our information technology, the lifeblood of our civilization, became digital, and challenges us to think about where its future trajectory may lead.

The commonly used manual harvesting of onion is time consuming, less efficient and full of drudgery so the mechanization of harvesting is essentially needed. One of the main reasons of low productivity is insufficient man power availability on the farm and low level of farm mechanization. This is especially true for India. This prototype will be small and less costly compared to other harvesting machinery and provides efficient and effective method for harvesting to reduce human effort which is useful for small scale farmers. When the engine is started, the shaft starts to rotate along with the digger. The digger digs into the ground due to the rotation of the shaft. The assembled setup of digger carries the onion and throws it on to the conveyor. The conveyor is equipped with strips to hold the onion. The onion is carried by the conveyor and is deposited in the container. Due to motion of the machine the vibration is generated which in turn separates the soil from the onion.

It is also valuable for researchers and practitioners in environmental sciences interested in applying these new methods to their own work.  Preface Excerpt  Machine learning is a major subfield in computational intelligence (also called artificial intelligence). Its main objective is to use computational methods to extract information from data. Neural network methods, generally regarded as forming the first wave of breakthrough in machine learning, became popular in the late 1980s, while kernel methods arrived in a second wave in the second half of the 1990s. This is the first single-authored textbook to give a unified treatment of machine learning methods and their applications in the environmental sciences.  Machine learning methods began to infiltrate the environmental sciences in the 1990s. Today, thanks to their powerful nonlinear modeling capability, they are no longer an exotic fringe species, as they are heavily used in satellite data processing, in general circulation models (GCM), in weather and climate prediction, air quality forecasting, analysis and modeling of environmental data, oceanographic and hydrological forecasting, ecological modeling, and in the monitoring of snow, ice and forests, etc.  This book presents machine learning methods and their applications in the environmental sciences (including satellite remote sensing, atmospheric science, climate science, oceanography, hydrology and ecology), written at a level suitable for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates. It is also valuable for researchers and practitioners in environmental sciences interested in applying these new methods to their own work.  Chapters 1-3, intended mainly as background material for students, cover the standard statistical methods used in environmental sciences. The machine learning methods of chapters 4-12 provide powerful nonlinear generalizations for many of these standard linear statistical methods. End-of-chapter review questions are included, allowing readers to develop their problem-solving skills and monitor their understanding of the material presented. An appendix lists websites available for downloading computer code and data sources. A resources website is available containing datasets for exercises, and additional material to keep the book completely up-to-date.  About the Author  WILLIAM W.

Deep Learning for Chest Radiographs enumerates different strategies implemented by the authors for designing an efficient convolution neural network-based computer-aided classification (CAC) system for binary classification of chest radiographs into Normal and Pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infectious disease mostly caused by a bacteria or a virus. The prime targets of this infectious disease are children below the age of 5 and adults above the age of 65, mostly due to their poor immunity and lower rates of recovery. Globally, pneumonia has prevalent footprints and kills more children as compared to any other immunity-based disease, causing up to 15% of child deaths per year, especially in developing countries. Out of all the available imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, radiography or X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and so on, chest radiographs are most widely used for differential diagnosis between Normal and Pneumonia. In the CAC system designs implemented in this book, a total of 200 chest radiograph images consisting of 100 Normal images and 100 Pneumonia images have been used. These chest radiographs are augmented using geometric transformations, such as rotation, translation, and flipping, to increase the size of the dataset for efficient training of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A total of 12 experiments were conducted for the binary classification of chest radiographs into Normal and Pneumonia. It also includes in-depth implementation strategies of exhaustive experimentation carried out using transfer learning-based approaches with decision fusion, deep feature extraction, feature selection, feature dimensionality reduction, and machine learning-based classifiers for implementation of end-to-end CNN-based CAC system designs, lightweight CNN-based CAC system designs, and hybrid CAC system designs for chest radiographs. This book is a valuable resource for academicians, researchers, clinicians, postgraduate and graduate students in medical imaging, CAC, computer-aided diagnosis, computer science and engineering, electrical and electronics engineering, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics, bioengineering, and professionals from the IT industry.

This book discusses the impact of advanced information technologies, such as data processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, on organizational decision-making processes and practices. One of the book's central themes is the interplay between human reasoning and machine logic in the context of organizational functioning, specifically, the fairly common situations in which subjective beliefs are pitted against objective evidence giving rise to conflict rather than enhancing the quality of organizational sensemaking. Aiming to not only raise the awareness of the potential challenges but also to offer solutions, the book delineates and discusses the core impediments to effective human-information technology interactions, and outlines strategies for overcoming those obstacles on the way to enhancing the efficacy of organizational decision-making.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our everyday life. Many AI algorithms have reached human-level performance and AI agents are replacing humans in most professions. It is predicted that this trend will continue and 30% of work activities in 60% of current occupations will be automated.This success, however, is conditioned on availability of huge annotated datasets to training AI models. Data annotation is a time-consuming and expensive task which still is being performed by human workers. Learning efficiently from less data is a next step for making AI more similar to natural intelligence. Transfer learning has been suggested a remedy to relax the need for data annotation. The core idea in transfer learning is to transfer knowledge across similar tasks and use similarities and previously learned knowledge to learn more efficiently.In this book, we provide a brief background on transfer learning and then focus on the idea of transferring knowledge through intermediate embedding spaces. The idea is to couple and relate different learning through embedding spaces that encode task-level relations and similarities. We cover various machine learning scenarios and demonstrate that this idea can be used to overcome challenges of zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, domain adaptation, continual learning, lifelong learning, and collaborative learning.

This method is to automatically deduce the insertion, deletion and substitution costs of the Graph edit distance. The method is based on embedding the ground-truth node-to-node mappings into a Euclidean space and learning the edit costs through the hyperplane that splits the nodes into mapped ones and non-mapped ones in this new space. In this way, the algorithm does not need to compute any graph matching process, which is the main drawback of other methods due to its intrin- sic exponential computational complexity. Nevertheless, our learning method has two main restrictions: 1) the insertion and deletion edit costs have to be constants; 2) the substitution edit costs have to be represented as inner products of two vectors. One vector represents certain weights and the other vector represents the distances between attributes. Experimental validation shows that the matching accuracy of this method outperforms the current methods. Furthermore, there is a significant reduction in the runtime in the learning process.This book has main contributions in learning cost based on embedding.

Identifying and managing such earthly changes in an automatic way poses a worth-addressing challenge, in which remote sensing technology can have a fundamental role to answer-at least partially-such demands. The recent advent of cutting-edge processing facilities has fostered the adoption of deep learning architectures owing to their generalization capabilities. In this respect, it seems evident that the pace of deep learning in the remote sensing domain remains somewhat lagging behind that of its computer vision counterpart. This is due to the scarce availability of ground truth information in comparison with other computer vision domains. In this book, we aim at advancing the state of the art in linking deep learning methodologies with remote sensing image processing by collecting 20 contributions from different worldwide scientists and laboratories. The book presents a wide range of methodological advancements in the deep learning field that come with different applications in the remote sensing landscape such as wildfire and postdisaster damage detection, urban forest mapping, vine disease and pavement marking detection, desert road mapping, road and building outline extraction, vehicle and vessel detection, water identification, and text-to-image matching.

The term Federated Learning was coined as recently as 2016 to describe a machine learning setting where multiple entities collaborate in solving a machine learning problem, under the coordination of a central server or service provider. Each client's raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred; instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective. Since then, the topic has gathered much interest across many different disciplines and the realization that solving many of these interdisciplinary problems likely requires not just machine learning but techniques from distributed optimization, cryptography, security, differential privacy, fairness, compressed sensing, systems, information theory, statistics, and more. This monograph has contributions from leading experts across the disciplines, who describe the latest state-of-the art from their perspective. These contributions have been carefully curated into a comprehensive treatment that enables the reader to understand the work that has been done and get pointers to where effort is required to solve many of the problems before Federated Learning can become a reality in practical systems. Researchers working in the area of distributed systems will find this monograph an enlightening read that may inspire them to work on the many challenging issues that are outlined. This monograph will get the reader up to speed quickly and easily on what is likely to become an increasingly important topic: Federated Learning.

This imaginative and empowering book explores the ways that our emotions entangle us with climate change and offers strategies for engaging with climate anxiety that can contribute to social transformation.  Climate educator Blanche Verlie draws on feminist, more-than-human and affect theories to argue that people in high-carbon societies need to learn to 'live-with' climate change: to appreciate that human lives are interconnected with the climate, and to cultivate the emotional capacities needed to respond to the climate crisis. Learning to Live with Climate Change explores the cultural, interpersonal and sociological dimensions of ecological distress. The book engages with Australia's 2019/2020 'Black Summer' of bushfires and smoke, undergraduate students' experiences of climate change, and contemporary activist movements such as the youth strikes for climate. Verlie outlines how we can collectively attune to, live with, and respond to the unsettling realities of climate collapse while counteracting domineering ideals of 'climate control.' This impressive and timely work is both deeply philosophical and immediately practical. Its accessible style and real-world relevance ensure it will be valued by those researching, studying and working in diverse fields such as sustainability education, climate communication, human geography, cultural studies, environmental sociology and eco-psychology, as well as the broader public.

The integrated and advanced science research topic man-machine-environment system engineering (MMESE) was first established in China by Professor Shengzhao Long in 1981, with direct support from one of the greatest modern Chinese scientists, Xuesen Qian. In a letter to Shengzhao Long from October 22nd, 1993, Xuesen Qian wrote: ""You have created a very important modern science and technology in China!"" MMESE primarily focuses on the relationship between man, machines and the environment, studying the optimum combination of man-machine-environment systems. In this system, ""man"" refers to people in the workplace (e.g. operators, decision-makers); "" machine"" is the general name for any object controlled by man (including tools, machinery, computers, systems and technologies), and ""environment"" describes the specific working conditions under which man and machine interact (e.g. temperature, noise, vibration, hazardous gases etc.). The three goals of optimization of man-machine-environment systems are to ensure safety, efficiency and economy. Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Man-Machine-Environment System Engineering are an academic showcase of the best papers selected from more than 400 submissions, introducing readers to the top research topics and the latest developmental trends in the theory and application of MMESE. These proceedings are interdisciplinary studies on the concepts and methods of physiology, psychology, system engineering, computer science, environment science, management, education, and other related disciplines. Researchers and professionals working in these interdisciplinary fields and researchers on MMESE related topics will benefit from these proceedings.

Learning to solve sequential decision-making tasks is difficult. Humans take years exploring the environment essentially in a random way until they are able to reason, solve difficult tasks, and collaborate with other humans towards a common goal. Artificial Intelligent agents are like humans in this aspect. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique to train autonomous agents through interactions with the environment. Unfortunately, the learning process has a high sample complexity to infer an effective actuation policy, especially when multiple agents are simultaneously actuating in the environment. However, previous knowledge can be leveraged to accelerate learning and enable solving harder tasks. In the same way humans build skills and reuse them by relating different tasks, RL agents might reuse knowledge from previously solved tasks and from the exchange of knowledge with other agents in the environment. In fact, virtually all of the most challenging tasks currently solved by RL rely on embedded knowledge reuse techniques, such as Imitation Learning, Learning from Demonstration, and Curriculum Learning. This book surveys the literature on knowledge reuse in multiagent RL. The authors define a unifying taxonomy of state-of-the-art solutions for reusing knowledge, providing a comprehensive discussion of recent progress in the area. In this book, readers will find a comprehensive discussion of the many ways in which knowledge can be reused in multiagent sequential decision-making tasks, as well as in which scenarios each of the approaches is more efficient. The authors also provide their view of the current low-hanging fruit developments of the area, as well as the still-open big questions that could result in breakthrough developments. Finally, the book provides resources to researchers who intend to join this area or leverage those techniques, including a list of conferences, journals, and implementation tools. This book will be useful for a wide audience; and will hopefully promote new dialogues across communities and novel developments in the area.

In the last decades robots are expected to be of increasing intelligence to deal with a large range of tasks. Especially, robots are supposed to be able to learn manipulation skills from humans. To this end, a number of learning algorithms and techniques have been developed and successfully implemented for various robotic tasks. Among these methods, learning from demonstrations (LfD) enables robots to effectively and efficiently acquire skills by learning from human demonstrators, such that a robot can be quickly programmed to perform a new task.This book introduces recent results on the development of advanced LfD-based learning and control approaches to improve the robot dexterous manipulation. First, there's an introduction to the simulation tools and robot platforms used in the authors' research. In order to enable a robot learning of human-like adaptive skills, the book explains how to transfer a human user's arm variable stiffness to the robot, based on the online estimation from the muscle electromyography (EMG). Next, the motion and impedance profiles can be both modelled by dynamical movement primitives such that both of them can be planned and generalized for new tasks. Furthermore, the book introduces how to learn the correlation between signals collected from demonstration, i.e., motion trajectory, stiffness profile estimated from EMG and interaction force, using statistical models such as hidden semi-Markov model and Gaussian Mixture Regression. Several widely used human-robot interaction interfaces (such as motion capture-based teleoperation) are presented, which allow a human user to interact with a robot and transfer movements to it in both simulation and real-word environments. Finally, improved performance of robot manipulation resulted from neural network enhanced control strategies is presented. A large number of examples of simulation and experiments of daily life tasks are included in this book to facilitate better understanding of the readers.

An examination of more than sixty years of successes and failures in developing technologies that allow computers to understand human spoken language.Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey famously featured HAL, a computer with the ability to hold lengthy conversations with his fellow space travelers. More than forty years later, we have advanced computer technology that Kubrick never imagined, but we do not have computers that talk and understand speech as HAL did. Is it a failure of our technology that we have not gotten much further than an automated voice that tells us to ""say or press 1""? Or is there something fundamental in human language and speech that we do not yet understand deeply enough to be able to replicate in a computer? In The Voice in the Machine, Roberto Pieraccini examines six decades of work in science and technology to develop computers that can interact with humans using speech and the industry that has arisen around the quest for these technologies. He shows that although the computers today that understand speech may not have HAL's capacity for conversation, they have capabilities that make them usable in many applications today and are on a fast track of improvement and innovation.Pieraccini describes the evolution of speech recognition and speech understanding processes from waveform methods to artificial intelligence approaches to statistical learning and modeling of human speech based on a rigorous mathematical model--specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMM). He details the development of dialog systems, the ability to produce speech, and the process of bringing talking machines to the market. Finally, he asks a question that only the future can answer: will we end up with HAL-like computers or something completely unexpected?

The present study developed an autonomous algorithm for the Convective cell Identification and TRAcking (CITRA) using DWR reflectivity images. The CITRA algorithm is implemented in Python using Deep learning technique of Neural Networks. Optical Character Recognition is used in the present study through ""Tesseract"" which is an unsupervised Neural Network module based on LSTM which analyses the input dimensional pixel array/image and outputs high-level strings. The algorithm runs through the DWR reflectivity image pixel values and recognizes the intensities of the pixels (>=30 dB) and segregates convective cells along with other estimated cell properties such as centroid of the storm, the area covered, distance and direction from the radar centre. The performance of CITRA algorithm was tested on different convective storms and it could successfully identify and track them along with other physical properties of the convective cells. Further, we have demonstrated the potential application of CITRA algorithm on the evolution of convective cells detected within the radar range. Presently, CITRA algorithm takes only reflectivity images as a single input parameter.

Go is rapidly becoming the preferred language for building web services. While there are plenty of tutorials available that teach Go's syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, tutorials aren't enough. They don't teach Go's idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don't make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.No matter your level of experience, you'll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. You'll also get a preview of Go's upcoming generics support and how it fits into the language.Learn how to write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go projectUnderstand the reasons for the design decisions in GoSet up a Go development environment for a solo developer or teamLearn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgoDiscover how Go's features allow the language to run efficientlyKnow which Go features you should use sparingly or not at all

In industry, there are different geometrical shapes to which an operator has to weld. Each and every shape carries its own operational constraints. Circular welding is one of the most critical welding process carried out manually, especially when accuracy and uniformity is of high concern. A manual mode of circular welding carries so many disadvantages like lower accuracy and precision, high wire, gas and electricity wastage, and frequent micro cracks. This gives rise to a need for automation for circular welding. The bulkiness and complexity of circular welding due to the presence of different holding arrangements and fixtures makes it expensive and highly time-consuming process. On the other hand, due to the complexity of the process, the availability of skilled worker is difficult. Moreover, due to monotonous and high concentration job schedule, worker fatigue becomes high and hence it forces the tendency of a worker to have high wages. To avoid these undesirable circumstances, the application demands the import of automation for this circular welding process. Welding automation worldwide utilizes different pneumatic and hydro pneumatic instrumentation.

John McCarthy, widely recognized as one of the godfathers of AI, defined it as ""the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."" In 1959, Arthur Samuel, one of the pioneers of machine learning, defined machine learning as a ""field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."" Machine-learning programs, in a sense, adjust themselves in response to the data they're exposed to (like a child that is born knowing nothing adjusts its understanding of the world in response to experience). Nowadays, what 21st century digital technology generation need is computer system able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. Machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that does something smart. Natural languages are those languages that are spoken by the people. It is difficult for an individual to know and understand all the languages of the world. Machine translation (MT) is the task of automatically translating a text from one natural language into another.

This book summarizes the latest developments in the area of human factors test and evaluation methods for automated vehicles. Future vehicles will allow a transition of responsibility from the driver to the automated driving system and vice versa. Drivers will have the opportunity to use a wide variety of different driver assistance systems within the same vehicle. This coexistence of different automation levels creates new challenges in the design of the vehicle's human-machine interface (HMI), which have to be accounted for by human factors experts, both in industrial design and in academia. This book brings together the latest developments, empirical evaluations and guidelines on various topics, such as the design and evaluation of interior as well as exterior HMIs for automated vehicles, and the assessment of the impact of automated vehicles on non-automated road users and driver state assessment (e.g., fatigue, motion sickness, fallback readiness) during automated driving.

Double excitation term indicates that the field flux of the machine is created by two sources: excitation windings and permanent magnets. The degree of freedom came from the excitation windings provides an opportunity to work on the energy efficiency improvement target. This book will try to answer the question whether DESM is more advantageous over classical machines in a specific driving cycle and additionally, in which circumstances, a DESM performs better. Recent studies have merely optimized individual components, the major drawback of this approach is that the combination of the best individuals does not necessarily form a best system. In order to achieve more realistic results, a multi-physics model taking into account nonlinear characteristics and various disciplines will be developed.

What is deep learning for those who study physics? Is it completely different from physics? Or is it similar? In recent years, machine learning, including deep learning, has begun to be used in various physics studies. Why is that? Is knowing physics useful in machine learning? Conversely, is knowing machine learning useful in physics? This book is devoted to answers of these questions. Starting with basic ideas of physics, neural networks are derived naturally. And you can learn the concepts of deep learning through the words of physics.In fact, the foundation of machine learning can be attributed to physical concepts. Hamiltonians that determine physical systems characterize various machine learning structures. Statistical physics given by Hamiltonians defines machine learning by neural networks. Furthermore, solving inverse problems in physics through machine learning and generalization essentially provides progress and even revolutions in physics. For these reasons, in recent years interdisciplinary research in machine learning and physics has been expanding dramatically. This book is written for anyone who wants to learn, understand, and apply the relationship between deep learning/machine learning and physics. All that is needed to read this book are the basic concepts in physics: energy and Hamiltonians. The concepts of statistical mechanics and the bracket notation of quantum mechanics, which are explained in columns, are used to explain deep learning frameworks.We encourage you to explore this new active field of machine learning and physics, with this book as a map of the continent to be explored.

This book strategically focuses upon the feasibility of positioning Indigenous Knowledge Systems into tertiary built environment education and research in Australia. Australian tertiary education has little engaged with Indigenous peoples and their Indigenous Knowledge Systems, and the respectful translation of their Indigenous Knowledge Systems into tertiary education learning. In contrast, while there has been a dearth of discussion and research on this topic pertaining to the tertiary sector, the secondary school sector has passionately pursued this topic. There is an uneasiness by the tertiary sector to engage in this realm, overwhelmed already by the imperatives of the Commonwealth's 'Closing the Gap' initiative to advance Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tertiary education successes and appointments of Indigenous academics. As a consequence, the teaching of Indigenous Knowledge Systems relevant to professional disciplines, particularly landscape architecture where it is most apt, is overlooked and similarly little addressed in the relevant professional institute education accreditation standards.

Transient stability control of electrical power systems considers the problem of loss of synchronism among synchronous generators when subjected to large disturbances. For the improvement of transient stability the general methods adopted are fast acting exciters, circuit breakers and reduction in system transfer reactance. The modern trend is to employ FACTS devices in the existing transmission system for effective utilization of existing transmission resources. UPFC is the most versatile FACTS device, which can control voltage, impedance and phase angle. It can independently control both real and reactive power. In this thesis, a Lyapunov-based neural network unified power flow controller(UPFC) is developed to improve the transient stability.

This book explores evidence-based practice in college science teaching. It is grounded in disciplinary education research by practicing scientists who have chosen to take Wieman's (2014) challenge seriously, and to investigate claims about the efficacy of alternative strategies in college science teaching. In editing this book, we have chosen to showcase outstanding cases of exemplary practice supported by solid evidence, and to include practitioners who offer models of teaching and learning that meet the high standards of the scientific disciplines. Our intention is to let these distinguished scientists speak for themselves and to offer authentic guidance to those who seek models of excellence. Our primary audience consists of the thousands of dedicated faculty and graduate students who teach undergraduate science at community and technical colleges, 4-year liberal arts institutions, comprehensive regional campuses, and flagship research universities.  In keeping with Wieman's challenge, our primary focus has been on identifying classroom practices that encourage and support meaningful learning and conceptual understanding in the natural sciences. The content is structured as follows: after an Introduction based on Constructivist Learning Theory (Section I), the practices we explore are Eliciting Ideas and Encouraging Reflection (Section II); Using Clickers to Engage Students (Section III); Supporting Peer Interaction through Small Group Activities (Section IV); Restructuring Curriculum and Instruction (Section V); Rethinking the Physical Environment (Section VI); Enhancing Understanding with Technology (Section VII), and Assessing Understanding (Section VIII). The book's final section (IX) is devoted to Professional Issues facing college and university faculty who choose to adopt active learning in their courses.   The common feature underlying all of the strategies described in this book is their emphasis on actively engaging students who seek to make sense of natural objects and events. Many of the strategies we highlight emerge from a constructivist view of learning that has gained widespread acceptance in recent years. In this view, learners make sense of the world by forging connections between new ideas and those that are part of their existing knowledge base. For most students, that knowledge base is riddled with a host of na簿ve notions, misconceptions and alternative conceptions they have acquired throughout their lives. To a considerable extent, the job of the teacher is to coax out these ideas; to help students understand how their ideas differ from the scientifically accepted view; to assist as students restructure and reconcile their newly acquired knowledge; and to provide opportunities for students to evaluate what they have learned and apply it in novel circumstances. Clearly, this prescription demands far more than most college and university scientists have been prepared for.

Captivatingly written, interwoven with tantalizing illustrations and historical vignettes ranging from Newton's alchemy to quantum mechanics to the storm surge of Hurricane Sandy, Michael Strevens's wholly original investigation of science asks two fundamental questions: Why is science so powerful? And why did it take so long, two thousand years after the invention of philosophy and mathematics, for the human race to start using science to learn the secrets of nature? The Knowledge Machine's radical answer is that science calls on its practitioners to do something irrational: by willfully ignoring religion, theoretical beauty, and, especially, philosophy--essentially stripping away all previous knowledge--scientists embrace an unnaturally narrow method of inquiry, channeling unprecedented energy into observation and experimentation.Like Yuval Harari's Sapiens or Thomas Kuhn's 1962 classic, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, The Knowledge Machine overturns much of what we thought we knew about the origins of the modern world.

Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of skin cells in today's modern world, most often develops on body exposed to sun light, but it can occur anywhere on the body. Most of the skin cancer at beginning stage is curable. Patient's life can be saving from skin cancer by early & fast detection. Early detection of skin cancer in achievable at beginning stage with the new technology. Biopsy method was used to detect the cancer in the earlier days. During biopsy, it is done by removing small amount of skin tissues and that sample goes to examine under a various laboratories. This method was time consuming and less accurate as after the biopsy the analysis process was lengthy and sometimes wrongly diagnosed. In case if the diagnosis was correct there was the possibility of spreading of diseases to other parts of patient body before treatment. To overcome all the obstructers in the detection the Support vector Machine (SVM) is proposed this is more effective and efficient. This technique has inspired the initial detection of skin cancer and it doesn't require applying oil on the infection skin to achieve clear sharp images of your moles. So this approach is quicker and cleaner.

An authority on creativity introduces us to AI-powered computers that are creating art, literature, and music that may well surpass the creations of humans.Today's computers are composing music that sounds ""more Bach than Bach,"" turning photographs into paintings in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night, and even writing screenplays. But are computers truly creative--or are they merely tools to be used by musicians, artists, and writers? In this book, Arthur I. Miller takes us on a tour of creativity in the age of machines. Miller, an authority on creativity, identifies the key factors essential to the creative process, from ""the need for introspection"" to ""the ability to discover the key problem."" He talks to people on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, encountering computers that mimic the brain and machines that have defeated champions in chess, Jeopardy!, and Go. In the central part of the book, Miller explores the riches of computer-created art, introducing us to artists and computer scientists who have, among much else, unleashed an artificial neural network to create a nightmarish, multi-eyed dog-cat; taught AI to imagine; developed a robot that paints; created algorithms for poetry; and produced the world's first computer-composed musical, Beyond the Fence, staged by Android Lloyd Webber and friends.But, Miller writes, in order to be truly creative, machines will need to step into the world. He probes the nature of consciousness and speaks to researchers trying to develop emotions and consciousness in computers. Miller argues that computers can already be as creative as humans--and someday will surpass us. But this is not a dystopian account; Miller celebrates the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence in art, music, and literature.

In a region where marketing of electricity is being practiced, the supply of electrical energy becomes highly competitive between the supply utilities. Private distribution companies are dedicated to maintaining the quality of supply at an elevated level to consumers, although their primary aim was to run a profitable and successful business through compensation plans to the clients. This book focus on improvement of power factor on inductive loads in machine tools plant. Since most of the electrical loads are inductive in nature and to provide reduction in distribution losses and the electricity bill charges, a form of power factor correction device is employed, usually in the form of capacitors, which draws leading reactive current to neutralize as much of the lagging reactive component of load current as possible. To improve the power factor in machine tools industries, it is required to install capacitors of appropriates ratings as near to the load as possible. This paper presents a case of an induction machine in a factory having a power factor of 0.75 and has capacity of improving its power factor to 0.9 by connecting suitable capacitors in parallel with the inductions motors.

These proof techniques are introduced using the context of number theory. The last chapter uses Calculus as a way for students to apply the proof techniques they have learned.

Trends in Deep Learning Methodologies: Algorithms, Applications, and Systems covers deep learning approaches such as neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, deep auto-encoder, and deep generative networks, which have emerged as powerful computational models. Chapters elaborate on these models which have shown significant success in dealing with massive data for a large number of applications, given their capacity to extract complex hidden features and learn efficient representation in unsupervised settings. Chapters investigate deep learning-based algorithms in a variety of application, including biomedical and health informatics, computer vision, image processing, and more.  In recent years, many powerful algorithms have been developed for matching patterns in data and making predictions about future events. The major advantage of deep learning is to process big data analytics for better analysis and self-adaptive algorithms to handle more data. Deep learning methods can deal with multiple levels of representation in which the system learns to abstract higher level representations of raw data. Earlier, it was a common requirement to have a domain expert to develop a specific model for each specific application, however, recent advancements in representation learning algorithms allow researchers across various subject domains to automatically learn the patterns and representation of the given data for the development of specific models.

Computer vision and machine intelligence paradigms are prominent in the domain of medical image applications, including computer assisted diagnosis, image guided radiation therapy, landmark detection, imaging genomics, and brain connectomics. Medical image analysis and understanding are daunting tasks owing to the massive influx of multi-modal medical image data generated during routine clinal practice. Advanced computer vision and machine intelligence approaches have been employed in recent years in the field of image processing and computer vision. However, due to the unstructured nature of medical imaging data and the volume of data produced during routine clinical processes, the applicability of these meta-heuristic algorithms remains to be investigated. Advanced Machine Vision Paradigms for Medical Image Analysis presents an overview of how medical imaging data can be analyzed to provide better diagnosis and treatment of disease. Computer vision techniques can explore texture, shape, contour and prior knowledge along with contextual information, from image sequence and 3D/4D information which helps with better human understanding. Many powerful tools have been developed through image segmentation, machine learning, pattern classification, tracking, and reconstruction to surface much needed quantitative information not easily available through the analysis of trained human specialists. The aim of the book is for medical imaging professionals to acquire and interpret the data, and for computer vision professionals to learn how to provide enhanced medical information by using computer vision techniques. The ultimate objective is to benefit patients without adding to already high healthcare costs.

The recent success of Reinforcement Learning and related methods can be attributed to several key factors. First, it is driven by reward signals obtained through the interaction with the environment. Second, it is closely related to the human learning behavior. Third, it has a solid mathematical foundation. Nonetheless, conventional Reinforcement Learning theory exhibits some shortcomings particularly in a continuous environment or in considering the stability and robustness of the controlled process. In this monograph, the authors build on Reinforcement Learning to present a learning-based approach for controlling dynamical systems from real-time data and review some major developments in this relatively young field. In doing so the authors develop a framework for learning-based control theory that shows how to learn directly suboptimal controllers from input-output data. There are three main challenges on the development of learning-based control. First, there is a need to generalize existing recursive methods. Second, as a fundamental difference between learning-based control and Reinforcement Learning, stability and robustness are important issues that must be addressed for the safety-critical engineering systems such as self-driving cars. Third, data efficiency of Reinforcement Learning algorithms need be addressed for safety-critical engineering systems. This monograph provides the reader with an accessible primer on a new direction in control theory still in its infancy, namely Learning-Based Control Theory, that is closely tied to the literature of safe Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Dynamic Programming.

This book presents the first English translation of the original French treatise ""La Physique d'Einstein"" written by the young Georges Lemaître in 1922, only six years after the publication of Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity. It includes an historical introduction and a critical edition of the original treatise in French supplemented by the author's own later additions and corrections.  Monsignor Georges Lemaître can be considered the founder of the ""Big Bang Theory"" and a visionary architect of modern Cosmology. The scientific community is only beginning to grasp the full extent of the legacy of this towering figure of 20th century physics. Against the best advice of the greatest names of his time, the young Lemaître was convinced, solely through the study of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, that space and time must have had a beginning with a tremendous ""Big Bang"" from a ""quantum primeval atom"" resulting in an ever-expanding Universe with a positive cosmological constant.  But how did the young Lemaître, essentially on his own, come to grips with the physics of Einstein? A year before his ordination as a diocesan priest, he submitted the audacious treatise, published in this book, that was to earn him Fellowships to study at Cambridge, MIT and Harvard, and launched him on a scientific path of ground-breaking discoveries. Almost a century after Lemaître's seminal publications of 1927 and 1931, this highly pedagogical treatise is still of timely interest to young minds and remains of great value from a history of science perspective.

With many great game writers crediting this as the book that got them started, there still is no better way to learn the language at the heart of the ZX Spectrum.* * *As the original publisher Melbourne House wrote: If you are frustrated by the limitations of BASIC and want to write faster, more powerful, space-saving programs or subroutines, Spectrum Machine Language for the Absolute Beginner is the book for you.Even with no previous experience of computer languages, you will be able to discover the ease and power of the Spectrum's own language. Each chapter includes specific examples of machine language applications which can be demonstrated and used on your Spectrum as well as a self-test questionnaire.At the end of the book, all this is brought together in an entire machine language program - from design right through to the complete listing of an exciting, original arcade game.* * *Acorn Books is proud to present its Retro Reproduction Series, a collection of classic computing works from the 1980s and 90s, lovingly reproduced in the 21st century. From standards of programming reference no self-respecting microcomputer programmer would be without, to obscure works not found in print anywhere else, these modern reprints are perfect for any connoisseur of retro computing.

This book describes deep learning systems: the algorithms, compilers, and processor components to efficiently train and deploy deep learning models for commercial applications. The exponential growth in computational power is slowing at a time when the amount of compute consumed by state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) workloads is rapidly growing. Model size, serving latency, and power constraints are a significant challenge in the deployment of DL models for many applications. Therefore, it is imperative to codesign algorithms, compilers, and hardware to accelerate advances in this field with holistic system-level and algorithm solutions that improve performance, power, and efficiency. Advancing DL systems generally involves three types of engineers: (1) data scientists that utilize and develop DL algorithms in partnership with domain experts, such as medical, economic, or climate scientists; (2) hardware designers that develop specialized hardware to accelerate the components in the DL models; and (3) performance and compiler engineers that optimize software to run more efficiently on a given hardware. Hardware engineers should be aware of the characteristics and components of production and academic models likely to be adopted by industry to guide design decisions impacting future hardware. Data scientists should be aware of deployment platform constraints when designing models. Performance engineers should support optimizations across diverse models, libraries, and hardware targets. The purpose of this book is to provide a solid understanding of (1) the design, training, and applications of DL algorithms in industry; (2) the compiler techniques to map deep learning code to hardware targets; and (3) the critical hardware features that accelerate DL systems. This book aims to facilitate co-innovation for the advancement of DL systems. It is written for engineers working in one or more of these areas who seek to understand the entire system stack in order to better collaborate with engineers working in other parts of the system stack. The book details advancements and adoption of DL models in industry, explains the training and deployment process, describes the essential hardware architectural features needed for today's and future models, and details advances in DL compilers to efficiently execute algorithms across various hardware targets. Unique in this book is the holistic exposition of the entire DL system stack, the emphasis on commercial applications, and the practical techniques to design models and accelerate their performance. The author is fortunate to work with hardware, software, data scientist, and research teams across many high-technology companies with hyperscale data centers. These companies employ many of the examples and methods provided throughout the book.

From the acclaimed author of Tubes, a lively and surprising tour of the infrastructure behind the weather forecast, the people who built it, and what it reveals about our climate and our planetThe weather is the foundation of our daily lives. It's a staple of small talk, the app on our smartphones, and often the first thing we check each morning. Yet behind these quotidian interactions is one of the most expansive machines human beings have ever constructed--a triumph of science, technology and global cooperation. But what is this 'weather machine' and who created it? In The Weather Machine, Andrew Blum takes readers on a fascinating journey through an everyday miracle. In a quest to understand how the forecast works, he visits old weather stations and watches new satellites blast off. He follows the dogged efforts of scientists to create a supercomputer model of the atmosphere and traces the surprising history of the algorithms that power their work. He discovers that we have quietly entered a golden age of meteorology--our tools allow us to predict weather more accurately than ever, and yet we haven't learned to trust them, nor can we guarantee the fragile international alliances that allow our modern weather machine to exist.Written with the sharp wit and infectious curiosity Andrew Blum is known for, The Weather Machine pulls back the curtain on a universal part of our everyday lives, illuminating our relationships with technology, the planet, and the global community.

This book examines the possibility of automating pasture care by fusing conventional technologies with modern sensor technologies, including the accompanying electrification. It subsequently explores the feasibility and benefits of such a system on the basis of a prototype.The overall challenge in fodder production, and in milk and meat production, is to shift the focus away from the economic aspects and toward achieving a better balance with ecological and societal aspects. In the future, pastureland will become an increasingly valuable resource. Good pasture turf is the basis of high grazing performance and an efficient grazing farm; reduced quantity and quality of pasture forage are chiefly due to insufficient pasture care.The prototype developed and discussed here, based on a commercially available remote-controlled mulcher, performs the selective pasture maintenance needed for precision farming. The vehicle has been upgraded with a GPS system for automatic guidance, while a 2D laser scanner is used to localise relevant spots in real-time. The pasture maintenance operations include mulching of un-grazed spots and reseeding of damage done by footsteps. The book presents the results of field tests on effective spot detection and the fuel-saving benefits of selective mulching.

From theory to application, this book presents research on biologically and brain-inspired networking and machine learning based on Yuragi, which is the Japanese term describing the noise or fluctuations that are inherently used to control the dynamics of a system. The Yuragi mechanism can be found in various biological contexts, such as in gene expression dynamics, molecular motors in muscles, or the visual recognition process in the brain. Unlike conventional network protocols that are usually designed to operate under controlled conditions with a predefined set of rules, the probabilistic behavior of Yuragi-based control permits the system to adapt to unknown situations in a distributed and self-organized manner leading to a higher scalability and robustness.The book consists of two parts. Part 1 provides in four chapters an introduction to the biological background of the Yuragi concept as well as how these are applied to networking problems. Part 2 provides additional contributions that extend the original Yuragi concept to a Bayesian attractor model from human perceptual decision making. In the six chapters of the second part, applications to various fields in information network control and artificial intelligence are presented, ranging from virtual network reconfigurations, a software-defined Internet of Things, and low-power wide-area networks.This book will benefit those working in the fields of information networks, distributed systems, and machine learning who seek new design mechanisms for controlling large-scale dynamically changing systems.

Revision with unchanged content. Can machines be taught? If so, what methods are useful for teaching machines? Machine learning is a field focused on systems that can learn through their own experiences and evaluation. Programmers could encode all behaviors for a task, but this process quickly becomes limited to condensed problems. Therefore, scientists have turned to methods with adaptability, ta-king cues from biological systems (including the human brain) to solve more complex problems in varied environments. This book describes two experi-ments implementing supervised reinforcement learning on a real, mobile ro-bot. One tests the robot's reliability in completing a navigation task it has been taught by a supervisor. The other, in which obstacles are placed along the path to the goal, measures the robot's robustness to changes in environ-ment. Experimental analysis answered: How quickly can the robot find the goal? How much reward does the robot amass? How often does the robot fail in the task? How closely does the robot match the supervisor's actions? This book is addressed to those looking for means to teach robots about rewards/punishments, such as researchers in Robotics, Machine Learning, and Engineering.

Revision with unchanged content. Current educational operation for informal science institutions tends to be based on the staff's experience and intuition rather than on educational theories or research findings. This status study sought research evidence to develop an Educational Scheme for informal science institutions. Evidence for this scheme came from surveys to determine specific circumstances of educational operations, visitor behaviors and ethnographical research . The Discrepancy Model seeking gaps between the actual and desired states guided this investigation of how the staff view the nature and status of edu-cational operations. Institutional data were collected as a form of a survey asking about actual and desired states in terms of goals and roles of staff, contents of exhibits and programs, assessment, and professional develop-ment each for administrators and practitioners. Another investigation sought visitors' views of the effectiveness of the main idea for exhibit understanding, effective labels, expectations toward on-site lessons, and possibilities for a long-term assessment. A needed direction was proposed to develop the Scheme.

This book on the teaching and learning of physics is intended for college-level instructors, but high school instructors might also find it very useful.Some ideas found in this book might be a small 'tweak' to existing practices whereas others require more substantial revisions to instruction. The discussions of student learning herein are based on research evidence accumulated over decades from various fields, including cognitive psychology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and discipline-based education research including physics education research. Likewise, the teaching suggestions are also based on research findings. As for any other scientific endeavor, physics education research is an empirical field where experiments are performed, data are analyzed and conclusions drawn. Evidence from such research is then used to inform physics teaching and learning.While the focus here is on introductory physics taken by most students when they are enrolled, however, the ideas can also be used to improve teaching and learning in both upper-division undergraduate physics courses, as well as graduate-level courses. Whether you are new to teaching physics or a seasoned veteran, various ideas and strategies presented in the book will be suitable for active consideration.

Revision with unchanged content. Computer simulations are increasingly recognized as educational tools that facilitate students' learning in a safe environment. However, the way in which the simulations are used can have considerable impact on learning outcomes. Some have argued that exploratory learning is an effective strategy for lear-ning new materials; but others have expressed concern that allowing free ex-ploration may result in less efficient, or even inaccurate, learning and there-fore encourage more guided exploration. The purpose of this work is to com-pare learning outcomes of students using an interactive computer simulation designed to teach fundamentals of oxygenation management under two ex-ploratory learning methods (free versus guided exploration). This book is ad-dressed to health professionals such as nurses and doctors who are planning to use computer simulation in clinical as well as educators using interactive simulations as part of their educational process.

This book provides a step-by-step methodology and derivation of deep learning algorithms as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN), especially for estimating parameters, with back-propagation as well as examples with real datasets of hydrometeorology (e.g. streamflow and temperature) and environmental science (e.g. water quality). Deep learning is known as part of machine learning methodology based on the artificial neural network. Increasing data availability and computing power enhance applications of deep learning to hydrometeorological and environmental fields. However, books that specifically focus on applications to these fields are limited.Most of deep learning books demonstrate theoretical backgrounds and mathematics. However, examples with real data and step-by-step explanations to understand the algorithms in hydrometeorology and environmental science are very rare. This book focuses on the explanation of deep learning techniques and their applications to hydrometeorological and environmental studies with real hydrological and environmental data. This book covers the major deep learning algorithms as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as well as the conventional artificial neural network model.

Deep Learning is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. In practical terms, deep learning is just a subset of machine learning. It technically is machine learning and functions in a similar way (hence why the terms are sometimes loosely interchanged), but its capabilities are different. Basic machine learning models do become progressively better at whatever their function is, but they still need some guidance. If an ML algorithm returns an inaccurate prediction, then an engineer needs to step in and make adjustments. But with a deep learning model, the algorithms can determine on their own if a prediction is accurate or not. A deep learning model is able to learn through its own method of computing -its own― brain.

For Readers of Ray Kurzweil and Michio Kaku, a New Look at the Cutting Edge of Artificial Intelligence  Imagine a robotic stuffed animal that can read and respond to a child's emotional state, a commercial that can recognize and change based on a customer's facial expression, or a company that can actually create feelings as though a person were experiencing them naturally. Heart of the Machine explores the next giant step in the relationship between humans and technology: the ability of computers to recognize, respond to, and even replicate emotions. Computers have long been integral to our lives, and their advances continue at an exponential rate. Many believe that artificial intelligence equal or superior to human intelligence will happen in the not-too-distance future; some even think machine consciousness will follow. Futurist Richard Yonck argues that emotion, the first, most basic, and most natural form of communication, is at the heart of how we will soon work with and use computers.  Instilling emotions into computers is the next leap in our centuries-old obsession with creating machines that replicate humans. But for every benefit this progress may bring to our lives, there is a possible pitfall. Emotion recognition could lead to advanced surveillance, and the same technology that can manipulate our feelings could become a method of mass control. And, as shown in movies like Her and Ex Machina, our society already holds a deep-seated anxiety about what might happen if machines could actually feel and break free from our control. Heart of the Machine is an exploration of the new and inevitable ways in which mankind and technology will interact. The paperback edition has a new foreword by Rana el Kaliouby, PhD, a pioneer in artificial emotional intelligence, as well as the cofounder and CEO of Affectiva, the acclaimed AI startup spun off from the MIT Media Lab.

This book is a foundational guide to graph representation learning, including state-of-the art advances, and introduces the highly successful graph neural network (GNN) formalism. Graph-structured data is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social sciences, from telecommunication networks to quantum chemistry. Building relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures is crucial for creating systems that can learn, reason, and generalize from this kind of data. Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representation learning, including techniques for deep graph embeddings, generalizations of convolutional neural networks to graph-structured data, and neural message-passing approaches inspired by belief propagation. These advances in graph representation learning have led to new state-of-the-art results in numerous domains, including chemical synthesis, 3D vision, recommender systems, question answering, and social network analysis. It begins with a discussion of the goals of graph representation learning as well as key methodological foundations in graph theory and network analysis. Following this, the book introduces and reviews methods for learning node embeddings, including random-walk-based methods and applications to knowledge graphs. It then provides a technical synthesis and introduction to the highly successful graph neural network (GNN) formalism, which has become a dominant and fast-growing paradigm for deep learning with graph data. The book concludes with a synthesis of recent advancements in deep generative models for graphs -- a nascent but quickly growing subset of graph representation learning.

Deep Learning (DL) is a method of machine learning, running over Artificial Neural Networks, that uses multiple layers to extract high-level features from large amounts of raw data. Deep Learning methods apply levels of learning to transform input data into more abstract and composite information. Handbook of Deep Learning in Biomedical Engineering gives readers a complete overview of the essential concepts of Deep Learning and its applications in the field of Biomedical Engineering. Deep learning has been rapidly developed in recent years, in terms of both methodological constructs and practical applications. Deep Learning provides computational models of multiple processing layers to learn and represent data with higher levels of abstraction. It is able to implicitly capture intricate structures of large-scale data and is ideally suited to many of the hardware architectures that are currently available. The ever-expanding amount of data that can be gathered through biomedical and clinical information sensing devices necessitates the development of machine learning and AI techniques such as Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks to process and evaluate the data. Some examples of biomedical and clinical sensing devices that use Deep Learning include: Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Particle Imaging, EE/MEG, Optical Microscopy and Tomography, Photoacoustic Tomography, Electron Tomography, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Handbook of Deep Learning in Biomedical Engineering provides the most complete coverage of Deep Learning applications in biomedical engineering available, including detailed real-world applications in areas such as computational neuroscience, neuroimaging, data fusion, medical image processing, neurological disorder diagnosis for diseases such as Alzheimer's, ADHD, and ASD, tumor prediction, as well as translational multimodal imaging analysis.

Revision with unchanged content. FLUX is a programming system for reasoning agents based on the fluent calculus. FLUX agents maintain an internal model of their environment, enabling them to represent partial knowledge. This ability gives rise to powerful reasoning techniques such as planning. Conventionally, the strategy such an agents executes in order to achieve a certain goal is static and needs to be defined in advance. Agents which are able to derive a strategy on their own, using experience and domain knowledge, can provide a way to tackle real world problems that change unexpectedly or for which no solution is known in advance. In this work, we focus on learning a strategy able to use the reasoning capabilities offered by systems such as FLUX. We present a technique to decompose a problem into smaller subproblems using heuristics derived from a given domain description. On this basis, subprograms are learnt in different hypothesis spaces, which correspond to different reasoning techniques. With the help of a grammar inducer, an inductive inference machine composes the found subprograms into the final strategy. The application of this work is still restricted to scenarios where a simulator is available.

Many relationships among data in several areas (such as computer vision, molecular chemistry and pattern recognition) can be represented by graphs. In the machine learning setting, it is an important learning task to classify graph-structural data correctly. Typically, the established techniques for this setting proceed via graph kernels and neural-network classification. In this work, we explore end-to-end learning for graphs: the objective is to operate on the graph representations directly. The key idea of our approach is to use standard tools for graph canonization. We test the performance of this approach on several datasets arising from bioinformatics. In general, we find that the graph canonization, as such, does not improve the accuracy of the classification. A possible reason for this behavior is that the neural network ends up overfitting to the given adjacency matrix representation.

Furthermore, evaluating existing e-learning initiatives and determining critical success factors for quality has been lacking. This has called for further investigation into e-learning practices in order to fill the gaps identified. The study presents a model for evaluating e-learning system quality through modifying and extending the Biggs Framework for Quality Learning with other models and frameworks. A descriptive and exploratory research using a cross-sectional survey of 180 respondents from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture & Technology (JKUAT) was used. Data was collected via Questionnaire and Interviews with a stratified sampling technique.

This is Part III of my winning games against the top engines. This part features handicap wins. Most handicaps consist of 1 or 2 pawns material on average, factoring in relevant positional terms too. Though, that size of material advantage would include the widest selection of different start positions. Handicap games are definitely the most fun, especially to play, but I guess also to follow, as they feature imbalanced, tactically rich play, from the very first moves. For precisely the same reason, they are very good for training your tactics. Most of the credit for this volume goes to GM Larry Kaufman of the Komodo team. Whenever Komodo would play a match against some human, and Larry would post about the match on Talkchess forum, I would try my hand with the very same handicaps against the top engines. As said, handicap games are one of the greatest fun events possible in chess, so don't miss this book. Lyudmil Tsvetkov is a political scientist, former career diplomat, Bulgarian candidate master of chess since 1998 and one of the main Stockfish contributors. In the last 5 years, he has completely focused on chess analysis and the investigation of the deeper sides of chess knowledge.

Though in the past online learning was considered of poorer professional quality than classroom learning, it has become a useful and, in some cases, vital tool for promoting the inclusivity of education. Some of its benefits include allowing greater accessibility to educational resources previously unattainable by those in rural areas, and in current times, it has proven to be a critical asset as universities shut down due to natural disasters and pandemics. Examining the current state of distance learning and determining online assessment tools and processes that can enhance the online learning experience are clearly crucial for the advancement of modern education. The Handbook of Research on Determining the Reliability of Online Assessment and Distance Learning is a collection of pioneering investigations on the methods and applications of digital technologies in the realm of education. It provides a clear and extensive analysis of issues regarding online learning while also offering frameworks to solve these addressed problems. Moreover, the book reviews and evaluates the present and intended future of distance learning, focusing on the societal and employer perspective versus the academic proposals.

Deep Learning which comprises Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has achieved excellent success in image classification, speech recognition, etc. But DNNs suffer a lot of challenges for time series forecasting (TSF) because most of the time-series data are nonlinear in nature and highly dynamic in behavior. TSF has a great impact on our socio-economic environment. Hence, to deal with these challenges the DNN model needs to be redefined, and keeping this in mind, data pre-processing, network architecture and network parameters are needed to be considered before feeding the data into DNN models. Data normalization is the basic data pre-processing technique form which learning is to be done. The effectiveness of TSF heavily depends on the data normalization technique. In this Book, different normalization methods are used on time series data before feeding the data into the DNN model and we try to find out the impact of each normalization technique on DNN for TSF. We also propose the Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) to predict the closing index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by using time series data.

Distance Education (EaD) has consolidated itself as an important modality of the educational system. Flexible, scalable and with a relatively low cost of implementation, EaD allows reaching distant locations, realizing the right to education for thousands of citizens marginalized by the absence of the State. It is a fact, however, that education must respect the individuality of the student, and it is not possible to think in terms of a merely massified educational process. In this sense, learning analysis (LA) and the mining of educational data present themselves as relevant methods of extraction and analysis of data from the teaching-learning process carried out in Virtual Learning Environments (AVA). Such methods are shown to be capable of acting in Big Data scenarios and therefore capable of conceiving and underpin initiatives to customize and adapt the teaching process.

Revision with unchanged content. In the last years, the Web has become an invaluable source of information for almost every domain of knowledge. This has motivated researchers to considering the Web as a valid repository for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition. In this sense, Ontology Learning from web resources is a particularly interesting topic as Ontologies are required to achieve interoperability and information understanding in knowledge intensive environments such as the Semantic Web. This book analyzes the ontology construction process from the automatic learning point of view. It presents a novel approach for Ontology Learning, introducing new methods for knowledge acquisition from the Web. The adaptation of several learning techniques to the web corpus and the exploitation of particular characteristics of the Web environment composing an automatic, un-supervised and domain independent approach distinguishes the present proposal from previous works. The discussion, methods and results presented in this work should help researchers interested in taking profit from the information available in the Web and to create a consistent base of ontologies required for the Semantic Web.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site.The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal deﬁnition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's ﬂavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index. The Glossary is also worth going through. This fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time.

The idea for this book came about as a result of the ICT Guides project, which was funded by the Erasmus+ programme . The project was carried out in 2015-2018 in Gothenburg (Sweden), Berlin (Germany), Madrid (Spain) and Sheffield (United Kingdom). The cities identified for the project all have a relatively high percentage of young school students with immigrant backgrounds. This group of Europeans in particular are at risk of early school leaving, and are over-represented in terms of unemployment. The book addresses the issue of information and communication technology (ICT) use in an educational environment, and presents research results from the ICT Guides project. In order to discuss how ICT can be used as a means to prevent early school leaving among immigrant youth, this book explores the literature on how learning can be understood in the intergenerational context (Chapter 1); what the challenges are in preventing early school leaving (Chapter 2), and the prospects for ICT in education (Chapter 3). Finally, we present the findings of an empirical study on intergenerational learning with the use of information and communications technology (Chapter 4). As reports on youth in Europe show, young immigrants are most at risk of social exclusion. Employment is a strong protective factor against the risk of poverty, and - as identified in the EU 2020 strategy - one of the most important targets for a smart, sustainable and inclusive Europe. Immigrant youths suffer from having an incomplete education, partly because of the economic crisis in Europe, and partly because of the military conflicts and strife in places such as Syria and Afghanistan. Our findings highlight the fact that ICT-supported learning is a significant sociocultural platform for knowledge exchange, at the same time reducing intergenerational and cultural distance. It helps work toward the common good, creates a sense of belonging and ensures mutual support, and encourages better understanding and harmonious coexistence between young immigrants and older citizens. The function of ICT in intergenerational learning is changing, from serving as its catalyst to facilitating its participants' learning about each other.

Revision with unchanged content. Reinforcement learning is an area of artificial intelligence that studies the ability of autonomous agents to improve their behavior in the absence of an informed instructor. Although reinforcement learning has achieved success in a wide range of applications, it becomes less consistent as the size of a task grows. This book attempts to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning in realistic tasks by identifying a certain type of task structure. A task that displays this type of structure can be decomposed into a hierarchy of subtasks. Each subtask can be simplified using state abstraction so that it is much easier to solve than the original task. Reinforcement learning can be applied to produce solutions to the subtasks, and the solutions can be combined to achieve a solution to the original task. Experimental results indicate that hierarchical decomposition combined with state abstraction can significantly simplify the solution of realistic tasks. The book thus contributes to increasing the potential of reinforcement learning in realistic tasks. The book is directed towards researchers in Artificial Intelligence, but can also be used as a reference by professionals in Robotics and Autonomous Control Engineering.

This Synthesis Lecture focuses on techniques for efficient data orchestration within DNN accelerators. The End of Moore's Law, coupled with the increasing growth in deep learning and other AI applications has led to the emergence of custom Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators for energy-efficient inference on edge devices. Modern DNNs have millions of hyper parameters and involve billions of computations; this necessitates extensive data movement from memory to on-chip processing engines. It is well known that the cost of data movement today surpasses the cost of the actual computation; therefore, DNN accelerators require careful orchestration of data across on-chip compute, network, and memory elements to minimize the number of accesses to external DRAM. The book covers DNN dataflows, data reuse, buffer hierarchies, networks-on-chip, and automated design-space exploration. It concludes with data orchestration challenges with compressed and sparse DNNs and future trends. The target audience is students, engineers, and researchers interested in designing high-performance and low-energy accelerators for DNN inference.

Visionary designer and technologist John Maeda defines the fundamental laws of how computers think, and why you should care even if you aren't a programmer. Maeda is to design what Warren Buffett is to finance. --Wired John Maeda is one of the world's preeminent interdisciplinary thinkers on technology and design. In How to Speak Machine, he offers a set of simple laws that govern not only the computers of today, but the unimaginable machines of the future. Technology is already more powerful than we can comprehend, and getting more powerful at an exponential pace. Once set in motion, algorithms never tire. And when a program's size, speed, and tirelessness combine with its ability to learn and transform itself, the outcome can be unpredictable and dangerous. Take the seemingly instant transformation of Microsoft's chatbot Tay into a hate-spewing racist, or how crime-predicting algorithms reinforce racial bias. How to Speak Machine provides a coherent framework for today's product designers, business leaders, and policymakers to grasp this brave new world. Drawing on his wide-ranging experience from engineering to computer science to design, Maeda shows how businesses and individuals can identify opportunities afforded by technology to make world-changing and inclusive products--while avoiding the pitfalls inherent to the medium.

This book on the teaching and learning of physics is intended for college-level instructors, but high school instructors might also find it very useful.Some ideas found in this book might be a small 'tweak' to existing practices whereas others require more substantial revisions to instruction. The discussions of student learning herein are based on research evidence accumulated over decades from various fields, including cognitive psychology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and discipline-based education research including physics education research. Likewise, the teaching suggestions are also based on research findings. As for any other scientific endeavor, physics education research is an empirical field where experiments are performed, data are analyzed and conclusions drawn. Evidence from such research is then used to inform physics teaching and learning.While the focus here is on introductory physics taken by most students when they are enrolled, however, the ideas can also be used to improve teaching and learning in both upper-division undergraduate physics courses, as well as graduate-level courses. Whether you are new to teaching physics or a seasoned veteran, various ideas and strategies presented in the book will be suitable for active consideration.

The Quantum Internet Machine is a new book that proposes the numerical processes of the quantum internet, and the way to restructure our data and platforms to obey String Theory.The incompleteness of mathematics(the very reason there is no unified theory of the four forces of Nature) is a fact of life but we can handpick what is called the number M; as the next best candidate for the laws of physics. Actually; the numerology in the book is so much like String Theory it extends Ed Witten's M-theory.The protagonist of the book is called the Worst Networker; in conflict with the Full Deck which is the repeatable ordered chaos that can disrupt any form of non randomness, to counter extremists like a statistician would deal with outliers.In philosophy we seek out an ultimate reason for everything but the Quantum Internet Machine, the namesake of the book, is the physical strategy that makes up for the time and money wasted on previous and currently proposed meanings of life. We achieve this by not asking ""why the world is the way it is"" but by summizing and doing what we should; under the circumstances.In politics and business the Quantum Internet Machine crosschecks world leaders; so fintech designers are compelled to include the Full Deck in portfolios. And in the last chapter cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology is discusssed in terms of the number M.Note: Since 2009 the newly discovered (String Theory derived) number 2.717376 ? 1068 is simply called M; like Euler's number 2.718281 is called e.

Biometrics, such as fingerprint, iris, face, hand print, hand vein, speech and gait recognition, etc., as a means of identity management have become commonplace nowadays for various applications. Biometric systems follow a typical pipeline, that is composed of separate preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Deep learning as a data-driven representation learning approach has been shown to be a promising alternative to conventional data-agnostic and handcrafted pre-processing and feature extraction for biometric systems. Furthermore, deep learning offers an end-to-end learning paradigm to unify preprocessing, feature extraction, and recognition, based solely on biometric data. This Special Issue has collected 12 high-quality, state-of-the-art research papers that deal with challenging issues in advanced biometric systems based on deep learning. The 12 papers can be divided into 4 categories according to biometric modality; namely, face biometrics, medical electronic signals (EEG and ECG), voice print, and others.

In the 1980s, private cars began to appear in China, and car ownership continued to grow with the increase of national income. By 2017, the number of private cars in China has reached a staggering 180 million. With the increasing number of cars, people travel more convenient. However, the increase of the number of cars has also led to a series of problems, such as environmental pollution, traffic safety, traffic jam and so on. Among them, most of the accidents relate to the driver. In order to improve the safety of driving, people began to imagine whether the vehicle can drive independently without relying on the driver. In the above background, the focus of this topic is the autonomous driving lateral control, and some research has been carried out.

Physics World Book of the Year A Financial Times, Sunday Times, and Telegraph Best Science Book of the Year What is life? For generations, scientists have struggled to make sense of this fundamental question, for life really does look like magic: even a humble bacterium accomplishes things so dazzling that no human engineer can match it. Huge advances in molecular biology over the past few decades have served only to deepen the mystery. In this penetrating and wide-ranging book, world-renowned physicist and science communicator Paul Davies searches for answers in a field so new and fast-moving that it lacks a name; it is a domain where biology, computing, logic, chemistry, quantum physics, and nanotechnology intersect. At the heart of these diverse fields, Davies explains, is the concept of information: a quantity which has the power to unify biology with physics, transform technology and medicine, and force us to fundamentally reconsider what it means to be alive--even illuminating the age-old question of whether we are alone in the universe. From life's murky origins to the microscopic engines that run the cells of our bodies, The Demon in the Machine journeys across an astounding landscape of cutting-edge science. Weaving together cancer and consciousness, two-headed worms and bird navigation, Davies reveals how biological organisms garner and process information to conjure order out of chaos, opening a window onto the secret of life itself.

The proprietary control of CNC machines results in the inability to control and enhance inputs because the program codes cannot be modified owing to their distribution by vendors in the compiled form. In this book, we present a method to utilize a GRBL-Arduino based controller to run a simple two-axis computerized numerical control (CNC) machine. G-code file is generated by the CAD/CAM software application UG NX for any desired profile. The G-code file generated is given as input to the GRBL-Arduino based controller using the Java-based Windows application Universal GcodeSender (UGS). UGS is linked to the Arduino Uno and GRBL shield V5 hardware via a serial communication port. G-code program is executed through UGS to run two 2.6 kg-cm stepper motors for motion along x and y-axis direction via drivers incorporated on the GRBL-Arduino controller. These stepper motors are a part of a simple two-axis CNC machine comprising aluminum angle brackets, chromed chords, linear motion bearings, a timing belt, and a timing pulley. Stepper motors cause motion of the mentioned mechanical components to draw desired profile.

A great deal of research in the field of education has placed the emphasis on the analysis of learning as strictly cognitive. Particularly in the area of mathematics as a science in which only intellectual effort is involved. It has been until relatively recently that the interest in a different area and in fact considered diametrically opposite: affection, arises in the investigation. This is perhaps explained by the lack of a theoretical framework and an adequate methodology to measure affections. At present, more and more researchers in mathematics have paid attention to affective issues, and both their theoretical frameworks and their tools for obtaining data are increasingly solid and varied. In this paper we intend to present an overview of these investigations, giving an account of several theories that support the relationship between the affective domain and the cognitive domain, specifically associated with the concurrence of emotions in the learning of mathematics. This research is of a descriptive character with mixed methodology, and aims to contribute in the field of the affective domain considering the emotions in relation to basic mathematical competences.

This book sets out the necessary processes and challenges involved in modeling student thinking, understanding and learning. The chapters look at the centrality of models for knowledge claims in science education and explore the modeling of mental processes, knowledge, cognitive development and conceptual learning. The conclusion outlines significant implications for science teachers and those researching in this field.This highly useful work provides models of scientific thinking from different field and analyses the processes by which we can arrive at claims about the minds of others. The author highlights the logical impossibility of ever knowing for sure what someone else knows, understands or thinks, and makes the case that researchers in science education need to be much more explicit about the extent to which research onto learners' ideas in science is necessarily a process of developing models.Through this book we learn that research reports should acknowledge the role of modeling and avoid making claims that are much less tentative than is justified as this can lead to misleading and sometimes contrary findings in the literature. In everyday life we commonly take it for granted that finding out what another knows or thinks is a relatively trivial or straightforward process. We come to take the 'mental register' (the way we talk about the 'contents' of minds) for granted and so teachers and researchers may readily underestimate the challenges involved in their work.

When something works well, you can feel it; there is a sense of rightness to it. We call that rightness beauty, and it ought to be the single most important component of design.This recognition is at the heart of David Gelernter's witty argued essay, Machine Beauty, which defines beauty as an inspired mating of simplicity and power. You can see it in a Bauhaus chair, the Hoover Dam, or an Emerson radio circa 1930. In contrast, too many contemporary technologists run out of ideas and resort to gimmicks and features; they are rarely capable of real, structural ingenuity.Nowhere is this more evident than in the world of computers. You don't have to look far to see how oblivious most computer technologists are to the idea of beauty. Just look at how ugly your computer cabinet is, how unwieldy and out of sync it feels with the manner and speed with which you process thought.The best designers, however, are obsessed with beauty. Both hardware and software should afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve deep beauty, the kind of beauty that happens when many types of loveliness reinforce one another, when design expresses an underlying technology, a machine logic. Program software ought to be transparent; it should engage what Gelernter calls ""a thought-amplifying feedback loop,"" a creative symbiosis with its user. These principles, beautiful in themselves, will set the stage for the next technological revolution, in which the pursuit of elegance will lead to extraordinary innovations.Machine Beauty will delight Gelernter's growing audience, fans of his provocative and biting journalism. Anyone who manufactures, designs, or uses computers will be galvanized by his cogent arguments and tantalizing glimpse of a bright future, where beautiful technology abounds.

Matching, which is to measure the relevance of a document to a query or interest of a user to an item, is a key problem in both search and recommendation. Machine learning has been exploited to address the problem and efforts have been made to develop deep learning techniques for matching tasks in search and recommendation. With the availability of a large amount of data, powerful computational resources, and advanced deep learning techniques, deep learning for matching now becomes the state-of-the-art technology for search and recommendation.The key to the success of the deep learning approach is its strong ability in learning of representations and generalization of matching patterns from data. This survey gives a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the deep matching models for search and recommendation. First, it gives a unified view of matching in search and recommendation and the solutions from the two fields can be compared in one framework. Then, the survey categorizes the current deep learning solutions into two types: methods of representation learning and methods of matching function learning. The fundamental problems as well as the state-of-the-art solutions of query-document matching in search and user-item matching in recommendation are described.Deep Learning for Matching in Search and Recommendation aims to help researchers from both search and recommendation communities to get an in-depth understanding and insight into the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote developments of new technologies. As matching is not limited to search and recommendation, the technologies introduced here can be generalized into a more general task of matching between objects from two spaces.

Philipp Melzer analyses influence factors of personalised learning aiming to lay out design principles for personalised blended learning courses. Finding only weak support for a matching between learning styles and teaching methods, he defines learning tasks as the object of further investigations. Following the idea of a community of inquiry, the author develops the Personalised Learning Framework (PLF), modelling personalised learning as a process of selection as well as usage of learning tasks and learning tools by the community of inquiry. To evaluate the PLF further, a traditional university course is transformed to a personalised flipped classroom course. He shows how personalised learning can be supported in concrete learning interventions using specific learning methods and technologies.

Every age has characteristic inventions that change the world. In the 19th century it was the steam engine and the train. For the 20th, electric and gasoline power, aircraft, nuclear weapons, even ventures into space. Today, the planet is awash with electronic business, chatter and virtual-reality entertainment so brilliant that the division between real and simulated is hard to discern. But one new idea from the 19th century has failed, so far, to enter reality--time travel, using machines to turn the time dimension into a two-way highway. Will it come true, as foreseen in science fiction? Might we expect visits to and from the future, sooner than from space? That is the Time Machine Hypothesis, examined here by futurist Damien Broderick, an award-winning writer and theorist of the genre of the future. Broderick homes in on the topic through the lens of science as well as fiction, exploring some fifty different time-travel scenarios and conundrums found in the science fiction literature and film.

From the acclaimed author of Tubes, a lively and surprising tour of the infrastructure behind the weather forecast, the people who built it, and what it reveals about our climate and our planetThe weather is the foundation of our daily lives. It's a staple of small talk, the app on our smartphones, and often the first thing we check each morning. Yet behind these quotidian interactions is one of the most expansive machines human beings have ever constructed--a triumph of science, technology and global cooperation. But what is this 'weather machine' and who created it? In The Weather Machine, Andrew Blum takes readers on a fascinating journey through an everyday miracle. In a quest to understand how the forecast works, he visits old weather stations and watches new satellites blast off. He follows the dogged efforts of scientists to create a supercomputer model of the atmosphere and traces the surprising history of the algorithms that power their work. He discovers that we have quietly entered a golden age of meteorology--our tools allow us to predict weather more accurately than ever, and yet we haven't learned to trust them, nor can we guarantee the fragile international alliances that allow our modern weather machine to exist.Written with the sharp wit and infectious curiosity Andrew Blum is known for, The Weather Machine pulls back the curtain on a universal part of our everyday lives, illuminating our relationships with technology, the planet, and the global community.

We live in a world increasingly ruled by technology; we seem as governed by technology as we do by laws and regulations. Frighteningly often, the influence of technology in and on our lives goes completely unchallenged by citizens and governments. We comfort ourselves with the soothing refrain that technology has no morals and can display no prejudice, and it's only the users of technology who distort certain aspects of it. But is this statement actually true? Dr Robert Smith thinks it is dangerously untrue in the modern era. Having worked in the field of artificial intelligence for over 30 years, Smith reveals the mounting evidence that the mechanical actors in our lives do indeed have, or at least express, morals: they're just not the morals of the progressive modern society that we imagined we were moving towards. Instead, as we are just beginning to see - in the US elections and Brexit to name but a few - there are increasing incidences of machine bigotry, greed and the crass manipulation of our basest instincts. It is easy to assume that these are the result of programmer prejudices or the product of dark forces manipulating the masses through the network of the Internet. But what if there is something more fundamental and explicitly mechanical at play, something inherent within technology itself? This book demonstrates how non-scientific ideas have been encoded deep into our technological infrastructure. Offering a rigorous, fresh perspective on how technology has brought us to this place, Rage Inside the Machine challenges the long-held assumption that technology is an apolitical and amoral force. Shedding light on little-known historical stories and investigating the complex connections between scientific philosophy, institutional prejudice and new technology, this book offers a new, honest and more truly scientific vision of ourselves.

A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about the potential dangers of superintelligent machines--those that will far surpass the intelligence of even the brightest and most gifted human minds. These machines are expected to emerge in the next couple of decades, yet experts are far from reaching a consensus on the conditions that will catalyze their emergence. Nor are there any plausible theories on how the machines will begin to impact humanity. With Dear Machine, Kieser endeavors to fill this gap by hypothesizing about how superintelligent entities will emerge, what perspectives they will hold on society's most vexing problems and how they will begin impacting humanity. He lays the groundwork for his arguments by providing important context that is currently missing from discourse on the subject: a survey of humanity's historical relationship with the natural world and each other over the past 70,000 years and a discussion of the cognitive impediments that have historically driven humanity to disharmonious ends--and continue to do so today. Kieser's vision is breathtakingly optimistic, eco-futuristic, infinitely holistic and, at times, scary.

Text production has many applications. It is used, for instance, to generate dialogue turns from dialogue moves, verbalise the content of knowledge bases, or generate English sentences from rich linguistic representations, such as dependency trees or abstract meaning representations. Text production is also at work in text-to-text transformations such as sentence compression, sentence fusion, paraphrasing, sentence (or text) simplification, and text summarisation. This book offers an overview of the fundamentals of neural models for text production. In particular, we elaborate on three main aspects of neural approaches to text production: how sequential decoders learn to generate adequate text, how encoders learn to produce better input representations, and how neural generators account for task-specific objectives. Indeed, each text-production task raises a slightly different challenge (e.g, how to take the dialogue context into account when producing a dialogue turn, how to detect and merge relevant information when summarising a text, or how to produce a well-formed text that correctly captures the information contained in some input data in the case of data-to-text generation). We outline the constraints specific to some of these tasks and examine how existing neural models account for them. More generally, this book considers text-to-text, meaning-to-text, and data-to-text transformations. It aims to provide the audience with a basic knowledge of neural approaches to text production and a roadmap to get them started with the related work. The book is mainly targeted at researchers, graduate students, and industrials interested in text production from different forms of inputs.

These proceedings showcase the best papers selected from more than 500 submissions, introducing readers to the top research topics and the latest developmental trends in the theory and application of Man-Machine-Environment System Engineering (MMESE). This research topic was first established in China by Professor Shengzhao Long in 1981, with direct support from one of the greatest modern Chinese scientists, Xuesen Qian. In a letter to Shengzhao Long from October 22nd, 1993, Xuesen Qian wrote: ""You have created a very important modern science and technology in China!"" MMESE primarily focuses on the relationship between Man, Machine and Environment, studying the optimum combination of related Man-Machine-Environment systems. In this paradigm, ""Man"" refers to working people as the subject at the workplace (e.g. operators, decision-makers); ""Machine"" is the general name for any object controlled by Man (including tools, machinery, computers, systems and technologies), and ""Environment"" describes the specific working conditions under which Man and Machine interact (e.g. temperature, noise, vibration, hazardous gases etc.). In turn, the three goals of optimization are to ensure safety, efficiency and economy in this context. These proceedings present interdisciplinary studies on the concepts and methods of physiology, psychology, system engineering, computer science, environmental science, management, education, and other related disciplines. They offer a valuable resource for all researchers and professionals whose work involves interdisciplinary areas touching on MMESE subjects.

The genesis of the digital idea and why it transformed civilizationA few short decades ago, we were informed by the smooth signals of analog television and radio; we communicated using our analog telephones; and we even computed with analog computers. Today our world is digital, built with zeros and ones. Why did this revolution occur? The Discrete Charm of the Machine explains, in an engaging and accessible manner, the varied physical and logical reasons behind this radical transformation.The spark of individual genius shines through this story of innovation: the stored program of Jacquard's loom; Charles Babbage's logical branching; Alan Turing's brilliant abstraction of the discrete machine; Harry Nyquist's foundation for digital signal processing; Claude Shannon's breakthrough insights into the meaning of information and bandwidth; and Richard Feynman's prescient proposals for nanotechnology and quantum computing. Ken Steiglitz follows the progression of these ideas in the building of our digital world, from the internet and artificial intelligence to the edge of the unknown. Are questions like the famous traveling salesman problem truly beyond the reach of ordinary digital computers? Can quantum computers transcend these barriers? Does a mysterious magical power reside in the analog mechanisms of the brain? Steiglitz concludes by confronting the moral and aesthetic questions raised by the development of artificial intelligence and autonomous robots.The Discrete Charm of the Machine examines why our information technology, the lifeblood of our civilization, became digital, and challenges us to think about where its future trajectory may lead.

AI is radically transforming business. Are you ready?Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that ""think"" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow fast. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead. Those that neglect it will fall behind. Which side are you on?In Human + Machine, Accenture leaders Paul R. Daugherty and H. James (Jim) Wilson show that the essence of the AI paradigm shift is the transformation of all business processes within an organization--whether related to breakthrough innovation, everyday customer service, or personal productivity habits. As humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling companies to change them on the fly--or to completely reimagine them. AI is changing all the rules of how companies operate.Based on the authors' experience and research with 1,500 organizations, the book reveals how companies are using the new rules of AI to leap ahead on innovation and profitability, as well as what you can do to achieve similar results. It describes six entirely new types of hybrid human + machine roles that every company must develop, and it includes a ""leader's guide"" with the five crucial principles required to become an AI-fueled business.Human + Machine provides the missing and much-needed management playbook for success in our new age of AI.BOOK PROCEEDS FOR THE AI GENERATIONThe authors' goal in publishing Human + Machine is to help executives, workers, students and others navigate the changes that AI is making to business and the economy. They believe AI will bring innovations that truly improve the way the world works and lives. However, AI will cause disruption, and many people will need education, training and support to prepare for the newly created jobs. To support this need, the authors are donating the royalties received from the sale of this book to fund education and retraining programs focused on developing fusion skills for the age of artificial intelligence.

This book assembles recent research on memory and learning in plants. Organisms that share a capability to store information about experiences in the past have an actively generated background resource on which they can compare and evaluate coming experiences in order to react faster or even better. This is an essential tool for all adaptation purposes. Such memory/learning skills can be found from bacteria up to fungi, animals and plants, although until recently it had been mentioned only as capabilities of higher animals. With the rise of epigenetics the context dependent marking of experiences on the genetic level is an essential perspective to understand memory and learning in organisms. Plants are highly sensitive organisms that actively compete for environmental resources. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realize the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self'. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behavior accordingly. The book will guide scientists in further investigations on these skills of plant behavior and on how plants mediate signaling processes between themselves and the environment in memory and learning processes.

This book not only discusses the important topics in the area of machine learning and combinatorial optimization, it also combines them into one. This was decisive for choosing the material to be included in the book and determining its order of presentation. Decision trees are a popular method of classification as well as of knowledge representation. At the same time, they are easy to implement as the building blocks of an ensemble of classifiers. Admittedly, however, the task of constructing a near-optimal decision tree is a very complex process. The good results typically achieved by the ant colony optimization algorithms when dealing with combinatorial optimization problems suggest the possibility of also using that approach for effectively constructing decision trees. The underlying rationale is that both problem classes can be presented as graphs. This fact leads to option of considering a larger spectrum of solutions than those based on the heuristic. Moreover, ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to advantage when building ensembles of classifiers.This book is a combination of a research monograph and a textbook. It can be used in graduate courses, but is also of interest to researchers, both specialists in machine learning and those applying machine learning methods to cope with problems from any field of R&D.

In Your Brain Is a Time Machine, leading neuroscientist Dean Buonomano embarks on an ""immensely engaging"" exploration of how time works inside the brain (Barbara Kiser, Nature). The human brain, he argues, is a complex system that not only tells time, but creates it; it constructs our sense of chronological movement and enables ""mental time travel""--simulations of future and past events. These functions are essential not only to our daily lives but to the evolution of the human race: without the ability to anticipate the future, mankind would never have crafted tools or invented agriculture. This virtuosic work of popular science will lead you to a revelation as strange as it is true: your brain is, at its core, a time machine.

A concise, nontechnical overview of the development of machine translation, including the different approaches, evaluation issues, and major players in the industry.The dream of a universal translation device goes back many decades, long before Douglas Adams's fictional Babel fish provided this service in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since the advent of computers, research has focused on the design of digital machine translation tools--computer programs capable of automatically translating a text from a source language to a target language. This has become one of the most fundamental tasks of artificial intelligence. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise, nontechnical overview of the development of machine translation, including the different approaches, evaluation issues, and market potential. The main approaches are presented from a largely historical perspective and in an intuitive manner, allowing the reader to understand the main principles without knowing the mathematical details. The book begins by discussing problems that must be solved during the development of a machine translation system and offering a brief overview of the evolution of the field. It then takes up the history of machine translation in more detail, describing its pre-digital beginnings, rule-based approaches, the 1966 ALPAC (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee) report and its consequences, the advent of parallel corpora, the example-based paradigm, the statistical paradigm, the segment-based approach, the introduction of more linguistic knowledge into the systems, and the latest approaches based on deep learning. Finally, it considers evaluation challenges and the commercial status of the field, including activities by such major players as Google and Systran.

Many industry experts consider unsupervised learning the next frontier in artificial intelligence, one that may hold the key to general artificial intelligence. Since the majority of the world's data is unlabeled, conventional supervised learning cannot be applied. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, can be applied to unlabeled datasets to discover meaningful patterns buried deep in the data, patterns that may be near impossible for humans to uncover.Author Ankur Patel shows you how to apply unsupervised learning using two simple, production-ready Python frameworks: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow using Keras. With code and hands-on examples, data scientists will identify difficult-to-find patterns in data and gain deeper business insight, detect anomalies, perform automatic feature engineering and selection, and generate synthetic datasets. All you need is programming and some machine learning experience to get started.Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different machine learning approaches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learningSet up and manage machine learning projects end-to-endBuild an anomaly detection system to catch credit card fraudClusters users into distinct and homogeneous groupsPerform semisupervised learningDevelop movie recommender systems using restricted Boltzmann machinesGenerate synthetic images using generative adversarial networks

The future is now. Acclaimed technologist and inventor Amir Husain explains how we can live amidst the coming age of sentient machines and artificial intelligence--and not only survive, but thrive. Artificial ""machine"" intelligence is playing an ever-greater role in our society. We are already using cruise control in our cars, automatic checkout at the drugstore, and are unable to live without our smartphones. The discussion around AI is polarized; people think either machines will solve all problems for everyone, or they will lead us down a dark, dystopian path into total human irrelevance. Regardless of what you believe, the idea that we might bring forth intelligent creation can be intrinsically frightening. But what if our greatest role as humans so far is that of creators? Amir Husain, a brilliant inventor and computer scientist, argues that we are on the cusp of writing our next, and greatest, creation myth. It is the dawn of a new form of intellectual diversity, one that we need to embrace in order to advance the state of the art in many critical fields, including security, resource management, finance, and energy. ""In The Sentient Machine, Husain prepares us for a brighter future; not with hyperbole about right and wrong, but with serious arguments about risk and potential"" (Dr. Greg Hyslop, Chief Technology Officer, The Boeing Company). He addresses broad existential questions surrounding the coming of AI: Why are we valuable? What can we create in this world? How are we intelligent? What constitutes progress for us? And how might we fail to progress? Husain boils down complex computer science and AI concepts into clear, plainspoken language and draws from a wide variety of cultural and historical references to illustrate his points. Ultimately, Husain challenges many of our societal norms and upends assumptions we hold about ""the good life.""

This book presents deep learning techniques, concepts, and algorithms to classify and analyze big data. Further, it offers an introductory level understanding of the new programming languages and tools used to analyze big data in real-time, such as Hadoop, SPARK, and GRAPHX. Big data analytics using traditional techniques face various challenges, such as fast, accurate and efficient processing of big data in real-time. In addition, the Internet of Things is progressively increasing in various fields, like smart cities, smart homes, and e-health. As the enormous number of connected devices generate huge amounts of data every day, we need sophisticated algorithms to deal, organize, and classify this data in less processing time and space. Similarly, existing techniques and algorithms for deep learning in big data field have several advantages thanks to the two main branches of the deep learning, i.e. convolution and deep belief networks. This book offers insights into these techniques and applications based on these two types of deep learning.Further, it helps students, researchers, and newcomers understand big data analytics based on deep learning approaches. It also discusses various machine learning techniques in concatenation with the deep learning paradigm to support high-end data processing, data classifications, and real-time data processing issues. The classification and presentation are kept quite simple to help the readers and students grasp the basics concepts of various deep learning paradigms and frameworks. It mainly focuses on theory rather than the mathematical background of the deep learning concepts. The book consists of 5 chapters, beginning with an introductory explanation of big data and deep learning techniques, followed by integration of big data and deep learning techniques and lastly the future directions.

These proceedings showcase the best papers selected from more than 500 submissions, introducing readers to the top research topics and the latest developmental trends in the theory and application of Man-Machine-Environment System Engineering (MMESE). This research topic was first established in China by Professor Shengzhao Long in 1981, with direct support from one of the greatest modern Chinese scientists, Xuesen Qian. In a letter to Shengzhao Long from October 22nd, 1993, Xuesen Qian wrote: ""You have created a very important modern science and technology in China!"" MMESE primarily focuses on the relationship between Man, Machine and Environment, studying the optimum combination of related Man-Machine-Environment systems. In this paradigm, ""Man"" refers to working people as the subject at the workplace (e.g. operators, decision-makers); ""Machine"" is the general name for any object controlled by Man (including tools, machinery, computers, systems and technologies), and ""Environment"" describes the specific working conditions under which Man and Machine interact (e.g. temperature, noise, vibration, hazardous gases etc.). In turn, the three goals of optimization are to ensure safety, efficiency and economy in this context. These proceedings present interdisciplinary studies on the concepts and methods of physiology, psychology, system engineering, computer science, environmental science, management, education, and other related disciplines. They offer a valuable resource for all researchers and professionals whose work involves interdisciplinary areas touching on MMESE subjects.

How deep learning--from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants--is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy.The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy.Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.

This timely book provides broad coverage of vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) issues, such as security, and network selection. Machine learning based methods are applied to solve these issues. This book also includes four rigorously refereed chapters from prominent international researchers working in this subject area. The material serves as a useful reference for researchers, graduate students, and practitioners seeking solutions to VANET communication and security related issues. This book will also help readers understand how to use machine learning to address the security and communication challenges in VANETs. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) support vehicle-to-vehicle communications and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications to improve the transmission security, help build unmanned-driving, and support booming applications of onboard units (OBUs). The high mobility of OBUs and the large-scale dynamic network with fixed roadside units (RSUs) make the VANET vulnerable to jamming.  The anti-jamming communication of VANETs can be significantly improved by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to relay the OBU message. UAVs help relay the OBU message to improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the OBU signals, and thus reduce the bit-error-rate of the OBU message, especially if the serving RSUs are blocked by jammers and/or interference, which is also demonstrated in this book.This book serves as a useful reference for researchers, graduate students, and practitioners seeking solutions to VANET communication and security related issues.

This volume contains lecture notes of the 14th Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2018), held in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, in September 2018. The research areas of Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Knowledge Graphs have recently received a lot of attention in academia and industry. Since its inception in 2001, the Semantic Web has aimed at enriching the existing Web with meta-data and processing methods, so as to provide Web-based systems with intelligent capabilities such as context awareness and decision support. The Semantic Web vision has been driving many community efforts which have invested a lot of resources in developing vocabularies and ontologies for annotating their resources semantically. Besides ontologies, rules have long been a central part of the Semantic Web framework and are available as one of its fundamental representation tools, with logic serving as a unifying foundation. Linked Data is a related research area which studies how one can make RDF data available on the Web and interconnect it with other data with the aim of increasing its value for everybody. Knowledge Graphs have been shown useful not only for Web search (as demonstrated by Google, Bing, etc.) but also in many application domains.

Imagine a robotic stuffed animal that can read and respond to a child's emotional state, a commercial that can recognize and change based on a customer's facial expression, or a company that can actually create feelings as though a person were experiencing them naturally. Heart of the Machine explores the next giant step in the relationship between humans and technology: the ability of computers to recognize, respond to, and even replicate emotions. Computers have long been integral to our lives, and their advances continue at an exponential rate. Many believe that artificial intelligence equal or superior to human intelligence will happen in the not-too-distance future; some even think machine consciousness will follow. Futurist Richard Yonck argues that emotion, the first, most basic, and most natural form of communication, is at the heart of how we will soon work with and use computers. Instilling emotions into computers is the next leap in our centuries-old obsession with creating machines that replicate humans. But for every benefit this progress may bring to our lives, there is a possible pitfall. Emotion recognition could lead to advanced surveillance, and the same technology that can manipulate our feelings could become a method of mass control. And, as shown in movies like Her and Ex Machina, our society already holds a deep-seated anxiety about what might happen if machines could actually feel and break free from our control. Heart of the Machine is an exploration of the new and inevitable ways in which mankind and technology will interact.

A sharp-eyed exploration of the promise and peril of having children in an age of genetic tests and interventionsIs screening for disease in an embryo a humane form of family planning or a slippery slope toward eugenics? Should doctors tell you that your infant daughter is genetically predisposed to breast cancer? If tests revealed that your toddler has a genetic mutation whose significance isn't clear, would you want to know?In The Gene Machine, the award-winning journalist Bonnie Rochman deftly explores these hot-button questions, guiding us through the new frontier of gene technology and how it is transforming medicine, bioethics, health care, and the factors that shape a family. Rochman tells the stories of scientists working to unlock the secrets of the human genome; genetic counselors and spiritual advisers guiding mothers and fathers through life-changing choices; and, of course, parents (including Rochman herself) grappling with revelations that are sometimes joyous, sometimes heartbreaking, but always profound. She navigates the dizzying and constantly expanding array of prenatal and postnatal tests, from carrier screening to genome sequencing, while considering how access to more tests is altering perceptions of disability and changing the conversation about what sort of life is worth living and who draws the line. Along the way, she highlights the most urgent ethical quandary: Is this technology a triumph of modern medicine or a Pandora's box of possibilities?Propelled by human narratives and meticulously reported, The Gene Machine is both a scientific road map and a meditation on our power to shape the future. It is a book that gets to the very core of what it means to be human.

This book provides a general overview of multiple instance learning (MIL), defining the framework and covering the central paradigms. The authors discuss the most important algorithms for MIL such as classification, regression and clustering. With a focus on classification, a taxonomy is set and the most relevant proposals are specified. Efficient algorithms are developed to discover relevant information when working with uncertainty. Key representative applications are included.This book carries out a study of the key related fields of distance metrics and alternative hypothesis. Chapters examine new and developing aspects of MIL such as data reduction for multi-instance problems and imbalanced MIL data. Class imbalance for multi-instance problems is defined at the bag level, a type of representation that utilizes ambiguity due to the fact that bag labels are available, but the labels of the individual instances are not defined.Additionally, multiple instance multiple label learning is explored. This learning framework introduces flexibility and ambiguity in the object representation providing a natural formulation for representing complicated objects. Thus, an object is represented by a bag of instances and is allowed to have associated multiple class labels simultaneously. This book is suitable for developers and engineers working to apply MIL techniques to solve a variety of real-world problems. It is also useful for researchers or students seeking a thorough overview of MIL literature, methods, and tools.

In Your Brain Is a Time Machine, brain researcher and best-selling author Dean Buonomano draws on evolutionary biology, physics, and philosophy to present his influential theory of how we tell, and perceive, time. The human brain, he argues, is a complex system that not only tells time but creates it; it constructs our sense of chronological flow and enables ""mental time travel""--simulations of future and past events. These functions are essential not only to our daily lives but to the evolution of the human race: without the ability to anticipate the future, mankind would never have crafted tools or invented agriculture. The brain was designed to navigate our continuously changing world by predicting what will happen and when.Buonomano combines neuroscience expertise with a far-ranging, multidisciplinary approach. With engaging style, he illuminates such concepts as consciousness, spacetime, and relativity while addressing profound questions that have long occupied scientists and philosophers alike: What is time? Is our sense of time's passage an illusion? Does free will exist, or is the future predetermined? In pursuing the answers, Buonomano reveals as much about the fascinating architecture of the human brain as he does about the intricacies of time itself. This virtuosic work of popular science leads to an astonishing realization: your brain is, at its core, a time machine.

Traditionally, genetics laboratory exercises at the university level focus on mono- and dihybrid crosses and phenotypic analysis--exercises under traditional time, materials, and process constraints. Lately, molecular techniques such as gene cloning, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and bioinformatics are being included in many teaching laboratories--where affordable. Human chromosome analysis, when present at all, has often been restricted to simple identification of chromosomes by number, through the usual ""cut-and-paste"" method. Although several online karyotyping (chromosome identification) programs have become available, they are not meaningful for studying the dynamics of the chromosome system, nor do they help students understand genetics as a discipline. The software that accompanies this book has been shown to be an ideal tool for learning about genetics, which requires a combination of understanding, conceptualization, and practical experience.

This book explores the usage of Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Coordination. Chapter 1 introduces fundamentals of the multi-robot coordination. Chapter 2 offers two useful properties, which have been developed to speed-up the convergence of traditional multi-agent Q-learning (MAQL) algorithms in view of the team-goal exploration, where team-goal exploration refers to simultaneous exploration of individual goals. Chapter 3 proposes the novel consensus Q-learning (CoQL), which addresses the equilibrium selection problem. Chapter 4 introduces a new dimension in the literature of the traditional correlated Q-learning (CQL), in which correlated equilibrium (CE) is computed partly in the learning and the rest in the planning phases, thereby requiring CE computation once only. Chapter 5 proposes an alternative solution to the multi-agent planning problem using meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. Chapter 6 provides the concluding remarks based on the principles and experimental results acquired in the previous chapters. Possible future directions of research are also examined briefly at the end of the chapter.

In Abstract Machine, author Charles Travis uses GIS technology to interpret, analyze, and visualize literary, historical, and philosophical texts. Travis's study shows how mapping language patterns, fictional landscapes, geographic spaces, and philosophical concepts helps support critical analysis. Travis bases his interpretive model upon the ancient Greek and Roman practice of geographia, and applies it to works by authors including Samuel Beckett, Patrick Kavanagh, Flann O'Brien, and James Joyce. Travis illustrates how scholars in the humanities can experiment with GIS to create visualizations that support and illustrate their critical analysis of humanities texts, and survey, navigate, and imagine various story-paths through space and time.

In the 1990s Richard B. Alley and his colleagues made headlines with the discovery that the last ice age came to an abrupt end over a period of only three years. In The Two-Mile Time Machine, Alley tells the fascinating history of global climate changes as revealed by reading the annual rings of ice from cores drilled in Greenland. He explains that humans have experienced an unusually temperate climate compared to the wild fluctuations that characterized most of prehistory. He warns that our comfortable environment could come to an end in a matter of years and tells us what we need to know in order to understand and perhaps overcome climate changes in the future.In a new preface, the author weighs in on whether our understanding of global climate change has altered in the years since the book was first published, what the latest research tells us, and what he is working on next.-- ""Choice""

WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZEONE OF THE ""NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW""'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEARA ""NEW YORK TIMES"" BESTSELLERA NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FINALISTA major book about the future of the world, blending intellectual and natural history and field reporting into a powerful account of the mass extinction unfolding before our eyes Over the last half-billion years, there have been Five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, ""New Yorker"" writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.

In The Second Machine Age MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee--two thinkers at the forefront of their field--reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives.Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds--from lawyers to truck drivers--will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar.Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape.A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.

The future is now. Acclaimed technologist and inventor Amir Husain explains how we can live amidst the coming age of sentient machines and artificial intelligence--and not only survive, but thrive. Artificial ""machine"" intelligence is playing an ever-greater role in our society. We are already using cruise control in our cars, automatic checkout at the drugstore, and are unable to live without our smartphones. The discussion around AI is polarized; people think either machines will solve all problems for everyone, or they will lead us down a dark, dystopian path into total human irrelevance. Regardless of what you believe, the idea that we might bring forth intelligent creation can be intrinsically frightening. But what if our greatest role as humans so far is that of creators? Amir Husain, a brilliant inventor and computer scientist, argues that we are on the cusp of writing our next, and greatest, creation myth. It is the dawn of a new form of intellectual diversity, one that we need to embrace in order to advance the state of the art in many critical fields, including security, resource management, finance, and energy. ""In The Sentient Machine, Husain prepares us for a brighter future; not with hyperbole about right and wrong, but with serious arguments about risk and potential"" (Dr. Greg Hyslop, Chief Technology Officer, The Boeing Company). He addresses broad existential questions surrounding the coming of AI: Why are we valuable? What can we create in this world? How are we intelligent? What constitutes progress for us? And how might we fail to progress? Husain boils down complex computer science and AI concepts into clear, plainspoken language and draws from a wide variety of cultural and historical references to illustrate his points. Ultimately, Husain challenges many of our societal norms and upends assumptions we hold about ""the good life.""

The science behind global warming, and its history: how scientists learned to understand the atmosphere, to measure it, to trace its past, and to model its future.Global warming skeptics often fall back on the argument that the scientific case for global warming is all model predictions, nothing but simulation; they warn us that we need to wait for real data, ""sound science."" In A Vast Machine Paul Edwards has news for these skeptics: without models, there are no data. Today, no collection of signals or observations--even from satellites, which can ""see"" the whole planet with a single instrument--becomes global in time and space without passing through a series of data models. Everything we know about the world's climate we know through models. Edwards offers an engaging and innovative history of how scientists learned to understand the atmosphere--to measure it, trace its past, and model its future.

Medical Physics Monograph #36 was written for the 2013 AAPM Summer School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Task Group 100 examined quality and safety techniques that have proven effective in industry and, more recently, in many medical disciplines. These techniques consider not only QA for equipment, but also for procedures as a whole in the context of the facility. These approaches and methodologies may be new and somewhat daunting to many practicing medical physicists. The goal of this book is to make these new techniques accessible to the broader medical physics community. The text features practice exercises that reinforce the concepts learned in the book. It also includes a CD containing the text, large tables, and many of the book's images in color.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the fields of pattern recognition and machine vision in academia and industries. New theories have been developed with new technology and systems designs in both hardware and software. They are widely applied to our daily life to solve real problems in diverse areas such as science, engineering, agriculture, e-commerce, education, robotics, government, medicine, games and animation, medical imaging analysis and diagnosis, military, and national security.The foundation of this field can be traced back to the late Prof. King-Sun Fu, one of the founding fathers of pattern recognition, who, with visionary insight, founded the International Association for Pattern Recognition in 1978. Almost 30 years later, the world has witnessed this field's rapid growth and development. It is probably true to say that most people are affected by or use applications of pattern recognition in daily life.Today, on the eve of 25th anniversary of the unfortunate and untimely passing of Prof. Fu, we are proud to produce this collection works from world renowned professionals and experts in pattern recognition and machine vision in honor and memory of the late Prof. King-Sun Fu. We hope this book will help further promote not only fundamental principles, systems, and technologies but also the vast range of applications that help in solving problems in daily life.

In this mind-expanding book, scientific pioneer Marvin Minsky continues his groundbreaking research, offering a fascinating new model for how our minds work. He argues persuasively that emotions, intuitions, and feelings are not distinct things, but different ways of thinking.  By examining these different forms of mind activity, Minsky says, we can explain why our thought sometimes takes the form of carefully reasoned analysis and at other times turns to emotion. He shows how our minds progress from simple, instinctive kinds of thought to more complex forms, such as consciousness or self-awareness. And he argues that because we tend to see our thinking as fragmented, we fail to appreciate what powerful thinkers we really are. Indeed, says Minsky, if thinking can be understood as the step-by-step process that it is, then we can build machines -- artificial intelligences -- that not only can assist with our thinking by thinking as we do but have the potential to be as conscious as we are.  Eloquently written, The Emotion Machine is an intriguing look into a future where more powerful artificial intelligences await.

Continuing the pattern set by American Lathe Builders and American Planer, Shaper and Slotter Builders, this is the first book to identify American builders of milling machines and the products they invented circa 1818 to the development of the ""modern"" milling machine circa 1920. Early versions of other American machine tools were largely copied from European, especially British, machines. The milling machine, however, was an American development. Built first for the firearms and sewing machine industries, it proved to be much more productive than other methods, and soon held a major place in all high-production American machine shops. The book lists more than 300 makers and contains over 1,400 illustrations taken from original catalogs and contemporary periodicals. These trace the development of the milling machine from a crude, light weight machine to very large millers capable of machining parts the size of boxcars and weighing many tons. Attachments such as dividing heads, vises, etc., are also covered.

Focusing on how a machine ""feels"" and behaves while operating, Machine Elements: Life and Design seeks to impart both intellectual and emotional comprehension regarding the ""life"" of a machine. It presents a detailed description of how machines elements function, seeking to form a sympathetic attitude toward the machine and to ensure its wellbeing through more careful and proper design. The book is divided into three sections for accessibility and ease of comprehension. The first section is devoted to microscopic deformations and displacements both in permanent connections and within the bodies of stressed parts. Topics include relative movements in interference fit connections and bolted joints, visual demonstrations and clarifications of the phenomenon of stress concentration, and increasing the load capacity of parts using prior elasto-plastic deformation and surface plastic deformation. The second part examines machine elements and units. Topics include load capacity calculations of interference fit connections under bending, new considerations about the role of the interference fit in key joints, a detailed examination of bolts loaded by eccentrically applied tension forces, resistance of cylindrical roller bearings to axial displacement under load, and a new approach to the choice of fits for rolling contact bearings. The third section addresses strength calculations and life prediction of machine parts. It includes information on the phenomena of static strength and fatigue; correlation between calculated and real strength and safety factors; and error migration.

A startling expos矇 of how much Big Brother knows about you We are entering a new state of global hypersurveillance. As we increasingly resort to technology for our work and play, our electronic activity leaves behind digital footprints that can be used to track our movements. In our cars, telephones, even our coffee machines, tiny computers communicating wirelessly via the Internet can serve as miniature witnesses, forming powerful networks whose emergent behaviour can be very complex, intelligent, and invasive. The question is: how much of an infringement on privacy are they? Exposing the invasion of our privacy from CCTVs to blogs, ""The Spy in the Coffee Machine"" explores what - if anything - we can do to prevent it from disappearing forever in the digital age, and provides readers with a much needed wake-up call to the benefits and dangers of this new technology.

From the scorching center of Earth's core to the outer limits of its atmosphere, from the gradual process of erosion that carved the Grand Canyon to the earth-shaking fury of volcanoes and earthquakes, this fascinating book--inspired by the award-winning Hall of Planet Earth at New York City's American Museum of Natural History--tells the story of the evolution of our planet and of the science that makes it work. With the same exuberance and expertise they brought to the creation of the Hall of Planet Earth, co-curators Edmond A. Mathez and James D. Webster offer a guided tour of Earth's dynamic, 4.6-billion-year history. Including numerous full-color photographs of the innovative exhibit and helpful, easy-to-understand illustrations, the authors explore the major factors in our planet's evolution: how Earth emerged from the swirling dusts of a nascent solar system; how an oxygen-rich, life-sustaining atmosphere developed; how continents, mountain ranges, and oceans formed; and how earthquakes and volcanic eruptions alter Earth's surface. Traversing geologic time and delving into the depths of the planet---beginning with meteorites containing minuscule particles that are the solar system's oldest known objects, and concluding with the unusual microbial life that lives on the chemical and thermal energy produced by sulfide vents in the ocean floor--The Earth Machine provides an up-to-date overview of the central theories and discoveries in earth science today. By incorporating stories of real-life fieldwork, Mathez and Webster explain how Earth is capable of supporting life, how even the smallest rocks can hold the key to explaining the formation of mountains, and how scientists have learned to read nature's subtle clues and interpret Earth's ever-evolving narrative.

This volume is about the history of experimentation in science education. The teaching of science through experiments and observation is essential to the natural sciences and its pedagogy. These have been conducted as both demonstration or as student exercises. The experimental method is seen as giving the student vital competence, skills and experiences, both at the school and at the university level. This volume addresses the historical development of experiments in science education, which has been largely neglected so far. The contributors pay attention to various aspects ranging from economic aspects of instrument making for science teaching, to the political meanings of experimental science education from the 17th to the 20th century. This collected volume opens the field for further debate by emphasizing the importance of experiments for both, historians of science and science educators.

解決各種學習困擾——

 上課老是恍神，被老師大喊「要專心！」
 放空、塗鴉或大做白日夢，都是讓大腦「發散模式」運行的好機會。

 常常把功課拖到最後一秒鐘才完成
 用「番茄鐘工作法」迅速集中注意力，打敗拖延的壞習慣。

 為了考試拼命熬夜，臨時抱佛腳
 考試前一定要睡飽！睡眠是確保資訊在腦中牢牢扎根的關鍵。

 明明很聰明，但就是考不好
 瞭解大腦喜歡怎麼理解和記憶，「圖畫散步」和「積極回想」發揮好腦力！

 做事丟三落四，年紀輕輕就是「金魚腦」
 蓋一座「記憶宮殿」，將要記住的東西圖像化，深化長期記憶。

 每次學習新的技能，很快就碰上撞牆期，最後只剩三分鐘熱度
 拉長練習週期，選擇困難的部分去「刻意練習」，強化腦連結。

There's nothing that hard-core Unix and Linux users are more fanatical about than their text editor. Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. vi has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite vi as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been the guide for vi. However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of Learning the vi and vim Editors has been expanded to include detailed information on vim, the leading vi clone. vim is the default version of vi on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too.With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic.Learning the vi and vim Editors includes: A complete introduction to text editing with vi: How to move around vi in a hurryBeyond the basics, such as using buffersvi's global search and replacementAdvanced editing, including customizing vi and executing Unix commandsHow to make full use of vim: Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressionsMulti-window editing and powerful vim scriptsHow to make full use of the GUI version of vim, called gvimvim's enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tagsCoverage of three other popular vi clones -- nvi, elvis, and vile -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both vi and ex mode commands for regular vi and for vim, plus an updated appendix on vi and the Internet.Learning either vi or vim is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential. After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.

The rapid advancement in the theoretical understanding of statistical and machine learning methods for semisupervised learning has made it difficult for nonspecialists to keep up to date in the field. Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning.

If you've asked someone the secret to writing efficient, well-written software, the answer that you've probably gotten is ""learn assembly language programming."" By learning assembly language programming, you learn how the machine really operates and that knowledge will help you write better high-level language code. A dirty little secret assembly language programmers rarely admit to, however, is that what you really need to learn is machine organization, not assembly language programming. Write Great Code Vol I, the first in a series from assembly language expert Randall Hyde, dives right into machine organization without the extra overhead of learning assembly language programming at the same time. And since Write Great Code Vol I concentrates on the machine organization, not assembly language, the reader will learn in greater depth those subjects that are language-independent and of concern to a high level language programmer. Write Great Code Vol I will help programmers make wiser choices with respect to programming statements and data types when writing software, no matter which language they use.

This easy-to-use introduction to Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is ideal for developers who want to learn to build services on a company network or as part of an enterprise system. Built into Windows Vista and Longhorn, and available for Windows XP and Windows 2003, WCF provides a platform for service-oriented architecture (SOA) that enables secure and reliable communication among systems within an organization or across the Internet. With WCF, software developers can focus on their business applications and not the plumbing required to connect them. Furthermore, with WCF developers can learn a single programming API to achieve results previously provided by ASMX, Enterprise Services and .NET Remoting. Learning WCF removes the complexity of using this platform by providing detailed answers, explanations and code samples for the most common questions asked by software developers. Windows Communication Foundation (or WCF, formerly code name ""Indigo"") provides a set of programming APIs that make it easy to build and consume secure, reliable, and transacted services. This platform removes the need for developers to learn different technologies such as ASMX, Enterprise Services and .NET Remoting, to distribute system functionality on a corporate network or over the Internet. The first truly service-oriented platform, WCF provides innovations that decouple service design and development from deployment and distribution - creating a more flexible and agile environment. WCF also encapsulates all of the latest web service standards for addressing, security, reliability and more.

This new edition is intended for the undergraduate one or two semester course in modern algebra, also called abstract algebra. It follows a logical path, using the axioms or rules to understand structures such as groups, rings, and fields, and giving the reader examples to help, but leaving many theorems and examples for them to try. The unique feature of the text is the list of ""projects"" at the end of each chapter that can be used in the classroom (with students solving them), alone, or in groups with the aid of an instructor. Because of their interactive nature, the projects are designed to reinforce previous concepts.Features:  A logic-based presentation, with the structures of groups, rings, and fields presented in similar ways through objects, sub-objects, mappings between objects, and quotients of objectsFollows a fairly straight path without many of the side areas, such as modules, in order to introduce Galois Theory and solvability of polynomialsProvides numerous examples, exercises, and the inclusion of ""projects"" in each chapterAdds more, varied examples to use when illustrating ideas such as order of elements, direct products, and subgroupsIncludes new material on the history of mathematics with vignettes of mathematicians Provides instructor's resources with solutions and PowerPoint slides for use as a textbook

Tracy Kidder's ""riveting"" (Washington Post) story of one company's efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and has become essential reading for understanding the history of the American tech industry. Computers have changed since 1981, when The Soul of a New Machine first examined the culture of the computer revolution. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations.The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.

XSLT is a powerful language for transforming XML documents into something else. That something else can be an HTML document, another XML document, a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file, a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) file, Java code, or a number of other things. You write an XSLT stylesheet to define the rules for transforming an XML document, and the XSLT processor does the work. As useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it a difficult language in which to get started. In fact, newcomers are often a little dazed on first contact. Learning XSLT offers a hands-on introduction to help them get up to speed with XSLT quickly. The book will help web developers and designers understand this powerful but often mystifying template-driven and functional-styled language, getting them over the many differences between XSLT and the more conventional programming languages. Learning XSLT moves smoothly from the simple to complex, illustrating all aspects of XSLT 1.0 through step-by-step examples that you'll practice as you work through the book. Thorough in its coverage of the language, the book makes few assumptions about what you may already know. You'll learn about XSLT's template-based syntax, how XSLT templates work with each other, and gain an understanding of XSLT variables. Learning XSLT also explains how the XML Path Language (XPath) is used by XSLT and provides a glimpse of what the future holds for XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0. The ability to transform one XML vocabulary to another is fundamental to exploiting the power of XML. Learning XSLT is a carefully paced, example-rich introduction to XSLT that will have you understanding and using XSLT on your own in no time.

Learning Carbon is designed to get you programming right away in Carbon(TM), one of two APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces) Macintosh(R) programmers can use to write applications that run native in Mac(R) OS X. Using Carbon, you don't have to rewrite your Mac OS programs entirely to get them to take advantage of the new features in Mac OS X. Instead, all you have to rewrite is the 10 to 20 percent of the code that can't be translated to OS X. For C programmers, Apple's Carbon is the essential building block for applications on Mac OS X. With Carbon, you can use simple, traditional C interfaces to create world-class applications for a world-class operating system.After orienting you with a detailed tour of a Carbon application, Learning Carbon walks you through the entire process of designing and creating a complete Carbon application called Moon Travel Planner. Along the way, you'll be introduced to two pivotal development tools: Project Builder and Interface Builder. You'll learn key concepts about Carbon and Mac OS X programming, including event management, resource handling, and bundle anatomy. And you'll get direct, hands-on instruction on how to implement essential application tasks, such as managing windows, printing documents, opening and saving files, creating and responding to menu commands, providing user help, and organizing your application for easy localization in multiple countries and languages. After finishing this book, you'll be ready to start writing your own Carbon applications.Written by Apple insiders with access to engineers deeply involved in creating Mac OS X, Learning Carbon brings you information that's not available anywhere else, to get you in on the ground floor of the exciting new Mac OS X application development market.

The GNU/Linux(R) success story is well known. Firmly established as a high-performance operating system, its worldwide installations are increasing at phenomenal rates. Much of this success has been on the server side, but more and more PC users are turning to Linux on the desktop, as well.For those grounded in Microsoft Windows(R) or Apple Macintosh(R) graphical interfaces, the first look at a powerful Unix-style operating system can be daunting. This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the popular Red Hat(R) distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and what you need to know to get over the humps.Linux is known as a secure environment and a good platform to run a web server. These topics are among the many covered in this book. But did you know you can also burn CDs, sync a PalmPilot(TM), and edit slideshow presentations with powerful tools on Linux? Those topics are covered here, too.Red Hat currently provides two distributions, both documented in this book. The first is their commercial, subscription-based product, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also available through retail channels as Red Hat Professional Workstation. The second is the freely distributed Fedora distribution. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included in this book on two disks.New in this edition are installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system.Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora tells you how to: Prepare your system for installing LinuxInstall and configure Linux and the two popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE.Run the most popular productivity tools on Linux: mailers, web browsers, OpenOffice, and Evolution.Obtain and set up software through the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)Set up a Linux system for networking, either on your local area network (LAN), or via a dialup connection to the Internet.Use the system-administration tools included with Red Hat, GNOME, and KDE, including such valuable utilities as Samba file-sharing and the Apache web server.Understand and write shell scripts so you can peek under the hood and extend the power of Linux.

The Hill and Wang Critical Issues Series: concise, affordable works on pivotal topics in American history, society, and politics. In this pioneering study, White explores the relationship between the natural history of the Columbia River and the human history of the Pacific Northwest for both whites and Native Americans. He concentrates on what brings humans and the river together: not only the physical space of the region but also, and primarily, energy and work. For working with the river has been central to Pacific Northwesterners' competing ways of life. It is in this way that White comes to view the Columbia River as an organic machine--with conflicting human and natural claims--and to show that whatever separation exists between humans and nature exists to be crossed.

The Korn shell is an interactive command and scripting language for accessing Unix(R) and other computer systems. As a complete and high-level programming language in itself, it's been a favorite since it was developed in the mid 1980s by David G. Korn at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Knowing how to use it is an essential skill for serious Unix users. Learning the Korn Shell shows you how to use the Korn shell as a user interface and as a programming environment.Writing applications is often easier and quicker with Korn than with other high-level languages. Because of this, the Korn shell is the most often used shell in commercial environments and among inexperienced users. There are two other widely used shells, the Bourne shell and the C shell. The Korn shell, or ksh, has the best features of both, plus many new features of its own. ksh can do much to enhance productivity and the quality of a user's work, both in interacting with the system, and in programming. The new version, ksh93, has the functionality of other scripting languages such as awk, icon, Perl, rexx, and tcl.Learning the Korn Shell is the key to gaining control of the Korn shell and becoming adept at using it as an interactive command and scripting language. Prior programming experience is not required in order to understand the chapters on basic shell programming. Readers will learn how to write many applications more easily and quickly than with other high-level languages. In addition, readers will also learn about Unix utilities and the way the Unix operating system works in general. The authors maintain that you shouldn't have to be an internals expert to use and program the shell effectively.The second edition covers all the features of the current version of the Korn shell, including many new features not in earlier versions of ksh93, making it the most up-to-date reference available on the Korn shell. It compares the current version of the Korn shell to several other Bourne-compatible shells, including several Unix emulation environments for MS-DOS and Windows. In addition, it describes how to download and build ksh93 from source code.A solid offering for many years, this newly revised title inherits a long tradition of trust among computer professionals who want to learn or refine an essential skill.

This second edition of the bestselling Learning XML provides web developers with a concise but grounded understanding of XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and its potential-- not just a whirlwind tour of XML. The author explains the important and relevant XML technologies and their capabilities clearly and succinctly with plenty of real-life projects and useful examples. He outlines the elements of markup--demystifying concepts such as attributes, entities, and namespaces--and provides enough depth and examples to get started. Learning XML is a reliable source for anyone who needs to know XML, but doesn't want to waste time wading through hundreds of web sites or 800 pages of bloated text.  For writers producing XML documents, this book clarifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format. Designers will learn what parts of XML are most helpful to their team and will get started on creating Document Type Definitions. For programmers, the book makes syntax and structures clear. Learning XML also discusses the stylesheets needed for viewing documents in the next generation of browsers, databases, and other devices. Learning XML illustrates the core XML concepts and language syntax, in addition to important related tools such as the CSS and XSL styling languages and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures. It includes information about three schema languages for validation: W3C Schema, Schematron, and RELAX-NG, which are gaining widespread support from people who need to validate documents but aren't satisfied with DTDs. Also new in this edition is a chapter on XSL-FO, a powerful formatting language for XML. If you need to wade through the acronym soup of XML and start to really use this powerful tool, Learning XML, will give you the roadmap you need.

Forget about whispering to horses, our author knows their language and talks to them. Almost everyone has had a moment when they felt a connection to an animal, almost as if they were communicating. According to animal communicator and author Marta Williams, they probably were. Over the past 13 years, Marta has worked with clients (people and the animals in their lives) to resolve behavior and training problems, find lost animals, assist animals that are ill or dying, and help animals get along with each other. Her human clients have contacted her from all parts of the globe, and her animal clients have included horses, dogs, and cats. In the course of her work, she has come to believe that anyone can learn to communicate with animals and with nature, and this inviting book teaches readers how they can use techniques and exercises to tune in and learn this language.

If you are new to Unix, this concise book will tell you just what you need to get started and no more. Unix was one of the first operating systems written in C, a high-level programming language, and its natural portability and low price made it a popular choice among universities. Initially, two main dialects of Unix existed: one produced by AT&T known as System V, and one developed at UC Berkeley and known as BSD. In recent years, many other dialects have been created, including the highly popular Linux operating system and the new Mac OS X (a derivative of BSD). Learning the Unix Operating System is a handy book for someone just starting with Unix or Linux, and it's an ideal primer for Mac and PC users of the Internet who need to know a little about Unix on the systems they visit. The fifth edition is the most effective introduction to Unix in print, covering Internet usage for email, file transfers, web browsing, and many major and minor updates to help the reader navigate the ever-expanding capabilities of the operating system:  In response to the popularity of Linux, the book now focuses on the popular bash shell preferred by most Linux users.  Since the release of the fourth edition, the Internet and its many functions has become part of most computer user's lives. A new chapter explains how to use ftp, pine for mail, and offers useful knowledge on how to surf the web.  Today everyone is concerned about security. With this in mind, the author has included tips throughout the text on security basics, especially in the Internet and networking sections. The book includes a completely updated quick reference card to make it easier for the reader to access the key functions of the command line.

毛小孩說不出口的心事，現在你都能懂！
 以溝通取代調教，以理解拉近距離

 全台寵物及野生動物集氣發念力，
 呼喚寵物爸媽、獸醫師、愛護動物人士快來讀的書！

 ★台灣第一本寵物通心入門書
 ★美國首席動物溝通師瑪塔‧威廉斯生涯代表作
 ★全球動物溝通師口耳相傳的自修寶典
 ★Amazon網路書店4.5顆星
 ★國內外獸醫師專文推薦

 「如果你有毛小孩，會不會很渴望可以知道他在想什麼？本書就是為了這樣的需求而寫的。作者瑪塔‧威廉斯把動物通心術抽絲剝繭，帶領我們一步一步進入直覺溝通的世界。」
──謝旻莉醫師（愛寶動物醫院院長、美國認證犬行為治療師）

 「這本書鉅細靡遺地教導了日常生活中，所有可能派上用場的直覺溝通技巧；也將學習過程中可能遭遇的困難，都一一點出。我誠心地推薦給任何想要跟動物作直接心靈交流的人！」
──狗男（動物溝通師、身心靈工作者）

 「這本書教導我們如何發揮同理心，如何反璞歸真、專注靜心，進而接通宇宙智慧並翻轉負面信念。基本上，它就像一本傳授萬物溝通術的個人靈修指南。」
──Phyllis（知名部落客、暢銷書《零雜物》作者）

 ※簡單六步驟，接通你與寵物的感應天線：
 1. 放慢下來：吸氣，停一會，再緩緩吐氣
 2. 向下扎根：感覺自己與地心連結
 3. 保持正面態度：相信自己做得到
 4. 啟動直覺感應力：開啟直覺並連結宇宙智慧
 5. 與動物建立關係：從你的心傳愛到動物的心
 6. 順從你的直覺：不管接收到什麼訊息，統統記下來
 最後，在跟動物對話結束時，要記得說聲「謝謝」。


 有些人可能會把跟動物溝通的能力視為一種天賦，但其實，這能力每個人生來都有，只是在理性邏輯主導的世界中受到了壓抑。生物科學家出身的作者瑪塔一再強調，她本身也不是從小就能與動物溝通的靈媒，而是經過後天的學習，才重拾了人跟動物溝通的能力。而且她堅信，與動物做無聲心靈溝通的本事，只要經過學習跟練習，人人都做得到！

 本書所傳授的心靈直覺溝通法，不是去解讀動物的肢體語言或憑經驗分析，而是透過心靈來傳送與接收訊息，與動物交換想法、感覺與心靈圖像。那是一種無聲的對談能力，它不只可用於與動物溝通，也適用於人跟天地萬物之間的心靈交流。你可以跟小至昆蟲、大至大象等生物溝通，也能跟植物、河流、高山等大自然的靈對話。透過書中鉅細靡遺的62個練習，你將能循序漸進地培養出與萬物作直覺溝通的能力。

學習不該只是一種流行，重要的是能否適切地應用於工作上，並與個人及組織的績效結合。近年來，人力資源的發展已逐漸受到企業和組織的重視，對於沒有豐富天然資源的台灣而言，人力資源的發展顯得格外重要。在今日資訊發達的時代，學習已然成為企業競爭力和生存權的重要指標。在終身學習的世紀裡，和與日俱增的人才競爭，組織除了不能浪費有限的資源，還必須發展(與訓練)自己的勞工。組織必須確認他們的勞工所獲得的知識、技能和態度，能被應用來達成他們的目標和方針。這是一個迫切的商業需求。因此，組織需要建立、促進，並且營造一種能讓員工正面移轉新技能到工作上的氣候。這看似容易，其實不然。原因很多，例如，組織經常不太了解訓練系統如何幫助他們建立這樣的一種移轉氣候。再者，有可能是那些負責設計、交付、評鑑和管理訓練的人，沒有適切的文獻為指南，來幫助他們建立和孕育這樣的一種移轉氣候。因此，借由本書清楚地勾勒出，如何有效地將學習轉移至工作環境上的問題，並集合了精通學習系統運用的創新文章，提供如何促進訓練轉移和實質的建議。

Incorporating an innovative modeling approach, this book for a one-semester differential equations course emphasizes conceptual understanding to help users relate information taught in the classroom to real-world experiences. Certain models reappear throughout the book as running themes to synthesize different concepts from multiple angles, and a dynamical systems focus emphasizes predicting the long-term behavior of these recurring models. Users will discover how to identify and harness the mathematics they will use in their careers, and apply it effectively outside the classroom.

S""tiff is an oddly compelling, often hilarious exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers--some willing, some unwittingly--have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. In this fascinating account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries and tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.
