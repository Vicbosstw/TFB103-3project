Revision with unchanged content. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has become an increasingly popular way to provide phone services. At this moment there is a transition going on from de-livering voice over the Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) to using VoIP tech-nology. There are a number of problems that need to be taken into account in order to design a VoIP system. This book focuses on the problem of line echo. Line echo is created in the 2-wire to 4-wire hybrid circuit between the VoIP phone and the POTS phone and is much more apparent due to the large delay in the packet network; line echo cancellation is necessary to ensure satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS). It turns out that the performance limit of the amount of echo that can be cancelled is set by the non-linear portion of the signal. Line probing is a method of inserting a known signal at the far-end and recording the near-end signal. The two signals are then analyzed to-gether for various impediments like, non-linearities, bad ERL, and noise. Line probing is used in this book to find the performance limit of the echo can-celler as well as other useful metrics of performance. The book is addressed to telecommunications professionals that need to perform testing of echo cancellers in VoIP networks.

This book is for anyone who wants to master Linux from the command line. When writing it, I had in mind system administrators, software developers, and enthusiastic users who want to get things going from the Linux command line. For beginning users, this may be a daunting task, as Linux commands often have many options documented only in pages that are not that easy to understand. This book is distribution agnostic. That is, while writing it, I've checked all items against Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE. Since most distributions are quite similar to one of these three, this book should help you with other distributions as well. There is only one item in the book that is not distribution agnostic: the Appendix, which explains how to install OpenSUSE. I've chosen to cover installation of just one distribution, because if you don't have any Linux installed yet, you probably don't care what you install. If you do care what distribution to work with, you probably have it installed already.

Revision with unchanged content. The Viterbi Algorithm was originally developed in the 1960's to decode linear error correcting convolutional codes. Its advantages include ease of implementation and using soft decisions to obtain an additional and significant coding gain. Viterbi decoding has found widespread application from space and satellite communications, down to dial up telephone modems and elsewhere, provided that a finite state machine description can be set up. Ternary line codes are used in baseband digital communication systems, notably metallic cable systems. What does the finite state machine description of these widely used nonlinear line codes look like? Can Viterbi decoding be applied to ternary line codes? What gains can be expected with soft decision Viterbi decoding? What advantage can be obtained using more bits for finer soft decision quantization? How do these gains compare to the well known 2 dB gain obtained through 3 bit quantization with linear codes? It is shown that the results obtained differ from the standard 3 bit quantization and 2 dB gain scenario. This study may lead to further new applications of Viterbi decoding with soft decisions.

Revision with unchanged content. Traffic estimation and prediction (or dynamic traffic assignment) models are expected to contribute to the reduction of travel time delays. In this book, an on-line calibration approach that jointly estimates all model parameters is presented. The methodology imposes no restrictions on the models, the parameters or the data that can be handled, and emerging or future data can be easily incorporated. The modeling approach is applicable to any simulation model and is not restricted to the application domain covered in this book. Several modified, non-linear Kalman Filter methodologies are presented, e.g. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Iterated EKF, Limiting EKF, and Unscented Kalman Filter. Extensive case studies on freeway networks in Europe and the US are used to demonstrate the approach, to verify the importance of on-line calibration, and to test the presented algorithms. The main target audience of this book comprises Intelligent Transportation Systems researchers and graduate students, as well as practitioners, including Metropolitan Planning Organization engineers and Traffic Management Center operators, and any reader with an interest in dynamic state and parameter estimation.

Revision with unchanged content. The quest for more productive ways of developing high quality software has been ongoing and software product lines promises to improve product qua-li-ty and the development speed at a fraction of the cost. Common examples of product lines in other areas include mobile phones, cars, consumer electronic devices such as TVs and the like. The products in a product line all share some common features and there are some features that are specific to some pro-ducts only. Crucial to this approach is the large-scale reuse of the product line software architecture. This book deals with the problem of assessing, analyzing or evaluating product line architectures. It characterizes such archi-tectures from the point of view of architecture analysis and describes a ho-lis-tic method for completing the assessment. Case studies and discussions help readers use the approach described in their own projects. This book is addres-sed to professional software architects and developers building or planning to build software product lines. It is also directed to-wards researchers in Software Architectures and Software Product Lines.

This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the Poisson line Cox process (PLCP) and its applications to vehicular networks. The PLCP is constructed by placing points on each line of a Poisson line process (PLP) as per an independent Poisson point process (PPP). For vehicular applications, one can imagine the layout of the road network as a PLP and the vehicles on the roads as the points of the PLCP. First, a brief historical account of the evolution of the theory of PLP is provided to familiarize readers with the seminal contributions in this area. In order to provide a self-contained treatment of this topic, the construction and key fundamental properties of both PLP and PLCP are discussed in detail. The rest of the book is devoted to the applications of these models to a variety of wireless networks, including vehicular communication networks and localization networks. Specifically, modeling the locations of vehicular nodes and roadside units (RSUs) using PLCP, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based coverage analysis is presented for both ad hoc and cellular network models. For a similar setting, the load on the cellular macro base stations (MBSs) and RSUs in a vehicular network is also characterized analytically. For the localization networks, PLP is used to model blockages, which is shown to facilitate the characterization of asymptotic blind spot probability in a localization application. Finally, the path distance characteristics for a special case of PLCP are analyzed, which can be leveraged to answer critical questions in the areas of transportation networks and urban planning. The book is concluded with concrete suggestions on future directions of research. Based largely on the original research of the authors, this is the first book that specifically focuses on the self-contained mathematical treatment of the PLCP. The ideal audience of this book is graduate students as well as researchers in academia and industry who are familiar with probability theory, have some exposure to point processes, and are interested in the field of stochastic geometry and vehicular networks. Given the diverse backgrounds of the potential readers, the focus has been on providing an accessible and pedagogical treatment of this topic by consciously avoiding the measure theoretic details without compromising mathematical rigor.

This book presents timely work on the nature of the physical processes underpinning two of the basic characteristics of the gas structure in the innermost region of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN): ionized outflows and emission line regions. In addition, it describes physics-based methods for estimating the density of the astrophysical plasma surrounding AGN. All numerical computations of the photoionized gas employ the most advanced codes available (CLOUDY and TITAN). Calculations of the radiative transfer are based on the assumption of thermal and ionization equilibrium. Promising preliminary examples of comparison with current observations are included for several individual AGN. All of them suggest that the absorbing/emitting gas should have a density on the order of 1012 cm-3. Future observations will provide more objects to verify these results, and will allow us to put constraints on the launch radius of ionized outflows and therefore on the mass loading and kinetic energy outflow rates. These rates, in turn, are crucial to estimating whether the outflows have a significant feedback impact on star formation and metal enrichment in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. In closing, the book discusses a representative example of applying powerful photoionization techniques to explain the complex physics of the AGN environment.

The limit equilibrium (LE) methods were used in this book to analyse the stability of existing cut slopes of the Abuja Rail Mass Transit Project, lot 3A, Abuja, Nigeria. The Stability Number Method, the Infinite Slope Method, the Ordinary Method of Slices also called the Fellenius Method and the Simplified Bishop Method were employed manually to perform the stability analyses for both cohesive and frictional soils. Results of the quantitative analyses were verified using a spread sheet program that applies Fellenius and the Simplified Bishop Methods of slices. A number of applications software have been developed for slope stability analyses, which have greatly reduced the rigor of manual computations, but these have little or no relevance for a student acquiring a foundational knowledge on slope stability analysis.This book will guide you through the step-by-step procedure of slope stability analysis, which may also help you in developing slope stability analysis user-written software.

Spectral lines, widths, and shapes are powerful tools for emitting/absorbing gas diagnostics in different astrophysical objects (from the solar system to the most distant objects in the universe--quasars). On the other hand, experimental and theoretical investigations of laboratory plasma have been applied in spectroscopic astrophysical research, especially in research on atomic data needed for line shape calculations. Data on spectral lines and their profiles are also important for diagnostics, analysis, and the modelling of fusion plasma, laser-produced plasma, laser design and development, and various plasmas in industry and technology, like light sources based on plasmas or the welding and piercing of metals by laser-produced plasma. The papers from this book can be divided into four groups: 1. stark broadening data for astrophysical and laboratory plasma investigations; 2. applications of spectral lines for astrophysical and laboratory plasma research; 3. spectral line phenomena in extragalactic objects, and 4. laboratory astrophysics results for spectra investigation. The reviews and research papers, representing new research on the topics presented in this book, are of interest for specialists and PhD students. We hope that the present book will be useful and interesting for scientists interested in the investigation of spectral line shapes and will contribute to the education of young researchers and PhD students.

The Royal Observatory at Greenwich is home to both time and space: Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the Prime Meridian. But have you ever stopped to ask what the Prime Meridian is, and why it's in Greenwich? Why are all time zones across the world based on GMT? What is the longitude? Why is the meridian moving?  A succinct history of the Meridian Line and its importance in defining international time standards, On the Line: The Story of the Greenwich Meridian breaks down complex topics in manageable articles, accompanied by eighty color illustrations and fun trivia to aid understanding. This insightful, concise guide reveals why international time standards are based around the Greenwich meridian--Longitude 0簞--where east meets west, and details the important discoveries made at Greenwich that led to time as we know it.

This is ""the Word"" -- one man's word, certainly -- about the art (and artifice) of the state of our computer-centric existence. And considering that the ""one man"" is Neal Stephenson, ""the hacker Hemingway"" (Newsweek) -- acclaimed novelist, pragmatist, seer, nerd-friendly philosopher, and nationally bestselling author of groundbreaking literary works (Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon,  etc., etc.) -- the word is well worth hearing. Mostly well-reasoned examination and partial rant, Stephenson's In the Beginning... was the Command Line is a thoughtful, irreverent, hilarious treatise on the cyber-culture past and present; on operating system tyrannies and downloaded popular revolutions; on the Internet, Disney World, Big Bangs, not to mention the meaning of life itself.

This book investigates the physical layer aspects of high-speed transmission on twisted-pair copper wires, where the most performance-critical components are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) precoding and multi-line spectrum optimization as well as optimized scheduling of the transmission time slots on the fiber to the distribution point (FTTdp) copper link. The book brings theoretical results into the implementation, which requires the introduction of realistic channel models and more practical implementation constraints as found in the copper access network. A good understanding of the transmission medium, twisted-pair telephone cable bundles is the basis for this work. Starting from the analysis of measurement data from twisted-pair cable bundles at high frequencies, it presents a MIMO channel model for the FTTdp network, which allows the characteristic effects of high-frequency transmission on copper cable bundles in simulation to be reproduced and the physical layer transmission methods on the copper channels to be analyzed and optimize. The book also presents precoding optimization for more general power constraints and implementation constraints. The maximization of data rate in a transmission system such as G.fast or VDSL is a combinatorial problem, as the rate is a discrete function of the number of modulated bits. Applying convex optimization methods to the problem offers an efficient and effective solution approach that is proven to operate close to the capacity of the FTTdp channel. In addition to higher data rates, low power consumption is another important aspect of the FTTdp network, as it requires many access nodes that are supplied with power from the subscriber side over the twisted- pair copper wires. Discontinuous operation is a method of quickly adding and removing lines from the precoding group. To implement this, the system switches between different link configurations over time at a high frequency. The transmission times of all lines are jointly optimized with respect to the current rate requirements. Discontinuous operation is used to save power, but also makes it possible to further increase the data rates, taking the current subscriber traffic requirements into account. These methods are compared with theoretical upper bounds, using realistic channel models and conditions of a system implementation. The performance analysis provides deeper insights into implementation complexity trade-offs and the resulting gap to channel capacity.

Within its pages you'll find general information about the Apollo Program, and detailed examinations of component Modules, Subsystems and Support, with special focus on the Command Module. ( A companion volume focusing on the LEM is also available.) Chapters include: Introduction, Saturn Launch Vehicles, Mission Description, The Moon and the History of Space Flight, Apollo Flight Tests, Command Module Overview, Service Module Overview, Lunar Module and SLA (Spacecraft-LM Adapter) Overview, Crew Accomodations, Displays and Controls, Docking Subsystem, Earth Landing Subsystem, Electrical Power Subsystem, Environmental Control Subsystem, Launch Escape Subsystem, Reaction Control Subsystem, Service Propulsion Subsystem, Telecommunications Subsystem, Stabilization and Control, Guidance and Navigation, Spacesuits, Final Testing, Safety, Reliability and Training, Apollo Manufacturing, Apollo Subcontractors, CSM Contract, Biographies, Apollo Chronology, Apollo Facts, Glossary, Abbreviations, Index. Although it may be one of the most complete studies of the systems and technology that made the """"giant leap"""" possible, it's never been easy to find copies of this text because copies were never widely released -- until now. This reprint is of an edition featuring a mission similar to Apollo 12, and features all the original text, diagrams and photos. It's a wonderful reference for the space flight fan, docent or engineering buff or for anyone else who ever wondered, """"How'd they do that!""""

Look beyond the basics of Mac programming and development to become a Mac power user. When most people think about the Mac, they think about the amazing graphical user interface macOS is known for. However, there is a whole world to explore beneath the hood. This book approaches working directly in the terminal with fun projects and ideas to help turn you into an advanced Mac user. You'll work with Brew (HomeBrew), which gives you the ability to install applications from Linux (and Unix) that can make the terminal more useful. This is important, because a lot of applications have been stripped out of macOS or deprecated. For example, Apple's built-in PHP is usually a major release behind. You'll also customize your terminal to change everything about it, making it your own. The whole world is about personalizing. Why put up with the Apple defaults? Once you have your terminal set up and ready to rock, you'll review the basics of programming on the Mac terminal. This will allow you to get a taste of power scripting. You'll discover the power of bash, PHP, and Python. And then you'll apply those tools to web development. Tweak Your Mac Terminal takes you on a journey into a world of the terminal and its hidden applications.  What You'll LearnCustomize the terminal to make it perfect for your needsDevelop web applications using basic coding skills in the terminalInstall HomeBrew and by extension Linux and Unix applicationsWho This Book Is ForMac users who are already very familiar with the GUI and want to go further. This book will especially help starting IT professionals and beginning programmers.

""In Fernanda Santos' expert hands, the story of 19 men and a raging wildfire unfolds as a riveting, pulse-pounding account of an American tragedy; and also as a meditation on manhood, brotherhood and family love. The Fire Line is a great and deeply moving book about courageous men and women.""- H矇ctor Tobar, author of Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine and the Miracle that Set Them Free.When a bolt of lightning ignited a hilltop in the sleepy town of Yarnell, Arizona, in June of 2013, setting off a blaze that would grow into one of the deadliest fires in American history, the twenty men who made up the Granite Mountain Hotshots sprang into action. An elite crew trained to combat the most challenging wildfires, the Granite Mountain Hotshots were a ragtag family, crisscrossing the American West and wherever else the fires took them. The Hotshots were loyal to one another and dedicated to the tough job they had. There's Eric Marsh, their devoted and demanding superintendent who turned his own personal demons into lessons he used to mold, train and guide his crew; Jesse Steed, their captain, a former Marine, a beast on the fire line and a family man who wasn't afraid to say ""I love you"" to the firemen he led; Andrew Ashcraft, a team leader still in his 20s who struggled to balance his love for his beautiful wife and four children and his passion for fighting wildfires. We see this band of brothers at work, at play and at home, until a fire that burned in their own backyards leads to a national tragedy.Impeccably researched, drawing upon more than a hundred hours of interviews with the firefighters' families, colleagues, state and federal officials, and fire historians and researchers, New York Times Phoenix Bureau Chief Fernanda Santos has written a riveting, pulse-pounding narrative of an unthinkable disaster, a remarkable group of men and the raging wildfires that threaten our country's treasured wild lands.The Fire Line is the winner of the 2017 Spur Award for Best First Nonfiction Book, and Spur Award Finalist for Best Western Contemporary Nonfiction.

An alternative guide to New York's beloved elevated parkPresented as an alternative survey of some of the curious aspects of New York's iconic High Line, this Field Guide by American artist Mark Dion (born 1961) provides an account of the wildlife, plants and insects that inhabit the space, as well as essays considering the social context and history of the site. Full of peculiar observations, rumors, speculations and mostly true facts, the Field Guide encourages viewers to question popular ideologies that define today's ""official"" history of the elevated park. It includes ""thoughts, musings and histories,"" such as a timeline of events on the High Line, a ""concise"" guide to the wildlife and illustrated guide to the plants of the area, Facts, Myths, & Rumors and even a Lost & Found section. Facts, Myths & Rumors is particularly illustrative of Dion's characteristic oscillation between fact and fiction. The section consists of a list of uncategorized statements, ranging from serious declarations (""the High Line once extended to Spring Street"") to more humorous musings (""the ghost of the West Side Cowboy has been seen and heard around the West 20th Street section of the park""). Dion leaves the viewer to separate truth from myth. Taken as a whole, the text encourages imagination and inquiry rather than dictating fact, asking the viewer to play a role in shaping his or her own version of history. Dion's Field Guide is a colorful introduction offering new perspective on the High Line.

""A wide range of topics are covered, from the equipment and training of the individual warriors to the overall structure of their campaigns. There is also an interesting section on the world view of the Viking warriors and their contemporaries."" --HistoryofWar.org  The Vikings had an extraordinary and far-reaching historical impact. From the eighth to the eleventh centuries, they ranged across Europe--raiding, exploring, colonizing--and their presence was felt as far away as Russia and Byzantium. They are most famous as warriors, yet perhaps their talent for warfare is too little understood. Philip Line, in this scholarly and highly readable study of the Viking age, uses original documentary sources--the chronicles, sagas, and poetry--and the latest archaeological evidence to describe how the Vikings and their enemies in northern Europe organized for war.  His graphic examination gives an up-to-date interpretation of the Vikings' approach to violence and their fighting methods that will be fascinating reading for anyone who is keen to understand how they operated and achieved so much in medieval Europe. He explores the practicalities of waging war in the Viking age, including compelling accounts of the nature of campaigns and raids, and detailed accounts of Viking-age battles on land and sea, using all the available evidence to give an insight into the experience of combat. Throughout this fascinating book, Philip Line seeks to dispel common myths about the Vikings and misconceptions about their approach to warfare.

 In our power-hungry world, all the talk about energy--what's safe and what's risky, what's clean and what's dirty, what's cheap and what's easy--tends to generate more heat than light. What, Julianne Couch wanted to know, is the real story on power production in this country? Approaching the question as a curious consumer, Couch takes us along as she visits nine sites where electrical power is developed from different fuel sources. From a geothermal plant in the Mojave Desert to a nuclear plant in Nebraska, from a Wyoming coal-fired power plant to a Maine tidal-power project, Couch gives us an insider's look at how power is generated, how it affects neighboring landscapes and the people who live and work there, and how each source comes with its own unique complications.The result is an informed, evenhanded discussion of energy production and consumption on the global, national, regional, local, and--most important--personal level. Knowledge is the real power this book imparts, allowing each of us to think beyond the flip of a switch to the real consequences of our energy use.Julianne Couch is an independent journalist and essayist. She is the author of Jukeboxes and Jackalopes: A Wyoming Bar Journey and Waking Up Western: Collected Essays.

The popular open source KDE desktop environment for Unix was built with Qt, a C]+ class library for writing GUI applications that run on Unix, Linux, Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, and Windows NT platforms. Qt emulates the look and feel of Motif, but is much easier to use. Best of all, after you have written an application with Qt, all you have to do is recompile it to have a version that works on Windows. Qt also emulates the look and feel of Windows, so your users get native-looking interfaces. Platform independence is not the only benefit. Qt is flexible and highly optimized. You'll find that you need to write very little, if any, platform-dependent code because Qt already has what you need. And Qt is free for open source and Linux development. Although programming with Qt is straightforward and feels natural once you get the hang of it, the learning curve can be steep. Qt comes with excellent reference documentation, but beginners often find the included tutorial is not enough to really get started with Qt. That's where Programming with Qt steps in. You'll learn how to program in Qt as the book guides you through the steps of writing a simple paint application. Exercises with fully worked out answers help you deepen your understanding of the topics. The book presents all of the GUI elements in Qt, along with advice about when and how to use them, so you can make full use of the toolkit. For seasoned Qt programmers, there's also lots of information on advanced 2D transformations, drag-and-drop, writing custom image file filters, networking with the new Qt Network Extension, XML processing, Unicode handling, and more. Programming with Qt helps you get the most out of this powerful, easy-to-use, cross-platform toolkit. It's been completely updated for Qt Version 3.0 and includes entirely new information on rich text, Unicode/double byte characters, internationalization, and network programming.

Qt程式設計
　Qt是一個用來寫GUI應用程式的C++類別函式庫，可以在Unix、Windows 95/98與Windows NT平台上執行一跨平台。Qt比Unix系統上標準的Motif工具組來得好用，同時Qt也作出了Motif的外觀感覺。

　當用Qt寫完應用程式，只要重新編譯後就有在Windows系統上的版本－可攜性。Qt也模擬了Windows的外觀感覺，所以可以提供所有使用者原來的視覺介面。

　除了使用者介面的類別之外，Qt對存取檔案系統、處理日期與時間以及網路程式設計都提供了可攜性的支援。有了Qt，會發現只要寫很少與平台相關的程式碼，因為Qt幾乎包括了所有需要的東西。

This doctrinal publication describes a theory and philosophy of command and control for the U.S. Marine Corps. Put very simply, the intent is to describe how we can reach effective military decisions and implement effective military actions faster than an adversary in any conflict setting on any scale. In so doing, this publication provides a framework for all Marines for the development and exercise of effective command and control in peace, in crisis, or in war. This publication represents a firm commitment by the Marine Corps to a bold, even fundamental shift in the way we will view and deal with the dynamic challenges of command and control in the information age. The Marine Corps' view of command and control is based on our common understanding of the nature of war and on our warfighting philosophy, as described in Fleet Marine Force Manual 1, Warfighting. It takes into account both the timeless features of war as we understand them and the implications of the ongoing information explosion that is a consequence of modern technology.

In 1728, William Byrd, the wealthy, English-educated master of Westover plantation, undertook a journey with a troop of commissioners, surveyors, and woodsmen to determine the exact boundary between North Carolina and Virginia. Byrd was not only an indefatigable explorer but also an amateur naturalist and diarist of considerable skill. He recorded the journey in two classics of colonial literature-- The History of the Dividing Line and The Secret History of the Line--which showcase in varying measure his keen observations of natural phenomena, his erudition, his predilection for exercise and sexual conquest, and his witty and elegant prose.William Byrd and Stephen Ausband are separated by almost three hundred years, but they share a similar literary inclination complemented by an amateur interest in nature. Like Byrd, Ausband has tramped the dividing line and returned with a lively, informative book. Byrd's Line is Ausband's dialogue with Byrd across the years. It still requires a hike or a four-wheel-drive vehicle to reach the remote beach where Byrd began his survey. As Ausband slogs through the Great Dismal Swamp and the thickets and forests that Byrd wrote about, he interlaces his own adventure with quotations from Byrd. These range from descriptions of chestnut trees and passenger pigeons, both gone now, to accounts of the local inhabitants, both native and European.Byrd often mused about what would happen to the land in the future. While some of the dividing line still feels like wilderness, it is crisscrossed today by bridges and roads, its forests felled and paved over for parking lots and subdivisions, its waters diverted or drained. Ausband's story, therefore, is a natural history of a changed region. It is also an accessible introduction to the mind and words of an extraordinary early American.

Gourmands and health-conscious consumers alike have fallen for fish; last year per capita consumption in the United States hit an all-time high. Packed with nutrients and naturally low in fat, fish is the last animal we can still eat in good conscience. Or can we?In this vivid, eye-opening book--first published in the UK to wide acclaim and now extensively revised for an American audience--environmental journalist Charles Clover argues that our passion for fish is unsustainable. Seventy-five percent of the world's fish stocks are now fully exploited or overfished; the most popular varieties risk extinction within the next few decades.Clover trawls the globe for answers, from Tokyo's sumptuous fish market to the heart of New England's fishing industry. He joins hardy sailors on high-tech boats, interviews top chefs whose menu selections can influence the fate of entire species, and examines the ineffective organizations charged with regulating the world's fisheries. Along the way he argues that governments as well as consumers can take steps to reverse this disturbing trend before it's too late. The price of a mouthwatering fillet of Chilean sea bass may seem outrageous, but The End of the Line shows its real cost to the ecosystem is far greater.
