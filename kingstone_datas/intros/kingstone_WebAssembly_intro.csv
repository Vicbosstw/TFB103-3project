Discover blueprints that explore various components of Blazor, C#, and .NET to help you build web apps without learning JavaScriptKey Features: Explore complete, easy-to-follow web projects using BlazorBuild projects such as a weather app, expense tracker, and Kanban board with real-world applicationsUnderstand and work with Blazor WebAssembly effectively without spending too much time focusing on the theoryBook Description: Blazor WebAssembly makes it possible to run C# code on the browser instead of having to use JavaScript, and does not rely on plugins or add-ons. The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project.You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order.By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#.What You Will Learn: Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web developmentUse the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly applicationUse templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog boxUnderstand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssemblyBuild a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speedUnderstand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart appGet to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager appWho this book is for: This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of the C# language, .NET framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, and web development concepts.

A a thorough, practice-based introduction to WebAssembly. Learn how to create high-performing, lightning-fast websites and applications.  WebAssembly is the fast, compact, portable technology that optimizes the performance of resource-intensive web applications and programs. The Art of WebAssembly is designed to give web developers a solid understanding of how it works, when to use it (and when not to), and how to develop and deploy WebAssembly apps. First you'll learn how to optimize and compile low-level code, debug and evaluate WebAssembly, and represent WebAssembly in the human-readable WebAssembly Text (WAT) format. Once you have the basics down, you'll build a browser-based collision detection program, work with browser rendering technologies to create graphics and animations, and see how WebAssembly interacts with other web languages. You'll also learn how to:  - Embed WebAssembly applications in web browsers and Node.js - Use browser debuggers to evaluate your WebAssembly code - Format variables, loops, functions, strings, data structures, and conditional logic in WAT - Manipulate memory - Build a program that generates graphical objects and detects when they collide - Evaluate the output of a WebAssembly compiler The Art of WebAssembly will help you make sense of this powerful technology to boost the performance of your web applications.
