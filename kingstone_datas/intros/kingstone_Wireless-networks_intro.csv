To cope with the rapid growth of mobile broadband traffic, various radio access technologies (e.g., HSPA, LTE, WiFi, and WiMAX) are being integrated and jointly managed. Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection, devoted to decide to what RAT mobiles should connect, is a key functionality to improve network performance and user experience. When intelligence is pushed to the network edge, mobiles make autonomous decisions regarding selection of their most appropriate RAT. They aim to selfishly maximize their utility. However, because mobiles have no information on network load conditions, their decisions may lead to performance inefficiency. Moreover, delegating decisions to the network optimizes overall performance, but at the cost of increased network complexity, signaling, and processing load. In this book, instead of favoring either of these decision-making approaches, we propose a hybrid decision framework: the network provides information for the mobiles to make robust RAT selections. More precisely, mobile users select their RAT depending on their individual needs and preferences, as well as on the monetary cost and QoS parameters signaled by the network.

Multi-hop wireless networks are usually defined as a collection of nodes equipped with radio transmitters, which not only have the capability to communicate each other in a multi-hop fashion, but also to route each others' data packets. The distributed nature of such networks makes them suitable for a variety of applications where there are no assumed reliable central entities, or controllers, and may significantly improve the scalability issues of conventional single-hop wireless networks. This book mainly investigates two aspects of the research issues related to the efficient multi-hop wireless networks designs, namely: network protocols and network management, both in cross-layer design paradigms to ensure the notion of service quality, i.e., quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) for backhaul applications and quality-of-information (QoI) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for sensing tasks. This book uses different network settings as illustrative examples to demonstrate the efficiency and correctness of the proposed algorithms, methodologies, protocols, and models with extensive simulation results, but they also have wide applicability to other networks.

Multihop Cellular Networks, Multihop Sensor Networks, and Multihop Cellular Sensor Networks are fast-emerging, utilitarian multihop mobile networking paradigms that promise increased transmission rates and network capacity. Multihop Mobile Wireless Networks discusses issues pertaining to each of these networks and proposes novel and innovative algorithms on Scheduling, Routing, and Data aggregation that are viable solutions for multihop mobile networks. Moreover, the book provides the preliminaries and an excellent review on existing approaches in wireless communications. Multihop Mobile Wireless Networks is suitable for academic and industrial research and can be used for advanced courses in senior undergraduate and graduate programs.The key findings of the book are: - Multihop Cellular Networks (MCN): These networks, as compared to the existing single-hop cellular networks, provide higher throughput and capacity at lower transmission power requirements by effective spectral re-use. This book proposes a novel route discovery and resilience protocol, as well as a probability of error based link Scheduling algorithm.- Multihop Sensor Networks (MSN): Wireless Sensor Networks are inherently multihop in nature due to the limited transmission range of resource-constrained sensor nodes. This book presents a novel multibit distributed data aggregation scheme, which minimizes in-network communication for an event detection application.- Multihop Cellular Sensor Networks (MCSN): Cell phones empowered with sensing capabilities have resulted in the emergence of Cellular Sensor Networks which can impact urban sensing applications in a profound sense. This book advocates multihopping in Cellular Sensor Networks and demonstrates its utility in a moving event localization application. Novel data aggregation and routing protocols that take into consideration the underlying mobility model and time-varying connectivity in MCSN are proposed.
