It has a power and sophistication that would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. For the sort of jobs it is ideal for, it has plenty of processing power and enough memory to make tasks that would have once required careful planning, relatively easy. Instead of struggling with the machine, you can now focus on getting a good implementation of your algorithms. To enjoy all of its power and sophistication there is no better language than C. It wastes none of the power and it gives you what you need to get at the new features. However, getting started with the Pico with C is no easy feat, which is what motivated this book about creating programs so that testing and debugging is easy.Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico in C uses the highly popular VS Code as its development environment and shows how to use a Raspberry Pi or a desktop PC running Windows as your development machine. The purpose of the book is to reveal what you can do with the Pico's GPIO lines together with widely used sensors, servos and motors and ADCs. After covering the GPIO, outputs and inputs, events and interrupts, it gives you hands-on experience of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), the SPI bus, the I2C bus and the 1-Wire bus. One of the key advantages of the Pico is its PIO (Programmable I\/O) and while this is an advanced feature it is included in this book. After finding out how the PIO works, we apply it to writing a PIO program for the DHT22 and the 1-Wire bus. One current drawback of the Pico it is that it doesn't have a network connection. To solve this problem there is a chapter on using the low-cost ESP8266 as a WiFi client and web server. The two devices together make the Pico a true IoT device. Harry Fairhead has a hardware background and, having worked with microprocessors and electronics in general, for many years, he is an enthusiastic proponent of the IoT and embedded computing. He is the author of two books intended for C programmers, Fundamental C: Getting Closer To The Machine and  Applying C For the IoT With Linux and four books on the using the Raspberry Pi in an IoT context, two using C and two using Python. He is now working on a Python version of this book for the Pico.\r\n                    \n"}

The criticality of wakes within wind farms is addressed by the addition of an entirely new chapter on wake effects, including 'engineering' wake models and wake control. Offshore, attention is focused for the first time on the design of floating support structures, and the new 'PISA' method for monopile geotechnical design is introduced. The coverage of blade design has been completely rewritten, with an expanded description of laminate fatigue properties and new sections on manufacturing methods, blade testing, leading-edge erosion and bend-twist coupling. These are complemented by new sections on blade add-ons and noise in the aerodynamics chapters, which now also include a description of the Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model and an extended introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis. The importance of the environmental impact of wind farms both on- and offshore is recognized by expanded coverage, and the requirements of the Grid Codes to ensure wind energy plays its full role in the power system are described. The conceptual design chapter has been extended to include a number of novel concepts, including low induction rotors, multiple rotor structures, superconducting generators and magnetic gearboxes. References and further reading resources are included throughout the book and have been updated to cover the latest literature. As in previous editions, the core subjects constituting the essential background to wind turbine and wind farm design are covered. These include:   The nature of the wind resource, including geographical variation, synoptic and diurnal variations, and turbulence characteristics The aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbines, including the actuator disc concept, rotor disc theory, the vortex cylinder model of the actuator disc and the Blade-Element\/Momentum theory Design loads for horizontal axis wind turbines, including the prescriptions of international standards Alternative machine architectures The design of key components Wind turbine controller design for fixed and variable speed machines The integration of wind farms into the electrical power system Wind farm design, siting constraints, and the assessment of environmental impact  Perfect for engineers and scientists learning about wind turbine technology, the Wind Energy Handbook will also earn a place in the libraries of graduate students taking courses on wind turbines and wind energy, as well as industry professionals whose work requires a deep understanding of wind energy technology.\r\n                    \n"}

Like an entertaining video game, programming is an often challenging but always rewarding experience. This book shakes off the dusty, dull, dryness of the typical programming book, replacing it with something more exciting and flavorful: a bit of humor, a casual tone, and examples involving dragons and asteroids instead of bank accounts and employees.And since you learn to program by doing instead of just reading, this book contains over 100 hands-on programming challenges. You will be building software instead of just reading about it. By completing the challenges, you'll earn experience points, level up, and become a True C# Programmer!This book covers the C# language from the ground up. It doesn't assume you've been programming for years, but it also doesn't hold back on exciting, powerful language features.The journey begins by getting you set up to program in C#.We will then explore the basic mechanics of C#: statements, expressions, variables, if statements, loops, and methods.Next, we dive deep into a powerful and central feature of C#: object-oriented programming, which is an essential tool needed to build larger programs.We then look at the advanced C# features that make the language unique, elegant, and powerful.With this book as your companion, you will soon be off to save the world (or take it over) with your own C# programs!\r\n                    \n"}

Research in this area has led to the discovery of many sophisticated facts, structures, ideas, relations, and applications. This deepening of knowledge, however, has also revealed more and more paradoxical differences between the structures of the two theories. The authors of this Research Note were driven by the quest to construct a theory in several complex variables that has the same structure as the one-variable theory. That is, they sought a reproducing kernel for the whole class that is universal and from same class. Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in Cm documents their success. Their highly original approach allowed them to obtain new results and refine some well-known results from the classical theory of several complex variables. The 'hyperholomorphic theory they developed proved to be a kind of direct sum of function theories for two Dirac-type operators of Clifford analysis considered in the same domain. In addition to new results and methods, this work presents a first-look at a brand new setting, based upon the natural language of differential forms, for complex analysis. Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in Cm reveals a deep link between the fields of several complex variables theory and Clifford analysis. It will have a strong influence on researchers in both areas, and undoubtedly will change the general viewpoint on the methods and ideas of several complex variables theory.\r\n                    \n"}

Bill Gates explains why he cares so deeply about climate change and what makes him optimistic that the world can avoid the most dire effects of the climate crisis. Gates says, We can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. His interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it. As a technologist, he has seen firsthand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways. According to Gates, to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe.\r\n                    \n"}

Organized in themed chapters, this book allows beginners to edsend the language even by reading the chapters in a different order from that proposed by the author. It is the result of several years of work at the ISO standardization committee level, and the following versions, namely C-14, 17 and 20, are only the result of this effort. It should be noted, however, that C-20 is still partially implemented by market compilers, whether It's Microsoft's Visual C, Clang (LLVM) or CCG. On the cloud, everything is Server oriented and Linux reigns supreme. Whether it's multithread or asynchronous programming, with Docker or Azure, it's all about high-availability or hyper-scalabl environments.\r\n                    \n"}

The book is suitable for developers with a basic knowledge of C++. Developers familiar with mainstream deep learning frameworks can also refer to this book to compare the differences between the deep learning framework implemented with metaprogramming and compile-time computing with deep learning frameworks using object-oriented methods. Consisting of eight chapters, the book starts with two chapters discussing basic techniques of metaprogramming and compile-time computing. The rest of the book's chapters focus on the practical application of metaprogramming in a deep learning framework. It examines rich types and systems, expression templates, and writing complex meta-functions, as well as such topics as:    Heterogeneous dictionaries and policy templates   An introduction to deep learning   Type system and basic data types   Operations and expression templates   Basic layers   Composite and recurrent layers   Evaluation and its optimization  Metaprogramming can construct flexible and efficient code. For C++ developers who are familiar with object-oriented programming, the main difficulty in learning and mastering C++ metaprogramming is establishing the thinking mode of functional programming. The meta-programming approach involved at compile time is functional, which means that the intermediate results of the construction cannot be changed, and the impact may be greater than expected. This book enables C++ programmers to develop a functional mindset and metaprogramming skills. The book also discusses the development cost and use cost of metaprogramming and provides workarounds for minimizing these costs.\r\n                    \n"}

It highlights the ways in which time and space matter, framing individual actions and practices and their impact on larger urban processes.It draws on the original and detailed studies of cities in Europe and North America through a micro-geographical approach to unravel urban practices, experiences and representations at three different scales: the dwelling, the street and the neighbourhood. Part I explores the changing spatiality of housing, examining the complex and contingent relationship between public and private, and commercial and domestic, as well as the relationship between representations and lived experiences. Part II delves into the street as a thoroughfare, connecting the city, but also as a site of contestation over the control and character of urban spaces. Part III draws attention to the neighbourhood as a residential grouping and as a series of spaces connecting flows of people integrating the urban space. Drawing on a range of methodologies, from space syntax and axial analysis to detailed descriptions of individual buildings, this book blends spatial theory and ideas of place with micro-history. With its fresh perspectives on the Western city created through the built environment and the everyday actions of city dwellers, the book will interest historical geographers, urban historians and architects involved in planning of cities across Europe and North America.\r\n                    \n"}

Adam Thorpe's home for the past 25 years has been an old house in the C矇vennes, a wild range of mountains in southern France. Prior to this, in an ancient millhouse in the oxbow of a C矇venol river, he wrote the novel that would become the Booker Prize-nominated Ulverton, now a Vintage Classic. In more recent writing Thorpe has explored the C矇vennes, drawing on the legends, history and above all the people of this part of France for his inspiration. In his charming journal,  Notes from the C矇vennes, Thorpe takes up these themes, writing about his surroundings, the village and his house at the heart of it, as well as the contrasts of city life in nearby N簾mes. In particular he is interested in how the past leaves impressions--marks--on our landscape and on us. What do we find in the grass, earth and stone beneath our feet and in the objects around us? How do they tie us to our forebears? What traces have been left behind and what marks do we leave now? Part celebration of both rustic and urban France, part memoir, Thorpe's humorous and precise prose shows a wonderful stylist at work, recalling classics such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Travels with a Donkey in the C矇vennes.\r\n                    \n"}

Data parallelism in C++ enables access to parallel resources in a modern heterogeneous system, freeing the programmer from being locked into any particular computing device. Now a single C++ application can use any combination of devices--including GPUs, CPUs, FPGAs and AI ASICs--that are suitable to the problems at hand. This book teaches data-parallel programming using C++ and the SYCL standard from the Khronos Group, and walks through everything needed to use SYCL for programming heterogeneous systems. SYCL programs perform best when paired with SYCL-aware C++ compilers such as the open source Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) compiler used in this book. The material in this book is approachable to both those new to data-parallel programming and seasoned parallel programming veterans. It is full of practical advice, detailed explanations, and code examples to illustrate key topics. This book begins by introducing data parallelism and foundational topics for effective use of SYCL and DPC++. Later chapters cover advanced topics including error handling, hardware-specific programming, communication and synchronization, and memory model considerations. This open access book enables C++ programmers to be at the forefront of this exciting and important new development that is helping to push computing to new levels.  What You'll Learn How to accelerate C++ programs using data-parallel programming How to target multiple device types (e.g. CPU, GPU, FPGA) How to use SYCL and SYCL compilers How to connect with computing's heterogeneous future via Intel's oneAPI initiative   Who This Book Is For Computer programmers interested in data-parallel programming using C++. \n\n"}

But to put it to good use in IoT you need two areas of expertise, electronics and programming and, because of the way hardware and software engineering tend to occupy separate niches, you may need help with combining the two. This book teaches you to think like an IoT programmer.In Raspberry Pi IoT in C you will find a practical approach to understanding electronic circuits and datasheets and translating this to code, specifically using the C programming language. The main reason for choosing C is speed, a crucial factor when you are writing programs to communicate with the outside world. If you are familiar with another programming language, C shouldn't be hard to pick up. This Second Edition has been brought up-to-date and focuses mainly on the Pi 4 and the Pi Zero. There is new material on the recently introduced GPIO character driver and using the Pi 4's additional ports and scheduling.Although NetBeans is used to develop programs, VS Code is now considered an alternative remote development environment and all the book's code, which is available for download, has been tested with VS Code.The main idea in this book is to not simply install a driver, but to work directly with the hardware using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) to connect with off-the-shelf sensors. It explains how to use its standard output with custom protocols, including an in-depth exposition of the 1-wire bus. You will also discover how to put the Internet into the IoT using sockets.After reading this book you will be in a better position to tackle interfacing anything-with-anything without the need for custom drivers and prebuilt hardware modules.Harry Fairhead has worked with microprocessors and electronics in general for many years and is an enthusiastic proponent of the IoT. As well as being the Editor of IoT-Programmer.com, he is a regular contributor to I-Programmer.info, where he covers all aspects of hardware. His other recent books include Applying C For The IoT With Linux as well as  Fundamental C: Getting Closer To The Machine and Micro: bit IoT in C.\r\n                    \n"}

Written for those with minimal or no programming experience, Computer Programming in C for Beginners offers a heavily guided, hands-on approach that enables the reader to quickly start programming, and then progresses to cover the major concepts of C programming that are critical for an early stage programmer to know and understand. While the progression of topics is conventional, their treatment is innovative and designed for rapid understanding of the many concepts in C that have traditionally proven difficult for beginners, such as variable typing and scope, function definition, passing by value, pointers, passing by reference, arrays, structures, basic memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists, as well as an introductory treatment of searching and sorting algorithms. Written in an informal but clear narrative, the book uses extensive examples throughout and provides detailed guidance on how to write the C code to achieve the objectives of the example problems. Derived from the author's many years of teaching hands-on college courses, it encourages the reader to follow along by programming the progressively more complex exercise programs presented. In some sections, errors are purposely inserted into the code to teach the reader about the common pitfalls of programming in general, and the C language in particular.\r\n                    \n"}

However, it is predicted from history that new antimicrobials will have a short life. Thus, resistance to new drugs leads to a shortage of antimicrobials as the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs is not enough to cope with the fast emergence of resistant strains. This requires new potent antimicrobial compounds as an alternative to existing antibiotics. Phytochemicals having a low molecular weight, could be an alternative source of antimicrobials. Natural molecules are a more promising source of drugs. Natural molecules have a diverse chemical structure and biochemical specificity. Biologically active natural molecules usually have low molecular weight; they are easily absorbed and metabolized in the body. Major resources of natural molecules include plants, marine organisms and microbes. The plant produces innumerable secondary metabolites with several biological activities. Hence, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of plants for the development of new therapeutic agents.\r\n                    \n"}

Among other variables, soil degradation by fire affects the dynamics of organic matter, which can substantially change its quantity and quality in short and long term. The humic substances, whose most important components are fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA) are the most resistant fractions to biodegradation. These fractions play a fundamental role in the soil through their chemical reactivity. The objective of this work was to analyze the changes in the chemical and physical-chemical properties of HA extracted from fire-affected soils, with extensive crops (soybeans and corn) and native forests without intervention. The information obtained, with different methodologies, shows the influence on the soil properties, of the different surface vegetable residues present at the fire event.\r\n                    \n"}

There is little information about molecular epidemiology of HCV isolates in Morocco, an area known for an intermediate prevalence of HCV infection. The aim of this study was to determine the subtype distribution of HCV strains in patients with chronic HCV infection in Morocco and to estimate the prevalence of amino acid substitutions in the HCV core region in treatment-naive patients from Morocco. In this study, we have included 185 anti-HCV positive patients. The identification of HCV subtype was respectively performed by sequencing of the 5'UTR, core and NS5B regions. HCV demographic history was inferred using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on NS5B region revealed that subtype 1b (75.2%) was the most common followed by subtype 2i (19.1%). HCV subtype 1b had an even higher prevalence in hepatocellular carcinoma. Using a Bayesian approach, the mean date of appearance of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be 1910 for HCV-1b and 1854 for HCV-2i. Based on core region, mutations at R70Q or L91M were detected in more than one fourth of patients infected with HCV-1b.\r\n                    \n"}

Methylcytosine (5mC) and hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are the main covalent modifications of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are maintained by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) enzymes. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for the TET enzymes and when a deficiency presents it results in a disruption of the methylation\/demethylation dynamics. In this work, retinal cells are cultured either in a deficiency or sufficiency of vitamin C and the hydroxymethylome and transcriptome are investigated. The most interesting finding is that a deficiency of vitamin C leads to an overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has long been implicated in diabetic eye complications. This suggests that a correction of the local vitamin C deficiency could prevent or possibly even ameliorate symptoms of diabetic retinopathy.\r\n                    \n"}

Nitrogen and carbon is an essential nutrient element for organisms and is a key factor controlling plant growth and soil microbial activity in most terrestrial ecosystems. In general, plant growth and microbial activity are limited by low availability of N and C, especially in terrestrial ecosystems where low temperature restricts N and C mineralization and where most N is trapped in soil organic forms that are unavailable to plants. Agroforestry is helpful to stimulate these ecosystem services. Therefore, knowledge of N retention and turnover processes in soil and the factors controlling these processes are very important to better understand terrestrial N and C cycle and its potential response to global change.\r\n                    \n"}
