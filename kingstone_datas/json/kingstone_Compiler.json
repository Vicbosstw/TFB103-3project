This book covers the theory behind machine learning models and shows you how to program and assemble a voice-controlled security.You'll learn the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and how the nuts-and-bolts of a neural network actually work. You'll also learn to identify and measure the metrics that tell how well your classifier is doing. An overview of other types of machine learning techniques, such as genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, support vector machines, and anomaly detectors will get you up and running with a familiarity of basic machine learning concepts. Chapters focus on the best practices to build models that can actually scale and are flexible enough to be embedded in multiple applications and easily reusable.With those concepts covered, you'll dive into the tools for setting up a network to collect and process the data points to be fed to our models by using some of the ubiquitous and cheap pieces of hardware that make up today's home automation and IoT industry, such as the RaspberryPi, Arduino, ESP8266, etc. Finally, you'll put things together and work through a couple of practical examples. You'll deploy models for detecting the presence of people in your house, and anomaly detectors that inform you if some sensors have measured something unusual. And you'll add a voice assistant that uses your own model to recognize your voice.

The performance of CITRA algorithm was tested on different convective storms and it could successfully identify and track them along with other physical properties of the convective cells.

Timely maintenance of roads helps in lowering rehabilitation costs, accidents, environmental pollution, while facilitating increased connectivity, trade, and growth. Easily acquirable front-view scene images are seen to be used lately for infrastructure management and road maintenance as they provide quicker, low-cost, and flexible solutions. Such scene images can easily be acquired using standard commodity cameras. In this dissertation, machine learning based approaches have been developed to analyze front-view scene images for detecting cracks automatically on road surfaces across different locations and under various conditions. This work thus contributes toward automated approaches to detect different kinds of cracks on road surfaces, thereby proposing a low-cost solution to road maintenance practices. As a result, different components are developed in this work which are sketched together to form a Decision Support System for the task of crack detection. In this study primarily three algorithmic approaches have been developed. Firstly, an unsupervised graph-based hierarchical clustering technique for road area segmentation has been developed, thus helping in detecting the road area in scene images. Secondly, a classifier and superpixel based supervised learning approach consisting of systematically identifying relevant features for detecting superpixels containing cracks has been developed. Thirdly, an unsupervised learning approach consisting of Gamma Mixture Fuzzy Model based clustering technique and keypoint matching mechanisms have been designed in this work for detecting which road pixels are crack pixels in images. Finally, this study integrates the findings and approaches to propose a Decision Support System for crack detection on road surfaces of easily acquirable front-view scene images. Evaluations performed on an experimentally collected diverse front-view scene\r\n                    \r\n"}

Covering complex topics in an easy-to-understand way, without requiring any prior knowledge in the field, the book provides a concise review of the key methodologies in computer vision for solving important problems in industrial radiology. The theoretical coverage is supported by numerous examples, each of which can be tested and evaluated by the reader using a freely-available Matlab toolbox and X-ray image database.Topics and features: introduces the mathematical background for monocular and multiple view geometry, which is commonly used in X-ray computer vision systems; describes the main techniques for image processing used in X-ray testing, including image filtering, edge detection, image segmentation and image restoration; presents a range of different representations for X-ray images, explaining how these enable new features to be extracted from the original image; examines a range of known X-ray image classifiers and classification strategies, and techniques for estimating the accuracy of a classifier; discusses some basic concepts for the simulation of X-ray images, and presents simple geometric and imaging models that can be used in the simulation; reviews a variety of applications for X-ray testing, from industrial inspection and baggage screening to the quality control of natural products; provides supporting material at an associated website, including a database of X-ray images and a Matlab toolbox for use with the book's many examples.This classroom-tested and hands-on guide is ideal for graduate and advanced undergraduate students interested in the practical application of image processing, pattern recognition and computer vision techniques for non-destructive quality testing and security inspection.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Wheat production is influenced by assorted varying factors. A basic requisite for best production is the seed. Sorting or grading of agricultural products influenced by computer varies product wise and even product variety wise which changes region wise. Grading for new varieties released by the agricultural scientist is the major concerned as new varieties are produced by crossing existing varieties and for these proven optimized machine learning algorithms may give an adverse result. This book highlights various applications of image processing in agriculture and introduces a machine learning algorithm capable of classifying major 5 wheat cultivars (TRITICUM - DURUM: GDW 1255 (released in 2013 by ICAR) & TRITICUM - AESTVIUM: GW 273, GW 322, GW 496 & LOK 1) cultivated in Gujarat region. Experimental data consist of 11 traits comprised of shape, color & morphological characteristics. After applying feature selection algorithm,5 traits were considered & LM backpropagation was used to classify above wheat cultivars which ensued to more than 90.0% accuracy.\r\n                    \r\n"}
