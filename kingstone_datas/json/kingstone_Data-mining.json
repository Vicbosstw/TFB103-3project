Graph data mining is used to discover useful information and knowledge from graph data. The complications of nodes, links and the semi-structure form present challenges in terms of the computation tasks, e.g., node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. In this context, various advanced techniques, including graph embedding and graph neural networks, have recently been proposed to improve the performance of graph data mining.  This book provides a state-of-the-art review of graph data mining methods. It addresses a current hot topic - the security of graph data mining - and proposes a series of detection methods to identify adversarial samples in graph data. In addition, it introduces readers to graph augmentation and subgraph networks to further enhance the models, i.e., improve their accuracy and robustness. Lastly, the book describes the applications of these advanced techniques in various scenarios, such as traffic networks, social and technical networks, and blockchains. \r\n\r\n"}

First step of Data mining is tracking patterns in which data mining is learning to recognize patterns in data sets. Classification is the second step in data mining which is a more complex data mining technique that forces users to collect various attributes. Association is related to tracking patterns, but is more specific to dependently linked variables. Outlier detection simply recognizing the overarching pattern can't give a clear understanding of the data set which is regarded as the third step in data mining. Next Step in data mining in Clustering is very similar to classification, but involves grouping chunks of data together based on their similarities. Regression, used primarily as a form of planning and modeling, is used to identify a certain variable, given the presence of other variables. Final step of the data mining technique is Prediction.

Data mining is now playing a significant role in seeking a decision support to draw higher profits by the modern business world. Various researchers studied the benefits of data mining processes and its adoption by business organizations, but very few of them have discussed the success factors of decision support projects. The Research Hypothesis states the involvement of the decision tree while adopting accuracy of classification and while emphasizing the impact factor or importance of the attributes rather than the information gain. The concept of involvement of impact factor rather than just accuracy can be utilized in developing the new algorithm whose performance improves over the existing algorithms. We proposed a new algorithm which improves accuracy and contributing effectively in decision tree learning. We presented an algorithm that resolves the above stated problem of confliction of class. We have introduced the impact factor and classified impact factor to resolve the conflict situation. We have used data mining technique in facilitating the decision support with improved performance over its existing companion. We have also addressed the unique problem which have not been addressed before. Definitely, the fusion of data mining and decision support can contribute to problem-solving by enabling the vast hidden knowledge from data and knowledge received from experts. We have discussed a lot of work done in the field of decision support and hierarchical multi-attribute decision models.

Learning is a continuous process since human evolution. In fact, it is related to life and innovations. The basic objective of learning to grow, aspire and develop ease of life remains the same despite changes in the learning methodologies. Introduction of computers empowered us to attain new zenith in knowledge domain, developed pragmatic approach to solve life's problem and helped us to decipher different hidden patterns of data to get new ideas. Of late, computers are predominantly used in education. Its process has been changed from offline to online in view of enhancing the ease of learning. With the advent of information technology, e-learning has taken centre stage in educational domain. In e-learning context, developing adaptive e-learning system is buzzword among contemporary research scholars in the area of Educational Data Mining (EDM). Enabling personalized systems is meant for improvement in learning experience for learners as per their choices made or auto-detected needs. It helps in enhancing their performance in terms of knowledge, skills, aptitudes and preferences. It also enables speeding up the learning process qualitatively and quantitatively. These objectives are met only by the Personalized Adaptive E-learning Systems in this regard. Many noble frameworks were conceptualized, designed and developed to infer learning style preferences, and accordingly, learning materials were delivered adaptively to the learners. Designing frameworks help to measure learners' preferences minutely and provide adaptive learning materials to them in a way most appropriately.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In many predictive modeling tasks, one has a fixed set of observations from which a vast, or even infinite, set of potentially predictive features can be com-puted. Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be use-ful in a predictive model. Models which use the entire set of features will almost certainly overfit on future data sets. The book presents streamwise feature selection which interleaves the pro-cess of generating new features with that of feature testing. Streamwise fea-ture selection scales well to large feature sets. The book also describes how to use streamwise feature seleciton in multivariate regressions. It includes a review of traditional feature selecitions in a general frame-work based on information theory, and compares these methods with streamwise feature selection on various real and synthetic data sets. This book is intended to be used by researchers in machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery.\r\n                    \r\n"}

With the advent of inexpensive storage space and faster processing over the past decade, data mining research has start to penetrate new grounds in areas of speech and audio processing. A typical speech can be broadly defined as speech with emotional content, speech affected by alcohol and drugs, speech from speakers with disabilities, and various kind of pathological speech. Individual speech can vary because of different timing and amplitude of the movement of speech articulation. Physical mechanism of speech undergoes changes, which can affect the nasal cavity resonance and mode of vibrations of the vocal cords. A series of environmental variables like background noise, reverberation and recording condition have also to be taken into account. In essence every speech production is unique and this uniqueness makes the automatic speech processing quite difficult.\r\n                    \r\n"}

As a serious data miner you will often be faced with thousands of candidate features for your prediction or classification application, with most of the features being of little or no value. You'll know that many of these features may be useful only in combination with certain other features while being practically worthless alone or in combination with most others. Some features may have enormous predictive power, but only within a small, specialized area of the feature space. The problems that plague modern data miners are endless. This book helps you solve this problem by presenting modern feature selection techniques and the code to implement them. Some of these techniques are: Forward selection component analysis Local feature selection Linking features and a target with a hidden Markov model Improvements on traditional stepwise selection Nominal-to-ordinal conversion All algorithms are intuitively justified and supported by the relevant equations and explanatory material. The author also presents and explains complete, highly commented source code.  The example code is in C++ and CUDA C but Python or other code can be substituted; the algorithm is important, not the code that's used to write it.  What You Will Learn  Combine principal component analysis with forward and backward stepwise selection to identify a compact subset of a large collection of variables that captures the maximum possible variation within the entire set. Identify features that may have predictive power over only a small subset of the feature domain. Such features can be profitably used by modern predictive models but may be missed by other feature selection methods. Find an underlying hidden Markov model that controls the distributions of feature variables and the target simultaneously. The memory inherent in this method is especially valuable in high-noise applications such as prediction of financial markets. Improve traditional stepwise selection in three ways: examine a collection of 'best-so-far' feature sets; test candidate features for inclusion with cross validation to automatically and effectively limit model complexity; and at each step estimate the probability that our results so far could be just the product of random good luck. We also estimate the probability that the improvement obtained by adding a new variable could have been just good luck. Take a potentially valuable nominal variable (a category or class membership) that is unsuitable for input to a prediction model, and assign to each category a sensible numeric value that can be used as a model input.   Who This Book Is For  Intermediate to advanced data science programmers and analysts. C++ and CUDA C experience is highly recommended. However, this book can be used as a framework using other languages such as Python.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In Data Mining for Global Trends in Mountain Biodiversity,  Christian Korner, Eva M. Spehn, and a team of experts from the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment of DIVERSITAS explore two of the hottest subjects in science and technology: biodiversity and data mining. They demonstrate how to harness the scientific power of biological databases for furthering ecological and evolutionary theory. Expert contributors address two aspects of the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment. They cover how to link biodiversity data with geophysical data and how to use biodiversity data to substantiate evolutionary and ecological theory. The text provides different methodological approaches and examples of successful mining of geo-referenced data in mountain regions on various scales. It includes:    Elevational and latitudinal gradients in plant diversity E-mining trends in diversity of Lepidoptera, beetles, and birds Niche modeling to explain past trends and predict future trends in mountain biodiversity Sharing biodiversity data with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility Using electronic databases opens ways to manage biodiversity in a sustainable fashion, test evolutionary and ecological theories, and measure the impact of climate change on various species and its effect on conservation efforts. The information and examples presented in this book can stimulate the creative use of archive data to answer old questions with new tools, and advance knowledge and understanding of mountain biodiversity worldwide. The book highlights the benefits of and the continuing need for an increase in the amount and quality of georeferenced data provided online in order to meet the challenges of global change.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It offers a systematic and practical overview of spatial data mining, which combines computer science and geo-spatial information science, allowing each field to profit from the knowledge and techniques of the other. To address the spatiotemporal specialties of spatial data, the authors introduce the key concepts and algorithms of the data field, cloud model, mining view, and Deren Li methods. The data field method captures the interactions between spatial objects by diffusing the data contribution from a universe of samples to a universe of population, thereby bridging the gap between the data model and the recognition model. The cloud model is a qualitative method that utilizes quantitative numerical characters to bridge the gap between pure data and linguistic concepts. The mining view method discriminates the different requirements by using scale, hierarchy, and granularity in order to uncover the anisotropy of spatial data mining. The Deren Li method performs data preprocessing to prepare it for further knowledge discovery by selecting a weight for iteration in order to clean the observed spatial data as much as possible. In addition to the essential algorithms and techniques, the book provides application examples of spatial data mining in geographic information science and remote sensing. The practical projects include spatiotemporal video data mining for protecting public security, serial image mining on nighttime lights for assessing the severity of the Syrian Crisis, and the applications in the government project 'the Belt and Road Initiatives'.\r\n\r\n"}

He then looks toward the implications of intelligent 'conscious' humanoid robots with superior intellects, able to operate in our human environments. After presenting the basic engineering components and supporting logic of computer systems, and giving an overview of the contributions of pioneering scientists in the domains of computing, logic, and robotics, in the core of the book the author examines the meaning of thought and intelligence in the context of specific tasks and successful AI approaches. In the final part of the book he introduces related societal and ethical implications.The book will be a useful accompanying text in courses on artificial intelligence, robotics, intelligent systems, games, and evolutionary computing. It will also be valuable for general readers and historians of technology.\r\n\r\n"}

It could change the face of data mining and machine learning, as well as constraint programming technology. It would not only allow one to use data mining techniques in constraint programming to identify and update constraints and optimization criteria, but also to employ constraints and criteria in data mining and machine learning in order to discover models compatible with prior knowledge.  This book reports on some key results obtained on this integrated and cross- disciplinary approach within the European FP7 FET Open project no. 284715 on \"Inductive Constraint Programming\" and a number of associated workshops and Dagstuhl seminars. The book is structured in five parts: background; learning to model; learning to solve; constraint programming for data mining; and showcases. \r\n\r\n"}
