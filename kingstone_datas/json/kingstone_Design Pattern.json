The pattern detector is based on a template using a grid of weights with a fixed size. The template takes in consideration not only the closing price but also the open, high, and low values of the price during the period under testing in contrast to the traditional methods of analysing only the closing price. Each cell of the grid encompasses a score, and these are optimized by an evolutionary genetic algorithm that takes genetic diversity into consideration through a speciation routine, giving time for each individual of the population to be optimized within its own niche. With this method, the system is able to present better results and improves the results compared with other template approaches. The tests considered real data from the stock market and against state-of-the-art solutions, namely the ones using a grid of weights which does not have a fixed size and non-speciated approaches. During the testing period, the presented solution had a return of 21.3% compared to 10.9% of the existing approaches. The use of speciation was able to increase the returns of some results as genetic diversity was taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n"}

However, this book is specifically intended to students and researchers of pattern information processing, analyzing signals such as images and exploring computer vision and computer graphics applications. The author himself is a researcher of this domain. Such pattern information processing deals with a large amount of data, which are represented by high-dimensional vectors and matrices. There, the role of linear algebra is not merely numerical computation of large-scale vectors and matrices. In fact, data processing is usually accompanied with \"geometric interpretation.\" For example, we can think of one data set being \"orthogonal\" to another and define a \"distance\" between them or invoke geometric relationships such as \"projecting\" some data onto some space. Such geometric concepts not only help us mentally visualize abstract high-dimensional spaces in intuitive terms but also lead us to find what kind of processing is appropriate for what kind of goals. First, we take up the concept of \"projection\" of linear spaces and describe \"spectral decomposition,\" \"singular value decomposition,\" and \"pseudoinverse\" in terms of projection. As their applications, we discuss least-squares solutions of simultaneous linear equations and covariance matrices of probability distributions of vector random variables that are not necessarily positive definite. We also discuss fitting subspaces to point data and factorizing matrices in high dimensions in relation to motion image analysis. Finally, we introduce a computer vision application of reconstructing the 3D location of a point from three camera views to illustrate the role of linear algebra in dealing with data with noise. This book is expected to help students and researchers of pattern information processing deepen the geometric understanding of linear algebra.\r\n                    \r\n"}

A survey of the classical models in the fields with up to date applications is given.  The book begins with detailed description of how spatial dynamics\/diffusive processes influence the dynamics of biological populations. These processes play a key role in understanding the outbreak and spread of pandemics which help us in designing the control strategies from the public health perspective. A brief discussion on the functional mechanism of the brain (single neuron models and network level) with classical models of neuronal dynamics in space and time is given. Relevant phenomena and existing modeling approaches in ecology, epidemiology and neuroscience are introduced, which provide examples of pattern formation in these models. The analysis of patterns enables us to study the dynamics of macroscopic and microscopic behaviour of underlying systems and travelling wave type patterns observed in dispersive systems. Moving on to virus dynamics, authors present a detailed analysis of different types models of infectious diseases including two models for influenza, five models for Ebola virus and seven models for Zika virus with diffusion and time delay. A Chapter is devoted for the study of Brain Dynamics (Neural systems in space and time). Significant advances made in modeling the reaction-diffusion systems are presented and spatiotemporal patterning in the systems is reviewed. Development of appropriate mathematical models and detailed analysis (such as linear stability, weakly nonlinear analysis, bifurcation analysis, control theory, numerical simulation) are presented. Key Features   Covers the fundamental concepts and mathematical skills required to analyse reaction-diffusion models for biological populations.   Concepts are introduced in such a way that readers with a basic knowledge of differential equations and numerical methods can understand the analysis. The results are also illustrated with figures.    Focuses on mathematical modeling and numerical simulations using basic conceptual and classic models of population dynamics, Virus and Brain dynamics.   Covers wide range of models using spatial and non-spatial approaches.   Covers single, two and multispecies reaction-diffusion models from ecology and models from bio-chemistry. Models are analysed for stability of equilibrium points, Turing instability, Hopf bifurcation and pattern formations.   Uses Mathematica for problem solving and MATLAB for pattern formations.   Contains solved Examples and Problems in Exercises.  The Book is suitable for advanced undergraduate, graduate and research students. For those who are working in the above areas, it provides information from most of the recent works. The text presents all the fundamental concepts and mathematical skills needed to build models and perform analyses.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The number of possible patterns that can be identified relative to the number that are genuinely useful has grown exponentially - which means that the chances that a discovered pattern is useful is rapidly approaching zero. Patterns in data are often used as evidence, but how can you tell if that evidence is worth believing? We are hard-wired to notice patterns and to think that the patterns we notice are meaningful. Streaks, clusters, and correlations are the norm, not the exception. Our challenge is to overcome our inherited inclination to think that all patterns are significant, as in this age of Big Data patterns are inevitable and usually coincidental. Through countless examples, The Phantom Pattern Problem is an engaging read that helps us avoid being duped by data, tricked into worthless investing strategies, or scared out of getting vaccinations.\r\n\r\n"}

It devotes three chapters to review the background and basic knowledge, four chapters to discuss specific types of cryptographic primitive design for blockchain, one chapter to discuss optimization tools and another chapter for blockchain regulation and economies. This book covers the systematic survey of research objects, as well as detailed reviews of cryptographic schemes, lectures and methodologies to practice cryptography.The main findings of this book are summarized as following, first, the practical design and analysis of cryptographic schemes for blockchain can address major problems in blockchain at algorithmic level. Then, some intrinsic deficiencies in some traditional cryptographic primitives, like centralized setup, impractical design, etc, prevent the successful application of these primitives in blockchain. However, huge efforts are being made to make these primitives practical and applicable for researchers. Finally, the formal and rigorous design and analysis of public key cryptographic algorithms is vital to blockchain. Design and Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms in Blockchain is a useful textbook for graduate students and PhD students, or researches who wish to connect cryptography with blockchain for research and developing projects.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In the 1990s, Dr. Cockburn was one of the leading methodologists in the new area of object-oriented design. Hired by the IBM Consulting Group to create their methodology for object-technology projects, he taught the entire design team on a live project all they would need to know to run the project they were embarking on. This book is that course. Offering a rare glimpse into a moment in time where the standards and practices of object technology were being chartered by the leaders of the day, this book gives an unfiltered look into the approach and techniques used to educate practitioners. Now, in 2021, that course has historical significance. It was at the time a tour-de-force of complete project education, from project management tips to requirements gathering to software design. It set the stage for modern \"agile\" development techniques. Old-timers will enjoy seeing the presentation of these core topics.

Besides, the field of numerical methods and artificial intelligence is experiencing a surge of new methods and the refinement of existing ones to expand opportunities to apply robust formulations to complex engineering problems. Today, more than ever, the field is receiving fresh ideas on how to face the challenges of finding a balance between cost and benefits that may lead towards the optimal design of systems. Recently, the probability density evolution method (PDEM) was proposed by Prof. Jie Li as an alternative way to obtain the stochastic and dynamic solution of the safety level of engineering systems under any kind of hazard. This work deals with the application of this powerful method to derive optimal design recommendations for large engineering systems under natural hazards. The three case studies illustrate to engineers and academic specialists how to strike a cost-effective balance in designing such systems.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This book starts with recognizable questions in Design Research, such as A\/B testing, how users learn to operate a device and why computer-generated faces are eerie. Using a broad range of examples, efficient research designs are presented together with statistical models and many visualizations. With the tidy R approach, producing publication-ready statistical reports is straight-forward and even non-programmers can learn this in just one day. Hundreds of illustrations, tables, simulations and models are presented with full R code and data included. Using Bayesian linear models, multi-level models and generalized linear models, an extensive statistical framework is introduced, covering a huge variety of research situations and yet, building on only a handful of basic concepts. Unique solutions to recurring problems are presented, such as psychometric multi-level models, beta regression for rating scales and ExGaussian regression for response times. A \"think-first\" approach is promoted for model building, as much as the quantitative interpretation of results, stimulating readers to think about data generating processes, as well as rational decision making. New Statistics for Design Researchers: A Bayesian Workflow in Tidy R targets scientists, industrial researchers and students in a range of disciplines, such as Human Factors, Applied Psychology, Communication Science, Industrial Design, Computer Science and Social Robotics. Statistical concepts are introduced in a problem-oriented way and with minimal formalism. Included primers on R and Bayesian statistics provide entry point for all backgrounds. A dedicated chapter on model criticism and comparison is a valuable addition for the seasoned scientist.\r\n\r\n"}

Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies.  Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum's Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher's striking advice for observational studies, \"make your theories elaborate.\"  The second edition of his book, Observational Studies, was published by Springer in 2002.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Solar cells have many applications including remote area power systems, earth-orbiting satellites, wristwatches, water pumping, photodetectors and remote radiotelephones. Solar cell technology is economically feasible for commercial-scale power generation. While commercial solar cells exhibit good performance and stability, still researchers are looking at many ways to improve the performance and cost of solar cells via modulating the fundamental properties of semiconductors. Solar cell technology is the key to a clean energy future. Solar cells directly harvest energy from the sun's light radiation into electricity are in an ever-growing demand for future global energy production. Solar cell-based energy harvesting has attracted worldwide attention for their notable features, such as cheap renewable technology, scalable, lightweight, flexibility, versatility, no greenhouse gas emission, environment, and economy friendly and operational costs are quite low compared to other forms of power generation. Thus, solar cell technology is at the forefront of renewable energy technologies which are used in telecommunications, power plants, small devices to satellites. Aiming at large-scale implementation can be manipulated by various types used in solar cell design and exploration of new materials towards improving performance and reducing cost. Therefore, in-depth knowledge about solar cell design is fundamental for those who wish to apply this knowledge and understanding in industries and academics. This book provides a comprehensive overview on solar cells and explores the history to evolution and present scenarios of solar cell design, classification, properties, various semiconductor materials, thin films, wafer-scale, transparent solar cells, and so on.

Around 70 % of freshwater consumption is converting into wastewater. Wastewater is contaminated by domestic, industrial, and commercial use that changes its parameters continuously such as COD, BOD, pH, harness, TSS, etc. Water scarcity is a big challenge to fulfill the per capita demand of the city. Hence there is an urgent need to treat the wastewater and utilize it effectively so that the demand for water can be full fill. It is observed that 99% of water is characterized by the rate of flow of its biological, chemical, and physical factors (BOD, COD, pH, TDS, TSS). Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a promising process combination of activated sludge treatment and membrane filtration for biomass reduction retention. MBR is the emerging treatment technology that was implemented to treat sewage wastewater and reuse the water for various purposes like gardening, toilet flushing, farming, etc. The design of the sewage treatment plant was carried out for Dr. Vithalrao Vikhe Patil College of Engineering Ahmednagar, (M.S), India.

The professional literature is mostly focused on conventional seagoing fleets, leaving a gap in the documentation of design practices for IW vessels. The principal attribute that differentiates river vessels from the seagoing ships is the low, or shallow, draught due to water depth restrictions.This book addresses key aspects for the design of contemporary, shallow draught IW vessels for the transport of dry cargo (containers and bulk cargo). Most of the logic that is presented is applicable to the design of river vessels for any river, but the material that is presented is focused on vessels for the River Danube and its tributaries. The term 'contemporary river vessel' assumes that the present-day technology and current Danube river infrastructure are taken into consideration in its design. It is believed that the technologies and concepts that are proposed here are applicable for all new vessel designs for the next 10 to 15 years. Other innovative technologies should be considered for designs beyond that horizon. Moreover, nowadays contemporary IW vessel must be in harmony with the Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) policies and hence special attention is paid to both ecology and efficiency. Note however that shipowners and ship operators usually tend to choose the conventional cost-effective transport technologies. Given that potential divergence of interests, the concepts and technologies treated here may be regarded as innovative. \r\n\r\n"}

Each of them strives to provide new answers to the question, \"What challenges await Data Design?\" To avoid falling into too narrow a mind-set, each works hard to elucidate the breadth of Data Design today and to demonstrate its widespread application across a variety of business sectors. With end users in mind, designer-contributors bring to light the myriad of purposes for which the field was originally intended, forging the bond even further between Data Design and the aims and intentions of those who contribute to it. The first seven parts of the book outline the scope of Data Design, and presents a line-up of \"viewpoints\" that highlight this discipline's main topics, and offers an in-depth look into practices boasting both foresight and imagination. The eighth and final part features a series of interviews with Data designers and artists whose methods embody originality and marked singularity. As a result, a number of enlightening concepts and bright ideas unfold within the confines of this book to help dispel the thick fog around this new and still relatively unknown discipline. A plethora of equally eye-opening and edifying new terms, words, and key expressions also unfurl. Informing, influencing, and inspiring are just a few of the buzz words belonging to an initiative that is, first and foremost, a creative one, not to mention the possibility to discern the ever-changing and naturally complex nature of today's datasphere. Providing an invaluable and cutting-edge resource for design researchers, this work is also intended for students, professionals and practitioners involved in Data Design, Interaction Design, Digital & Media Design, Data & Information Visualization, Computer Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n"}

Since older people make up a larger portion of the population than ever before, the resulting increase in the incidence of dementia presents a major challenge for society. Dementia is complex and multifaceted and impacts not only the person with the diagnosis but also those caring for them and society as a whole.  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design and development are pivotal in enabling people with dementia to live well and be supported in the communities around them. HCI is increasingly addressing the need for inclusivity and accessibility in the design and development of new technologies, interfaces, systems, services, and tools. Using interdisciplinary approaches HCI engages with the complexities and 'messiness' of real-world design spaces to provide novel perspectives and new ways of addressing the challenge of dementia and multi-stakeholder needs. HCI and Design in the Context of Dementia brings together the work of international experts, designers and researchers working across disciplines. It provides methodologies, methods and frameworks, approaches to participatory engagement and case studies showing how technology can impact the lives of people living with dementia and those around them. It includes examples of how to conduct dementia research and design in-context in the field of HCI, ethically and effectively and how these issues transcend the design space of dementia to inform HCI design and technology development more broadly. The book is valuable for and aimed at designers, researchers, scholars and caregivers that work with vulnerable groups like people with dementia, and those directly impacted.  \r\n\r\n"}

As a result, logic components in a System-On-Chip (SoC) have shown dramatic performance improvement. On the other hand, an on-chip interconnects which was considered only as a parasitic load before 1990s became the real performance bottleneck due to its extremely reduced cross section dimension. The ever decreasing interconnects cross section dimensions give rise to increase in resistance. Putting all these together, degradation of the RC time constant of on-chip metal wires becomes more serious. As a result, the continuous performance degradation of on-chip Cu\/low k interconnects is one of the greatest challenges to keep Moore's law alive while the scaling of transistors dimension has provided relentless delay improvement.\r\n                    \r\n"}

New amplitude distributions are designed and patterns are realized for discrete linear arrays. State of the art algorithms i.e. Nature Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms are used to obtain these distributions at the source locations. Arrays are further designed to obtain the source locations. The aim of the design is to produce desired radiation patterns using multi objective approach, i.e. to control beamwidth and sidelobe level simultaneously. Studies are also made to synthesize patterns from circular arrays to achieve minimum sidelobe level and high directivity with beamwidth constraint. The same methodology is extended to concentric circular arrays with dipoles as the radiating elements. In addition to the synthesis of desired pattern, by introducing the concept of thinning reduces the cost of the array design significantly. Overall conclusions are drawn and the future scope of the work is also presented at the end of the book.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This contest was organized and run by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) be- ginning in January 1997; Rijndael was announced as the winner in October 2000. It was the \"surprise winner\" because many observers (and even some participants) expressed scepticism that the D.S. government would adopt as an encryption standard any algorithm that was not designed by D.S. citizens. Yet NIST ran an open, international, selection process that should serve as model for other standards organizations. For example, NIST held their 1999 AES meeting in Rome, Italy. The five finalist algorithms were designed by teams from all over the world. In the end, the elegance, efficiency, security, and principled design of Rijndael won the day for its two Belgian designers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, over the competing finalist designs from RSA, IBM, Counterpane Systems, and an EnglishjIsraelijDanish team. This book is the story of the design of Rijndael, as told by the designers themselves. It outlines the foundations of Rijndael in relation to the previous ciphers the authors have designed. It explains the mathematics needed to and the operation of Rijndael, and it provides reference C code and underst test vectors for the cipher.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Addressing this gap, Handbook of Spatial Point-Pattern Analysis in Ecology shows how the techniques of point-pattern analysis are useful for tackling ecological problems. Within an ecological framework, the book guides readers through a variety of methods for different data types and aids in the interpretation of the results obtained by point-pattern analysis. Ideal for empirical ecologists who want to avoid advanced theoretical literature, the book covers statistical techniques for analyzing and interpreting the information contained in ecological patterns. It presents methods used to extract information hidden in spatial point-pattern data that may point to the underlying processes. The authors focus on point processes and null models that have proven their immediate utility for broad ecological applications, such as cluster processes.Along with the techniques, the handbook provides a comprehensive selection of real-world examples. Most of the examples are analyzed using Programita, a continuously updated software package based on the authors' many years of teaching and collaborative research in ecological point-pattern analysis. Programita is tailored to meet the needs of real-world applications in ecology. The software and a manual are available online.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) allows to leverage the best practices and principles, thus reduces a human effort for reinventing new design. Further, understanding a software design is not an easy task, it requires a lot of domain and a deep understanding of OOP principles. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify similar design structures in a group.Further, for large object-oriented systems, it is difficult to understand the functionalities because of their topological and behavioral complexity. It is even more difficult to extend or modify an existing design, which can be error-prone and can even lead to poor quality of software. Developers who work with software systems tend to break large and complex systems into smaller sub-components. Therefore, this research work proposes a partitioning based graph mining approach to discover frequent identical design patterns in an object-oriented design model.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Within information behavior research, there are often calls to bridge inclusiveness and for greater collaboration, with user-centered design approaches and, more specifically, participatory design practices. Collaboration and participation are essential in addressing contemporary societal challenges, designing creative information objects and processes, as well as developing spaces for learning, and information and research interventions. The intention is to improve access to information and the benefits to be gained from that. This also applies to bridging the digital divide and for embracing artificial intelligence. With regard to research and practices within information behavior, it is crucial to consider that all users should be involved. Many information activities (i.e., activities falling under the umbrella terms of information behavior and information practices) manifest through participation, and thus, methods such as participatory design may help unfold both information behavior and practices as well as the creation of information objects, new models, and theories. Information sharing is one of its core activities. For participatory design with its value set of democratic, inclusive, and open participation towards innovative practices in a diversity of contexts, it is essential to understand how information activities such as sharing manifest itself. For information behavior studies it is essential to deepen understanding of how information sharing manifests in order to improve access to information and the use of information. Third Space is a physical, virtual, cognitive, and conceptual space where participants may negotiate, reflect, and form new knowledge and worldviews working toward creative, practical and applicable solutions, finding innovative, appropriate research methods, interpreting findings, proposing new theories, recommending next steps, and even designing solutions such as new information objects or services. Information sharing in participatory design manifests in tandem with many other information interaction activities and especially information and cognitive processing. Although there are practices of individual information sharing and information encountering, information sharing mostly relates to collaborative information behavior practices, creativity, and collective decision-making. Our purpose with this book is to enable students, researchers, and practitioners within a multi-disciplinary research field, including information studies and Human-Computer Interaction approaches, to gain a deeper understanding of how the core activity of information sharing in participatory design, in which Third Space may be a platform for information interaction, is taking place when using methods utilized in participatory design to address contemporary societal challenges. This could also apply for information behavior studies using participatory design as methodology. We elaborate interpretations of core concepts such as participatory design, Third Space, information sharing, and collaborative information behavior, before discussing participatory design methods and processes in more depth. We also touch on information behavior, information practice, and other important concepts. Third Space, information sharing, and information interaction are discussed in some detail. A framework, with Third Space as a core intersecting zone, platform, and adaptive and creative space to study information sharing and other information behavior and interactions are suggested. As a tool to envision information behavior and suggest future practices, participatory design serves as a set of methods and tools in which new interpretations of the design of information behavior studies and eventually new information objects are being initiated involving multiple stakeholders in future information landscapes.

Within information behavior research, there are often calls to bridge inclusiveness and for greater collaboration, with user-centered design approaches and, more specifically, participatory design practices. Collaboration and participation are essential in addressing contemporary societal challenges, designing creative information objects and processes, as well as developing spaces for learning, and information and research interventions. The intention is to improve access to information and the benefits to be gained from that. This also applies to bridging the digital divide and for embracing artificial intelligence. With regard to research and practices within information behavior, it is crucial to consider that all users should be involved. Many information activities (i.e., activities falling under the umbrella terms of information behavior and information practices) manifest through participation, and thus, methods such as participatory design may help unfold both information behavior and practices as well as the creation of information objects, new models, and theories. Information sharing is one of its core activities. For participatory design with its value set of democratic, inclusive, and open participation towards innovative practices in a diversity of contexts, it is essential to understand how information activities such as sharing manifest itself. For information behavior studies it is essential to deepen understanding of how information sharing manifests in order to improve access to information and the use of information. Third Space is a physical, virtual, cognitive, and conceptual space where participants may negotiate, reflect, and form new knowledge and worldviews working toward creative, practical and applicable solutions, finding innovative, appropriate research methods, interpreting findings, proposing new theories, recommending next steps, and even designing solutions such as new information objects or services. Information sharing in participatory design manifests in tandem with many other information interaction activities and especially information and cognitive processing. Although there are practices of individual information sharing and information encountering, information sharing mostly relates to collaborative information behavior practices, creativity, and collective decision-making. Our purpose with this book is to enable students, researchers, and practitioners within a multi-disciplinary research field, including information studies and Human-Computer Interaction approaches, to gain a deeper understanding of how the core activity of information sharing in participatory design, in which Third Space may be a platform for information interaction, is taking place when using methods utilized in participatory design to address contemporary societal challenges. This could also apply for information behavior studies using participatory design as methodology. We elaborate interpretations of core concepts such as participatory design, Third Space, information sharing, and collaborative information behavior, before discussing participatory design methods and processes in more depth. We also touch on information behavior, information practice, and other important concepts. Third Space, information sharing, and information interaction are discussed in some detail. A framework, with Third Space as a core intersecting zone, platform, and adaptive and creative space to study information sharing and other information behavior and interactions are suggested. As a tool to envision information behavior and suggest future practices, participatory design serves as a set of methods and tools in which new interpretations of the design of information behavior studies and eventually new information objects are being initiated involving multiple stakeholders in future information landscapes. For this purpose\r\n                    \r\n"}

Firstly, the self-similarity property was studied. The cavity model is used to analyze an equilateral triangular patch on a grounded dielectric substrate. A Matlab program was built to calculate the resonant frequencies, the input impedance, the reflection coefficient, etc. Then this triangular patch was used as the initiator of the Sierpinski Gasket fractal antenna with probe feeding. The first three iterations of this antenna were studied. These novel shapes include an air gap between the substrate and the ground plane, inverting the patch to reduce the dielectric loss and consequently increase the antenna efficiency and adding a shorting pin to improve the matching conditions as well as reducing the antenna size. Secondly, the space-filling property was studied and the rectangular microstrip patch was used as an initiator to all iterations. The first three iterations of a single pulse microstrip patch antenna were investigated. The second step was to study other shapes like the two pulses, NRZ (Non Return to Zero), Koch at angles 30o, 60o, 80o and 90o, Pulse 2.45 and Pulse 2.45 + Koch 90o microstrip antennas.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Consequently, the fatigue effects on bridges need to be considered and more accurately reflected within the proper bridge design specifications. This thesis describes the calibration process used to select the load and resistance factors for the fatigue limit states of steel bridge members within the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The process presented within this thesis builds upon work completed as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program No. 2 including the determination of the fatigue load model. The resistance model was developed using available fatigue test data and statistically analyzed using specially developed techniques. Load and resistance factors were finally chosen for both Fatigue I and Fatigue II service limit states. We expect the new load and resistance factors for the fatigue service limit states to more accurately capture the fatigue effects of steel bridges and thus increase their service life.\r\n                    \r\n"}

India is at 2nd position in world in onion production. The commonly used manual harvesting of onion is time consuming, less efficient and full of drudgery so the mechanization of harvesting is essentially needed. One of the main reasons of low productivity is insufficient man power availability on the farm and low level of farm mechanization. This is especially true for India. This prototype will be small and less costly compared to other harvesting machinery and provides efficient and effective method for harvesting to reduce human effort which is useful for small scale farmers. When the engine is started, the shaft starts to rotate along with the digger. The digger digs into the ground due to the rotation of the shaft. The assembled setup of digger carries the onion and throws it on to the conveyor. The conveyor is equipped with strips to hold the onion. The onion is carried by the conveyor and is deposited in the container. Due to motion of the machine the vibration is generated which in turn separates the soil from the onion.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Especially, robots are supposed to be able to learn manipulation skills from humans. To this end, a number of learning algorithms and techniques have been developed and successfully implemented for various robotic tasks. Among these methods, learning from demonstrations (LfD) enables robots to effectively and efficiently acquire skills by learning from human demonstrators, such that a robot can be quickly programmed to perform a new task.This book introduces recent results on the development of advanced LfD-based learning and control approaches to improve the robot dexterous manipulation. First, there's an introduction to the simulation tools and robot platforms used in the authors' research. In order to enable a robot learning of human-like adaptive skills, the book explains how to transfer a human user's arm variable stiffness to the robot, based on the online estimation from the muscle electromyography (EMG). Next, the motion and impedance profiles can be both modelled by dynamical movement primitives such that both of them can be planned and generalized for new tasks. Furthermore, the book introduces how to learn the correlation between signals collected from demonstration, i.e., motion trajectory, stiffness profile estimated from EMG and interaction force, using statistical models such as hidden semi-Markov model and Gaussian Mixture Regression. Several widely used human-robot interaction interfaces (such as motion capture-based teleoperation) are presented, which allow a human user to interact with a robot and transfer movements to it in both simulation and real-word environments. Finally, improved performance of robot manipulation resulted from neural network enhanced control strategies is presented. A large number of examples of simulation and experiments of daily life tasks are included in this book to facilitate better understanding of the readers.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Conservation and development of new energy sources or the expansions of existing sources were two major phases of energy programs. Energy conservation was of critical importance to the world; yet despite predictions of severe shortages, conservation attempts had not been entirely successful and great amounts of energy were still wasted. Greater energy efficiency was needed in cars and in electrical and gas equipment. Better insulated home and a general reduction in energy usage was essential. The world had to become less dependent on gas and oil as sources of energy.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It is generally used to control the rate of flow, velocity, and pressure. The shape of the nozzle also plays a vital role in the process. Simply a nozzle is a tool that extracts the entering fluid which may be a gas or a liquid and rises its velocity. A nozzle can be a channel or canal or tube or pipe that helps in modifying the speed of the stream of fluid. We have convergent and divergent or both convergent-divergent types of nozzles. Ans also the varying cross-sections of the area of the nozzles affect the speed of the fluid. That means when the area of the nozzle is reduced the rate of nozzle fluid raises and in the same way as the area of the nozzle is raised or increased then the rate of nozzle fluid is reduced. The paper concentrate on the study of flow in nozzles. And the application of the nozzles for different shapes of pintle to increase the performance of propulsion.\r\n                    \r\n"}

There is a dire need of electric power generation plants to fulfill the growing demand for electricity. Pakistan has plenty of potential from water, wind and solar, but the latter two are expensive and difficult to be included in national grid. However, the hydro potential can effectively be utilized either through building dams or run-of-river plants for electrical generation. Studies have shown that most of the villages in district Peshawar of KPK Province have canals with very small head, ranging from 1 to 10 meters. Effective utilization of low head to produce electrical power efficiently is a challenge. The purpose of this study is to implement a mini hydro power plant for remote areas of Pakistan.\r\n                    \r\n"}

During my research, I was able to feel that enough work has already been done on the fabrication and characterization of thin films, but lesser research has been reported on improving the quality of thin films and the parameters necessary to isolate good quality thin films. So, we designed an automated jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis (JNSP) system and isolated certain parameters that are responsible for the better quality of thin films, and standardize the process for thin film deposition using automation. Zinc (Zn) doped copper oxide (CuO) thin films were deposited by manual and automated JNSP system and their characterization was compared for p-n junction diode application. To the best of our knowledge, the fabrication of p-Zn: CuO\/n-Si diode using an automated JNSP system has been not much studied in the available literature except for a few. To a large extent, we are successful in this research which is presented in this book.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It covers the most common aspects of experimental design such as handling multiple treatment factors and improving precision. In addition, it addresses experiments with large numbers of treatment factors and response surface methods for optimizing experimental conditions or biotechnological yields.The book emphasizes the estimation of effect sizes and the principled use of statistical arguments in the broader scientific context. It gradually transitions from classical analysis of variance to modern linear mixed models, and provides detailed information on power analysis and sample size determination, including 'portable power' formulas for making quick approximate calculations. In turn, detailed discussions of several real-life examples illustrate the complexities and aberrations that can arise in practice.Chiefly intended for students, teachers and researchers in the fields of experimental biology and biomedicine, the book is largely self-contained and starts with the necessary background on basic statistical concepts. The underlying ideas and necessary mathematics are gradually introduced in increasingly complex variants of a single example. Hasse diagrams serve as a powerful method for visualizing and comparing experimental designs and deriving appropriate models for their analysis. Manual calculations are provided for early examples, allowing the reader to follow the analyses in detail. More complex calculations rely on the statistical software R, but are easily transferable to other software.  Though there are few prerequisites for effectively using the book, previous exposure to basic statistical ideas and the software R would be advisable.\r\n\r\n"}

Sequential behavior seems to be involved in the processes of sequential learning, decision-making processes, and exploratory behavior. There are, however, competing hypotheses regarding the mechanisms involved in the complexity of the behavioral responses of organisms when exposed to changing environments. The behavioral response to different environmental conditions is often utilized in behavioral ecology studies, where the changes in behavior are quantified in terms of probability of dispersal, distance, and speed of movements or time budget, where the time spent on different activities (foraging, resting, explore, etc.) is registered and analyzed in terms of cost-benefit. This book represents a series of articles covering a broad spectrum of organisms and proposes the analysis of sequential behavior utilizing indices commonly applied in the estimation of developmental instability (fluctuating asymmetry, directional asymmetry, and antisymmetry) toward estimating the degree of \"Behavioral Instability\". Deviations from symmetry will be interpreted in ecological and evolutionary terms, where the cost and benefits of changes of the degree of behavioral instability will be analyzed in terms of overall costs and benefits and its evolutionary significance. Presented in this collection are multidisciplinary studies (theoretical and computational as well as experimental and empirical approaches) that validate the proposed approach and pave the way for future investigation in the novel field of what is best described as behavioral instability.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The act of walking is hence intended as a process of (re-)discovering, reflecting and learning through an embodied experience. Specific attention is devoted to the investigation of the ambiance of places and its dynamic atmospheric perception that contribute to generating the social experience. This topic is gaining increasing attention and has been studied in several forms in different disciplines to investigate the particular spatial, social, sensory and atmospheric character of places. The book contains chapters by experts in the field and covers both the theory and the practice of innovative methods, techniques, and technologies. It examines experiential walks in the perspective of an interdisciplinary approach to environmental and sensory urban design by organising the contributions according to three specific interrelated focuses, namely the exploration and investigation of the multisensory dimension of public spaces, the different ways to grasp and communicate the in-motion experience through traditional and novel forms of representation, and the application of the approach to urban participatory planning and higher education. Shedding new light on the topic, the book offers both a reference guide for those engaged in applied research, and a toolkit for professionals and students.\r\n\r\n"}

The presence of vast performance data for larger propellers cannot be applied to these small-diameter propellers that operate at low Reynolds numbers, and the aerodynamic performance data at these low Reynolds numbers seldom exists. Analytical method such as momentum-blade element theory together with computational methods such as CFD can be relied upon to design and optimise the performance of propellers of any class. In the current work, the design and performance evaluation of a propeller applicable to a MAV is carried out for a given thrust of 1 N, diameter of 120 mm and speed of 10,000 rpm. The design was based on one-dimensional momentum theory. Design modifications were done by varying the blade setting angle at 75% radius to enhance the performance of the propeller.

However, the greater circuit density of VLSI circuits and systems has made testing more difficult and costly. This book notes that one solution is to develop faster and more efficient algorithms to generate test patterns or use design techniques to enhance testability - that is, design for testability. Design for testability techniques offer one approach toward alleviating this situation by adding enough extra circuitry to a circuit or chip to reduce the complexity of testing. Because the cost of hardware is decreasing as the cost of testing rises, there is now a growing interest in these techniques for VLSI circuits.The first half of the book focuses on the problem of testing: test generation, fault simulation, and complexity of testing. The second half takes up the problem of design for testability: design techniques to minimize test application and\/or test generation cost, scan design for sequential logic circuits, compact testing, built-in testing, and various design techniques for testable systems.Logic Testing and Design for Testability is included in the Computer Systems Series, edited by Herb Schwetman.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It implements the algorithms in Perl and R, two widely used scripting languages in computational biology. The book provides a well-rounded explanation of traditional issues as well as an up-to-date account of more recent developments, such as graph similarity and search. It is organized around the specific algorithmic problems that arise when dealing with structures that are commonly found in computational biology, including biological sequences, trees, and graphs. For each of these structures, the author makes a clear distinction between problems that arise in the analysis of one structure and in the comparative analysis of two or more structures. He also presents phylogenetic trees and networks as examples of trees and graphs in computational biology.This book supplies a comprehensive view of the whole field of combinatorial pattern matching from a computational biology perspective. Along with thorough discussions of each biological problem, it includes detailed algorithmic solutions in pseudo-code, full Perl and R implementation, and pointers to other software, such as those on CPAN and CRAN.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Rocket Science to students who are fresh out of high school. Assume no background in Calculus, Graphics, Computing, or College Physics or Chemistry. Well, the Wright Brothers did not have A.E. degrees either, and they flew just fine, in a craft that still amazes designers. Several senior students taking Aircraft Design helped me with the standards that had to be met; a book received as birthday present told me the specifications of a new airliner. Advice at a party on Why First-Year Students Are Different, came in very handy indeed. On the first day, several senior colleagues populated the back row of the auditorium, purportedly to learn but possibly in anticipation of seeing me falling on my face. The students were told that they would be \"flying\" their own airliner designs inside 6 weeks. Whatever they thought of that, they just smiled. And did it. So can you. Hundreds of aerospace engineers have gone through the decades of course experience that now provide the backdrop of this book. The key is for the learner to have a certain amount of faith that there is a method to what looks like madness. It is undeniable that many students who come through the Introduction course, then and now, do better designs, and demonstrate more comfort in the basic disciplines, than what the Seniors could do in a prior era. Somewhere along the way students got tired of designing transonic airliners, and wanted to go straight into their own supersonic planes and spacecraft - and so they did. There is no magic here: just a simplified explanation of how requirements are laid out, a first \"guess\" is made, and how that that is used to successively reduce uncertainty about every part of the vehicle and its life-cycle. The rigorous analysis that comes in the various disciplines of aerospace engineering, is glimpsed but not allowed to drown the learner at this stage. If the book succeeds, perhaps it may inspire a designer who will make the next generation of supersonic airliners happen. Among many other dreams that await determined effort to realize them.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Maybe, but coding is not design. Large-scale or expensive apps clearly require evaluation of design choices. Still, software design directly impacts code reuse and longevity even for small-scale apps with limited overhead. This text evaluates and contrasts common object-oriented designs. A given problem may have many solutions. A developer may employ different design techniques - composition, inheritance, dependency injection, delegation, etc. - to solve a particular problem. A skilled developer can determine the costs and benefits of different design responses, even amid competing concerns. A responsible developer documents design choices as a contract with the client, delineating external and internal responsibilities. To promote effective software design, this book examines contractual, object-oriented designs for immediate and sustained use as well as code reuse. The intent of identifying design variants is to recognize and manage conflicting goals such as short versus long-term utility, stability versus flexibility, and storage versus computation.

It devotes three chapters to review the background and basic knowledge, four chapters to discuss specific types of cryptographic primitive design for blockchain, one chapter to discuss optimization tools and another chapter for blockchain regulation and economies. This book covers the systematic survey of research objects, as well as detailed reviews of cryptographic schemes, lectures and methodologies to practice cryptography.The main findings of this book are summarized as following, first, the practical design and analysis of cryptographic schemes for blockchain can address major problems in blockchain at algorithmic level. Then, some intrinsic deficiencies in some traditional cryptographic primitives, like centralized setup, impractical design, etc, prevent the successful application of these primitives in blockchain. However, huge efforts are being made to make these primitives practical and applicable for researchers. Finally, the formal and rigorous design and analysis of public key cryptographic algorithms is vital to blockchain. Design and Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms in Blockchain is a useful textbook for graduate students and PhD students, or researches who wish to connect cryptography with blockchain for research and developing projects.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In these cases, the mechanics of materials have been pushed to the extreme edges of human knowledge to enable cutting-edge, unprecedented functionalities and technological innovations. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction, in situ small-scale mechanical testing combined with physics-based computational modeling\/simulation, has been widely used approaches to probe these mechanics of the materials at their extreme limits due to their recently discovered distinct advantages. The techniques discussed in this manuscript are highlights specially curated from the broad body of work recently reported in the literature, especially ones that the author had led the pursuits at the frontier himself. Extreme stress generation in these advanced material leads to often new failure modes, and hence, the reliability of the final product is directly affected. From the recent topics and various advanced case studies covered in this book, the reader gets an updated knowledge of how new mechanics can and has been applied in Design-for-Reliability (DfR) for some of the latest technological innovations known in our modern world. Further, this also helps in building better designs, which may avoid the pitfalls of the current practiced trends.\r\n\r\n"}

Written by leading experts, it presents an in-depth analysis of the current issues and challenges in the field, including recent advances in the generation and characterization of reduced-genome strains generated from model organisms with relevance in biotechnology, and basic research such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and yeast. It also discusses methodologies, such as bottom-up and top-down genome minimization strategies, as well as novel analytical and experimental approaches to characterize and generate minimal cells. Lastly, it presents the latest research related to minimal cells of serveral microorganisms, e.g. Bacillus subtilis.The design of biological systems for biotechnological purposes employs strategies aimed at optimizing specific tasks. This approach is based on enhancing certain biological functions while reducing other capacities that are not required or that could be detrimental to the desired objective. A highly optimized cell factory would be expected to have only the capacity for reproduction and for performing the expected task. Such a hypothetical organism would be considered a minimal cell. At present, numerous research groups in academia and industry are exploring the theoretical and practical implications of constructing and using minimal cells and are providing valuable fundamental insights into the characteristics of minimal genomes, leading to an understanding of the essential gene set. In addition, research in this field is providing valuable information on the physiology of minimal cells and their utilization as a biological chassis to which useful biotechnological functions can be added.\r\n                    \r\n"}

People vary in how likely they are to respond and in how they respond. This variation leads to opportunities to selectively deploy design features in order to control both nonresponse and measurement errors. ASD aims at the optimal matching of design features and the characteristics of respondents given the survey budget. Such a goal is sensible, but ASD requires investment in more advanced technical systems and management infrastructure and asks for the collection of relevant auxiliary data. So what are current best practices in ASD? And is ASD worthwhile when the same auxiliary data are employed in the estimation afterwards?

As computing networks come into being, one of the latest dreams is now possible - distributed computing. Distributed computing brings transparent access to as much computer power and data as the user needs for accomplishing any given task - simultaneously achieving high performance and reliability.The subject of distributed computing is diverse, and many researchers are investigating various issues concerning the structure of hardware and the design of distributed software. Distributed System Design defines a distributed system as one that looks to its users like an ordinary system, but runs on a set of autonomous processing elements (PEs) where each PE has a separate physical memory space and the message transmission delay is not negligible. With close cooperation among these PEs, the system supports an arbitrary number of processes and dynamic extensions.Distributed System Design outlines the main motivations for building a distributed system, including: inherently distributed applications performance\/cost resource sharing flexibility and extendibility availability and fault tolerance scalabilityPresenting basic concepts, problems, and possible solutions, this reference serves graduate students in distributed system design as well as computer professionals analyzing and designing distributed\/open\/parallel systems.Chapters discuss:  the scope of distributed computing systems general distributed programming languages and a CSP-like distributed control description language (DCDL) expressing parallelism, interprocess communication and synchronization, and fault-tolerant design two approaches describing a distributed system: the time-space view and the interleaving view mutual exclusion and related issues, including election, bidding, and self-stabilization prevention and detection of deadlock reliability, safety, and security as well as various methods of handling node, communication, Byzantine, and software faults efficient interprocessor communication mechanisms as well as these mechanisms without specific constraints, such as adaptiveness, deadlock-freedom, and fault-tolerance virtual channels and virtual networks load distribution problems synchronization of access to shared data while supporting a high degree of concurrency\r\n                    \r\n"}

In this book, foundations of a systematic model-based strategy for simultaneous process design, scheduling, and control optimization is detailed to achieve reduced cost and improved energy consumption in process systems. The material covered in this book is well suited for the use of industrial practitioners, academics, and researchers. In Chapter 1, a historical perspective on the milestones in model-based design optimization techniques is presented along with an overview of the state-of-the-art mathematical tools to solve the resulting complex problems.

Step-by-step examples take readers through methods for tracing the evolution of road networks, and their impacts on contemporary community spaces. Easy-to-follow guides to programming show how to process and plot community data sets as network graphs. They reveal how these can help to observe and represent the different ways in which community spaces are inter-connected. This book places these technological methods in the context of current theories of community formations. It considers how these cutting-edge tools for thinking in urban design research - comprising both theories and methods - could transform our understanding of community spaces as being complex, inter-dependent and socially meaningful assets.This book is pioneering in its analysis of the urban contexts to community formations, and in its argument for professional integration between urban and knowledge practitioners.

The material presented is a compilation of the practical approaches used over the author's 37-year career at Eaton Research Labs and is intended to help the reader gain a feel for locations and strengths of magnetic fields and an intuitive insight into what magnetic fields do and how to use them. This book makes magnetics easy to understand and practical to apply in magnetic research, experimentation, and analysis of magnetic fields encountered in engineering challenges. Accurate and reliable methods are presented for the design of magnetic sensors, actuators, controls, and other electromechanical devices with the notable exclusion of rotating machines that are well covered by various authors and courses in university Electrical Engineering departments. Actuators, solenoids, and magnetic sensors have been around in various forms for over a century, and they are critical components of control and protection systems including relays and circuit breakers. This book has a strong foundation in the methods developed by H. C. Roters with additional topics in the areas of permanent magnet materials and permanent magnet performance in particular. The methodologies also take full advantage of complex spreadsheet capabilities, as well as finite element analysis as a counterpart to the calculations. Design examples include calculations for losses and temperature rise, which are critical for all electromagnetic systems. The smallest design usually has the highest temperature rise. The best design usually considers the trade-off between size and temperature rise. The design calculations presented are practical in the sense that they can be quickly and accurately applied in a spreadsheet model using the permeance method (also known as reluctance method or magnetic circuit method). The permeance method evaluates the magnetic field from the perspective of a magnetic circuit, analogous to an electric circuit. Chapter 1 describes this in detail and aims to provide an understanding of magnetic flux paths based on the simple question, If I were a magnetic flux line, where would I go? The accuracy of the permeance method is demonstrated with comparisons to measurements and finite element simulations. Practical methods also address the issues of time and effort. Some ideas need only feasibility level accuracy, while other design-specific challenges require high-level accuracy. This relates directly to budget and schedule issues on engineering projects. Increased effort (model detail, complexity, size, time) is needed to achieve increased accuracy. The best strategic approach is to use a method that is quick and provides enough accuracy to make a valid design decision. A spectrum of calculation methods can be considered 1) a hand calculation, 2) a simple spreadsheet model, 3) a complex spreadsheet model, 4) a 2D or axisymmetric finite element model, 5) a 3D finite element model. A spreadsheet model can also be used to quickly determine the starting size for a finite element model. A critical step for gaining confidence in the validity of any analysis is to check the results against those of a simple calculation. In general, when doing a complex analysis (such as a finite element simulation), the first step should be a simple calculation (such as a spreadsheet calculation) and a visualization of the magnetic field. The finite element simulation results can then be quickly reviewed for the shape of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the flux density, current and force, to judge if the results are reasonable. Finite element models have many input values and boundary conditions that are prone to typographical errors (such as a decimal point error, or a dimensional units error). Errors can be quickly detected when compared to a simple calculation and magnetic field visualization.\r\n                    \r\n"}

As 5G wireless increasingly establishes itself over the next few years, moving legacy applications into these new architectures will be critical for companies to compete in a consumer-driven and social media-based economy. Few organizations, however, understand the challenges and complexities of moving from a central database legacy architecture to a ledger and networked environment.The challenge is not limited to just designing new software applications. Indeed, the next generation needs to function more independently on various devices, and on more diverse and wireless-centric networks. Furthermore, databases must be broken down into linked list-based blockchain architectures, which will involve analytic decisions regarding which portions of data and metadata will be processed within the chain, and which ones will be dependent on cloud systems. Finally, the collection of all data throughout these vast networks will need to be aggregated and used for predictive analysis across a variety of competitive business applications in a secured environment.

The updating process is usually achieved using a standardized approach consisting of collecting and processing information through acoustic models to produce the updated noise maps. This procedure is time consuming and costly, and has a significant impact on the financial statement of the authorities responsible for providing the maps. Furthermore, the END requires that easy-to-read noise maps are made available to the public to provide information on noise levels and the subsequent actions to be undertaken by local and central authorities to reduce noise impacts. In order to update the noise maps more easily and in a more effective way, it is convenient to design an integrated system incorporating real-time noise measurement and signal processing to identify and analyze the noise sources present in the mapping area (e.g., road traffic noise, leisure noise, etc.) as well as to automatically generate and present the corresponding noise maps.

This book presents the principles of earthquake-resistant structural engineering, and uses the latest tools and techniques to give practical design guidance to address single or multiple seismic performance levels. It presents an elegant, simple and theoretically coherent design framework. Required strength is determined on the basis of an estimated yield displacement and desired limits of system ductility and drift demands. A simple deterministic approach is presented along with its elaboration into a probabilistic treatment that allows for design to limit annual probabilities of failure. The design method allows the seismic force resisting system to be designed on the basis of elastic analysis results, while nonlinear analysis is used for performance verification. Detailing requirements of ACI 318 and Eurocode 8 are presented. Students will benefit from the coverage of seismology, structural dynamics, reinforced concrete, and capacity design approaches, which allows the book to be used as a foundation text in earthquake engineering.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This is framed by an examination of the social projects, spaces, and realities that have shaped three contexts critical to the understanding of urban design problems in China: the histories of \"collective forms\" and \"collective spaces\", such as that of the urban danwei (work-unit), which inform current community building and planning; socio-spatial changes in urban and rural development; and disparate practices of \"spatialised governmentality\". These contexts and an attendant transformation from planning to design and from government to governance, define the current urban design challenges found in the dominant urban xiaoqu (small district) and shequ (community) development model. Examining the histories, transformations, and practices that have shaped socio-spatial epistemologies and experiences in China - including a specific sense of community and place that is rather based on a concrete \"collective\" than abstract \"public\" space and underpinned by socialised governance - this book brings together a diverse range of observations, thoughts, analyses, and projects by urban researchers and practitioners. Thereby discussing emerging interdisciplinary urban design practices in China, this book offers a valuable resource for all academics, practitioners, and stakeholders with an interest in socio-spatial design and development.\r\n\r\n"}

The book examines an integral approach to contemporary theories of planning and design that explores the human-nature relationship patterns in social and spatial interconnections, between people and their natural environments. The interconnectedness of human and natural systems is used to scaffold possible solutions to address key environmental and sustainability issues that specifically address the need for patterns of behaviour that acknowledge the duality of 'man and nature'.  In 12 chapters, the book presents a holistic, regenerative-adaptive pattern language that encapsulates how communities can better appreciate landscape change under future climate effects, and acknowledges the importance to adapt to patterns of change of place and the environment and therefore inform the communities' responses for sustainable development. The application of the regenerative-adaptive pattern language was tested along the Great Ocean Road region of the Victorian coast in Australia. The concluding chapters argues that for human settlements and cities to be resilient and sustainable, we must understand the interconnected patterns of human-built environments and natural systems, and how we function in a social-spatial dimension with these. The book is intended for practitioners and academic scholars with interest in sustainable development, regenerative design, pattern languages, biophilia, settlement planning, and climate change adaptation.\r\n\r\n"}

Engineers always strive to design efficient structural systems which must be as economical as possible yet strong enough to withstand the most demanding functional requirements arising during their service life. The traditional trial and error structural approach is very often not sufficient to achieve designs satisfying economical and safety criteria simultaneously.  This book presents efficient metaheuristic algorithms for optimal design of structures, many of which have been developed by the author and his students. They are augmented by further metaheuristics developed by other authors and have been successfully applied to various optimization problems in the field. The concepts and algorithms presented in this book are not only applicable to the optimization of skeletal structures and finite element models, but equally can be utilized for optimal design of other systems in hydraulic engineering, transportation, mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering and electrical engineering. In this present updated third edition, five new chapters have been added covering new developments in the field of optimization.\r\n\r\n"}

While a single fiber strand in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) has over a terabit-per-second bandwidth and a wavelength channel has over a gigabit-per-second transmission speed, the network may still be required to support traffic requests at rates that are lower than the full wavelength capacity. To avoid assigning an entire lightpath to a small request, many researchers have looked at adding traffic grooming to the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. In this work, we consider the RWA problem with traffic grooming (GRWA) for mesh networks under static and dynamic lightpath connection requests. The GRWA problem is NP-Complete since it is a generalization of the RWA problem which is known to be NP-Complete. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model that accurately depicts the GRWA problem. Because it is very hard to find a solution for large networks using ILP, we solve the GRWA problem by proposing two novel heuristics. The strength of the proposed heuristics stems from their simplicity, efficiency and applicability to large-scale networks. The book is addressed to professionals in optical communcation networks like professors, students and engineers.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Approaches to conceptualising emotions in technology design, how emotions can be operationalised and how they can be measured are paramount to ascertaining the core principles of design.  Emotions in Technology Design: From Experience to Ethics provides a multi-dimensional approach to studying, designing and comprehending emotions in design. It presents emotions as understood through basic human-technology research, applied design practice, culture and aesthetics, ethical approaches to emotional design, and ethics as a cultural framework for emotions in design experience. Core elements running through the book are: cognitive science - cognitive-affective theories of emotions (i.e., Appraisal); culture - the ways in which our minds are trained to recognise, respond to and influence design; and ethics - a deep cultural framework of interpretations of good versus evil. This ethical understanding brings culture and cognition together to form genuine emotional experience.  This book is essential reading for designers, technology developers, HCI and cognitive science scholars, educators and students (at both undergraduate and graduate levels) in terms of emotional design methods and tools, systematic measurement of emotion in design experience, cultural theory underpinning how emotions operate in the production and interaction of design, and how ethics influence basic (primal) and higher level emotional reactions. The broader scope equips design practitioners, developers and scholars with that 'something more' in terms of understanding how emotional experience of technology can be positioned in relation to cultural discourse and ethics.\r\n\r\n"}

The physical form of cities is structured in different elements of urban form. Each of these elements, and the way they are combined into distinct patterns, is shaped by various agents and processes of change. Planning, urban design and architecture are practice-oriented activities that have a significant impact on these elements. Yet, this 'action' on the physical form if cities tends to be separated from scientific 'knowledge' on this complex object. In fact, none of these activities is strongly related to urban morphology, the science of urban form. There are many reasons for this gap. One of the reasons is the lack of significant examples of how the bridging process can happen. The book addresses this specific issue. It gathers a number of cases, developed in the last years in different geographical contexts - from Latin America to Eastern Asia - that exemplify how to move from scientific research to professional practice. Each case, or set of cases, is presented in one chapter. The first part of each chapter presents the morphological view of his\/her author(s) on the process of city building; the second part exemplifies how this author moves from reading to design.\r\n\r\n"}

The only prerequisites for this book are familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures (lists, maps, recursion, etc.), a rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture and assembly language, and some experience with the Java programming language.A complete study of compilers could easily fill several graduate-level courses, and therefore some simplifications and compromises are necessary for a one-semester course that is accessible to undergraduate students. Following are some of the decisions made in order to accommodate the goals of this book.The book has a narrow focus as a project-oriented course on compilers. Compiler theory is kept to a minimum, but the project orientation retains the \"fun\" part of studying compilers.The source language being compiled is relatively simple, but it is powerful enough to be interesting and challenging. It has basic data types, arrays, procedures, functions, and parameters, but it relegates many other interesting language features to the project exercises.The target language is assembly language for a virtual machine with a stack-based architecture, similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

The only prerequisites for this book are familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures (lists, maps, recursion, etc.), a rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture and assembly language, and some experience with the Kotlin programming language or a closely related language such as Java.A complete study of compilers could easily fill several graduate-level courses, and therefore some simplifications and compromises are necessary for a one-semester course that is accessible to undergraduate students. Following are some of the decisions made in order to accommodate the goals of this book.1. The book has a narrow focus as a project-oriented course on compilers. Compiler theory is kept to a minimum, but the project orientation retains the \"fun\" part of studying compilers. 2. The source language being compiled is relatively simple, but it is powerful enough to be interesting and challenging. It has basic data types, arrays, procedures, functions, and parameters, but it relegates many other interesting language features to the project exercises.3. The target language is assembly language for a virtual machine with a stack-based architecture, similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This approach greatly simplifies code generation. Both an assembler and an emulator for the virtual machine are provided on the course web site.4. No special compiler-related tools are required or used within the book. Students require access only to a Kotlin compiler and a text editor, but most students will want to use Kotlin with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).5.

Technology has pervaded all spheres of human activities, including library services. An organised library is a must in institutions of learning at all levels. Thus, in this age of technology, automating library services becomes the way to go. So, using Office Technology and Management Department as case study, this work developed a computer-based one-stop-shop, library information system that is user-friendly for proper inventory of library resources. Following observations, interviews and review of existing documentation, the Structured System Analysis Design (SSADM) and Knowledge Engineering Methodologies were used for problem analysis and design. Unified Modeling Language was used for the design, with underlying database interface using CSS and HTML and a back-end PHP framework. This system would ensure improved services for libraries due to better storage and retrieval. This work should especially pique the interest of institutions of learning, software programmers, library managers, information technologists and indeed all individual book lovers who own or intend to own private libraries.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Over the course of my career, I have worked across these various areas within design utilizing design thinking, processes and execution of work in collaboration with many others in the corporate global space, startups, small businesses and non-profits. This writing serves as an exercise in thinking about design, the current landscape of design, and what might the future designer need to encompass for design to evolve and succeed amidst the changing global cultural landscape. The idea of the term \"metamodernism\" serves as a framework to observe and describe a sensibility happening within culture. The first half of this book discusses views on design and culture and the last half explores how the designer might approach the future of design related to these observations. Within these two sections, I try to describe and articulate the ideas around \"metamodernism\" and how we came to be within that movement today. It's been a long journey of success and failure within the work of design. This book is a collection of thoughts and observations collected over time through working on large and small design projects, leading teams, failing in startups, writing code, building apps, creating album art, designing brands and building platforms and campaigns for some of the biggest companies in the world. This book doesn't provide specific answers to become a great designer through practice and technique, but provokes you to think about the observations laid out to create a new place to observe, think and find new ways to apply design for the future.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This theses addresses the various tradeoffs involved when designing SRAM's. Each component of the SRAM is looked at in detail and various tradeoffs explored. The key to low power operation in the SRAM data path is to reduce the signal swing on the high capacitance nodes like the bitlines and the data lines. A unique resetting scheme for the row decoders has been proposed. Using this technique the word line pulse width can be minimized and the signal swings on the bitlines reduced. Finally a 4Kb prototype SRAM has been designed and verified. This design incorporates some of the circuit techniques used to reduce power dissipation and delay. Experimental data has been provided which shows the effectiveness of using the resetting scheme for the row decoders. The book is addressed to professionals and students in the semi-conductor industry and especially those in circuit design.

I designed many cams at Polaroid Corporation in the 1960-1970 period then went on to teach mechanical engineering at various universities for 42 years until 2012. I usually taught courses on kinematics, dynamics, machine design, and stress analysis. Most of these courses included the design and analysis of cams. Over the years I taught, I also actively consulted for engineering companies all around the world on machine design problems, many of them involving cams. I have written six engineering textbooks. The kinematics book, Design of Machinery, has an introductory chapter on cam design and one on cam dynamics. Cam Design and Manufacturing Handbook, written late in my career, encapsulates all the art and science on cams that I have learned from study, experimentation and original research done with my graduate students, and my 50-years of experience in cam design.When I consulted with companies about cams, it was common to find that the engineers who had designed them had little idea or expertise on how to properly design a cam. This was not because they were bad engineers; they were not. I blame it on a lack of training in cam design in their engineering education. Having spent my career in the \"engineering ed biz,\" I know for a fact that most U.S. engineering curricula seldom mention cam systems to their students, let alone teach them anything useful about the subject.If cams are taught at all, they typically are included in a first course in kinematics. Many textbooks written for that course, if they have a cam chapter, it is almost always out-of-date and full of errors and misinformation. Even kinematics books written relatively recently continue to contain the same obsolete and misleading information on cam design that has been prevalent for the past 50 years. My kinematics book Design of Machinery is a notable exception; it is up-to-date.The above-described situation gave me the motivation to write this primer on cam design. I want to provide a simple, clearly written, short, and inexpensive description of how to (and how not to) design a cam, aimed at the engineer in industry that may occasionally be required to do so, but may have little or no training and experience for the task.This book is essentially a lightly abridged version of the first few chapters of my comprehensive and complete book on the subject, the Cam Design and Manufacturing Handbook. I believe that this information will serve to get an engineer to the point that he or she can design a simple cam-follower system that will work. If their career finds them needing to do more than occasional work of this sort, then they can consult my more comprehensive book and other tomes on the same subject. \r\n\r\n"}

Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is an effective design method for large engineering systems like aircraft, warships, and satellites, which require designers and engineers from various disciplines to cooperate with each other. MDO can be used to handle the conflicts that arise between these disciplines, and focuses on the optimal design of the system as a whole. However, it can also push designs to the brink of failure. In order to keep the system balanced, Reliability-based Design (RBD) must be incorporated into MDO. Consequently, new algorithms and methods have to be developed for RBMDO theory.This book provides an essential overview of MDO, RBD, and RBMDO and subsequently introduces key algorithms and methods by means of case analyses. In closing, it introduces readers to the design of DMSs and applies RBMDO methods to the design of the manned hull and the general concept design.

In this thesis fault location estimator for power distribution system using artificial neural network is developed for line to ground, line to line, line to line to ground and three phase to ground faults in distribution system. To develop this estimator one of rural radial power distribution feeder in Ethiopia, Oromia, Assela substation Gumguma line feeder is used as a test feeder. This feeder is simulated using ETAP software to generate data for different fault condition, with different fault resistance and loading conditions, which is the fault phase voltage and current. It is found that artificial neural networks are one of the alternate options in fault estimator design for distribution system where sufficient distribution network data are available with narrow fault location distance range from the substation. This has benefits in assisting for maintenance plan, saving efforts in fault location finding and economical benefits by reducing interruption time.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This property is determined by the structure of the fabric, which is characterized by fabric setting, linear density, the fabric cover, crimp percentage, mass per unit area of the fabric and so on. The main characteristic of fabric is the density of the yarns or yarn spacing. But sometimes the yarn diameter is also taken into consideration. It is known that the fabric with the same thread density may have different spacing between the threads because of the difference of the diameter. Also, fabric with different densities of yarn may have the same space between the yarn when smaller densities are combined with greater diameter. Therefore, the relative closeness of yarns depends on the density of the thread and their diameter. In this book fabric weight calculations are used from the design point of view as they are important in determining the rate at which yarn will be consumed at the loom as well as the efficiency of the weaving.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The theory that blew your mind in Biocentrism and Beyond Biocentrism is back, with brand-new research revealing that its radical claims might not be so radical after all.  What is consciousness? Why are we here? Where did it all come from--the laws of nature, the stars, the universe? Humans have been asking these questions forever, but science hasn't succeeded in providing many answers--until now. In The Grand Biocentric Design, Robert Lanza, one of Time Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People,\" is joined by theoretical physicist Matej Pavsič and astronomer Bob Berman to shed light on the big picture that has long eluded philosophers and scientists alike. This engaging, mind-stretching exposition of how the history of physics has led us to Biocentrism--the idea that life creates reality--takes readers on a step-by-step adventure into the great science breakthroughs of the past centuries, from Newton to the weirdness of quantum theory, culminating in recent revelations that will challenge everything you think you know about our role in the universe. This book offers the most complete explanation of the science behind Biocentrism to date, delving into the origins of the memorable principles introduced in previous books in this series, as well as introducing new principles that complete the theory. The authors dive deep into topics including consciousness, time, and the evidence that our observations--or even knowledge in our minds--can affect how physical objects behave.  The Grand Biocentric Design is a one-of-a-kind, groundbreaking explanation of how the universe works, and an exploration of the science behind the astounding fact that time, space, and reality itself, all ultimately depend upon us.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Micro-mixer with obstacles located on the channel wall as well as waveform configurations are used to enhance mixing in the channel, so as to reduce the mixing length. Micro channels with different geometric layout and with different shapes and sizes of obstacles such as rectangular, triangular and semicircular, are analyzed for their mixing length. The triangular obstacles within the T as well as Y channel gave minimum mixing length for the same distance between the obstacles. Also T and Y channel with 1w spacing between waveform gave minimum mixing length. A proof of experiment is carried out to show mixing of fluids from two inlets. It is observed that mixing length required for Y shape channel without obstacle is more than Y shape channel with triangular obstacles. In Y shape channel with triangular obstacles, turbulence created at tip of obstacles which increases mixing rate.\r\n                    \r\n"}

A simple Genetic Algorithm(GA)method has been applied to various single-input- single-output(SISO) & Multi-Input-Multi-Output(MIMO)process models for obtaining optimum PID parameters for minimization of error performance indices. The proposed method can choose the best PID parameters for each generation. Then, using the reproduction, crossover and mutation to create the new population for other PID parameters, the optimum PID parameter are obtained.The proposed method is compared with Ho et al., Ziegler-Nichols and Wang et al. It is observed that the results using proposed method are better in terms of IAE, ISE and ITAE. A simple and effective design methodology of decentralized PID controllers is developed based on extension of the GA based SISO controllers. Initially the system is decoupled using decoupler matrix and the first-order-plus-delay-time(FOPDT) model of each subsystems is obtained. FOPDT model obtained from decoupler, retains the unit characteristics of systems. A genetic approach is applied to obtain the parameters of the Decentralized PID controller.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The mobility is the major factor that makes the armoured vehicle move freely and rapidly over the terrains. Currently, wheeled vehicles and tracked vehicles are used for off-road conditions.The reconfigurable wheel contains triangular configuration and circular configuration which automatically changed with respect to the speed of the vehicle. The triangular configuration will give more traction and stability while the circular configuration will provide easy mobility. In this paper, the various components required for the proposed mechanism are designed using CATIA V5 R6 and detailed stress and displacement analysis are carried out using ANSYS R18.2. The optimum design parameters are obtained and simulation of the reconfigurable wheel is performed. The reconfigurable wheel takes a triangular configuration when the speed is below 20kmph and transformed into circular configuration while the speed increases beyond 20kmph which assures stability and mobility of the armoured vehicles.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Helical coil configuration is very effective for heat exchangers and chemical reactors because they can accommodate a large heat transfer area in a small space, with high heat transfer coefficients. Conventional heat exchangers are large in size and heat transfer rate is also less and in conventional heat exchanger dead zone is produced which reduces the heat transfer rate and to create turbulence in conventional heat exchanger some external means is required and the fluid in conventional heat exchanger is not in continuous motion with each other. Tube in tube helical coil heat exchanger provides a compact shape with its geometry offering more fluid contact and eliminating the dead zone, increasing the turbulence and hence the heat transfer rate. As helical coil heat exchangers have compact size and higher heat transfer coefficient they are widely used in industrial applications such as food preservation, refrigeration, process.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Rapid advances in information processing, communication and sensing technologies have enabled more and more devices to be provided with embedded processors, networking capabilities and sensors. For the field of estimation and control, it is now possible to consider an architecture in which many simple components communicate and cooperate to achieve a joint team goal. This distributed architecture promises much in terms of performance, reliability and simplicity of design. However, at the same time, it requires extending the traditional theories of control, communication and computation and, in fact, looking at a unified picture of the three fields. The chief idea explored in this book is the joint design of information flow and the control law. While traditional control design has concentrated on calculating the optimal control input by assuming a particular information flow between the components, our approach seeks to synthesize the optimal information flow along with the optimal control law that satisfies the constraints of the information flow. As we demonstrate in the book, the joint design of information flow and the optimal control input satisfying the constraints of that information flow yields large improvements in performance over simply trying to fit traditional design theories on distributed systems.\r\n                    \r\n"}

However, this has led to a stream of mutually-reinforcing negative consequences, including longer commutes to a variety of destinations, greater traffic and increased pollution, to name a few. In recent years, Sustainable Urban Development (SUD) has been considered one of the prevalent theories and policies within urban-planning literature, devoting a major portion of said literature to the subject. Tied closely to this is the idea of facilitating a resurgence of the neighborhood. The new concept of the neighborhood within SUD harkens back to some of the key facets of older neighborhoods; specifically, credence is given to the core idea that a neighborhood should meet the personal and social requirements of their respective residents. The present research is an effort towards analyzing sustainable neighborhood development aspects, in the form of a comparison between neighborhoods over time.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Of course, not all nonlinear control methods apply to electrical AC machines, but some of them are accessible. In this respect, special focus is made on the topics of sensorless nonlinear state high gain observers, sampled output data measurements, adaptive and robust nonlinear controllers, and output feedback controllers. The most significant developments in these topics, and their practical applications to electrical system control, are described clearly in this book, as well as some new research topics. This book is intended for a wide variety of readers, including academia and industry researchers, graduate students and their professors, engineers, and practitioners. Although it includes many aspects of the theory, it is nonetheless beneficial to practitioners who will be able to use the methods without necessarily understanding every single detail of the theory. It will also be useful for new researchers in the field of AC machines control. For students, the main prerequisites are undergraduate courses on linear and nonlinear system control, on electric machines.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The powerful design of the system dynamics notation helps to define the interfering dependencies in highly dynamic systems like businesses. In order to exploit all features modern business infrastructures offer, one can enrich those models with real data from various sources. Furthermore, simulation on data and models give the opportunity to dive deeply into a system's behaviour without the constraint of existence. The goal of state-of-the-art business software is therefore to minimise the effort that has to be taken to combine static analysis and real-time event and business data in order to gain insight into existing and future business systems and facilitate decisions. The aim of this book in particular is to describe the development of a web-based system dynamics modelling tool, as well as architectural decisions that had to be taken into account from a software engineering perspective. Secondly, the applicability of such a modelling tool in not only system dynamics, but also in more generic scenarios will be discussed.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The aims is to produce a path that can be used to facilitate retrieval of songs from an existing database, the specific objectives are to convert hums into a set of fundamental frequency (fo), converting fundamental frequency ( fo) to music notes and there after converts music notes into music note intervals. Finite Impulse response (FIR), a major type of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) was implemented for filtering out perturbation found in the fundamental frequencies. A set of algorithms was computed using Java software to generate modal frequencies of music notes and music note intervals. Comparing the music note intervals of the hummed query with the music note intervals of songs from an existing database, gives the desired retrieval of hymns.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Such cells are of contemporary interest because they offer substantially higher charge storage capacity than state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. Batteries based on metallic anodes are currently considered impractical and unsafe because recharge of the anode causes physical and chemical instabilities that produce dendritic deposition of the metal leading to catastrophic failure via thermal runaway. This thesis utilizes a combination of chemical synthesis, physical & electrochemical analysis, and materials theory to investigate structure, ion transport properties, and electrochemical behaviors of hybrid electrolytes and interfacial phases designed to prevent such instabilities. In particular, it demonstrates that relatively low-modulus electrolytes composed of cross-linked networks of polymer-grafted nanoparticles stabilize electrodeposition of reactive metals by multiple processes, including screening electrode electrolyte interactions at electrochemical interfaces and by regulating ion transport in tortuous nanopores. This discovery is significant because it overturns a longstanding perception in the field of nanoparticle-polymer hybrid electrolytes that only solid electrolytes with mechanical modulus higher than that of the metal electrode are able to stabilize electrodeposition of reactive metals.\r\n\r\n"}

Rising applications like wireless communications persist to challenge microwave or RF filters with increasingly further rigorous requirements. The latest development in new materials and fabrication technologies such as monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) and micromachining technology, have stimulated the rapid development of new microstrip filters for microwave and RF applications. The manuscript presented here is a novel H- Shape microstrip filter for multi-band applications. We represent five microstrip filters each having H -Shape but the substrate material is changed in each design. On the basis of proposed design we investigate the effect of different material on Insertion loss, reflection coefficient, VSWR and Q factor.

Theoretically, direct-conversion receivers offer the advantage of omitting the intermediate stage required in heterodyne architectures, thereby greatly reducing the hardware complexity of receiver design. In this research, a higher order filtering technique is proposed to attenuate out-of-band blockers in a direct-conversion receiver without deteriorating the desired signal present in the band of interest. The proposed filter structure is based on a current-mode biquadratic pipe filter cell, which originally allows the implementation of only all-pole filter functions such as Butterworth. With the aim to achieve a flat magnitude response in pass-band and steep rate of attenuation in transition-band, the base structure is modified to implement higher order Inverse-Chebyshev transfer function, which requires realization of arbitrary complex zeros in the stopband. A third order prototype has been realized in a 0.18μm CMOS process using 1.8V supply voltage.\r\n                    \r\n"}

While the rewards can be very high, the process of technological innovation (of which R&D is the first phase) is complex and risky. The majority of R&D projects fail to provide the expected financial results, and the successful projects (25 to 50 percent) must also pay for the projects that are unsuccessful or terminated early by management. In addition, the originator of R&D cannot appropriate all the benefits of its innovations and must share them with customers, the public, and even competitors. For these reasons, a company's R&D efforts must be carefully organized, controlled, evaluated, and managed.The creativity of the engineers is encouraged by the management. It is considered as the starting point for technological breakthroughs for new products and applications.The objective of academic and institutional R&D is to obtain new knowledge, which may or may not be applied to practical uses.

In fact, Canada has a history of constructing tall wood buildings out of heavy timber and brick elements, reaching up to nine storeys. In the early 20th century, with the increase in reinforced concrete and structural steel research and construction, and with growing concerns over fire and durability, the structural use of wood fell out of common use in tall buildings. This trend is beginning to reverse, however. In the last few decades, the world has seen a resurgence of mass timber products and systems that are paving the way for tall wood buildings. This triggered an initiative by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to support tall wood building demonstration projects to enhance Canada's position as a global leader in wood building construction, by showcasing the application and performance of advanced wood technologies. The Technical Guide for the Design and Construction of Tall Wood Buildings in Canada has been prepared to assist architects, engineers, code consultants, developers, building owners, and Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) in understanding the unique issues to be addressed when developing and constructing tall wood buildings.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Thus new kind of security is required to find that are not accurately from the traditional backgrounds. But the traditional cryptographic models are computationally cost effective, produce additional storage overheads, and also generate the less secure cipher for storage. Therefore in order to resolve the issues in cryptographic security a new methodology is required to develop. We have successfully implemented this hybrid approach in .NET environment. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our technique and ensure security by means of authentication, confidentiality and integrity.

Then, the varactor diodes were modeled by analytic equations containing empirical coefficients. These expressions have been introduced for the first time for the voltage dependency of equivalent capacitance (CEq) and series resistance (REq) and can be used as a general model to represent the nonlinear behavior of GaN based varactors. For small-signal operation, all of the developed equations describing REq and CEq are only bias voltage and device geometry dependent.\r\n                    \r\n"}

They go quietly findings their ways into prevailing chaos. At the city level, each and every resident is a pedestrian, but treated as a neglected road user. A recent study conducted in Indian Cities states that more than 20% of the road accidents involve pedestrian. Hence safety of pedestrian is a basic step to create safer city. A report entitled \"Road Safety in India: Challenges and Opportunities\" March 2009 states that road traffic fatalities have been increasing at about 8% annually for the last ten years. About 60% of all fatalities in urban areas belong to pedestrians. Hence pedestrian safety is a challenge for transport planners, traffic engineers, town planners, urban local bodies and policy makers to make the city safer.\r\n                    \r\n"}

While the majority of existing broadband wireless networks are still exclusively limited to single hop access, it is the ability of these networks to forward data frames over multi-hop wireless routes which enabled them to easily extend the network coverage area. Unfortunately, achieving good multihop throughput has been challenging due to several factors, such as lossy wireless links caused by interference from concurrent transmissions, and intra-path interference caused by transmissions on successive hops along a single path. In this work, we focus on the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX mesh multi-hop and multi-channel. To maximize the network performance of mesh networks (e.g., throughput), it is essential to consider a cross-layer design, exploiting the dependency between protocol layers such as the routing network layer and the scheduling resource allocation MAC layer. Therefore this book considers a cross-layer design approach for designing efficient wireless mesh multi-hop networks.\r\n                    \r\n"}

We evaluate several cryptosystems in the context of multimedia data which shows the weaknesses of standards encryption algorithm named Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

To design a hybrid renewable energy source (RES) system, different power electronic converter (PEC) topologies are discussed and highlighted in this book. Among all, non-isolated multi input DC-DC power converters are extensively utilized for its simple structure and it does not require a high frequency transformer. In this book, different power electronic converters are integrated together by sharing and merging power converter components between the DC-DC converters to develop a hybrid power converter. A hybrid system necessitates an individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control algorithm to track the maximum power point (MPP) from the high penetration of RES. As the number of control algorithms increases, this can escalate the system intricacy and its implementation. To overcome these flaws, a single MPPT control algorithms are discussed and highlighted in this book for extracting MPP concurrently.

This level can be dropped to 10-20% if smarter and greener buildings are incorporated around the world. Buildings can be made smart by using dynamic movement (rotation), sensors and greener by deploying solar energy to conserve power. In this research, different innovative solar tracking techniques will be deployed on different structures (non-rotating and rotating). By means of simulation (LabVIEW) and by comparing results we will be able to define the most suitable framework of solar deployment and will be able to define whether a dynamic building is more worthy than a stationary one in terms of cost and conservation of energy. The following research introduces topics like rotating buildings, different techniques of tracking the sun and rise of concern in the world about greener and smarter buildings. Through my research, I would like to initiate a movement in the direction of innovative, greener and smarter buildings. As the world, doesn't realize that wasting power needlessly will come back to haunt us severely in the next few coming years. -M.Rehan-\r\n                    \r\n"}

It focuses on novel and precise operators of aggregation, inference, and defuzzification leading to flexible Mamdani-type and logical-type systems that can achieve the required accuracy using a less complex rule base. The individual chapters describe various aspects of interpretability, including appropriate selection of the structure of a fuzzy system, focusing on improving the interpretability of fuzzy systems designed using both gradient-learning and evolutionary algorithms. It also demonstrates how to eliminate various system components, such as inputs, rules and fuzzy sets, whose reduction does not adversely affect system accuracy. It illustrates the performance of the developed algorithms and methods with commonly used benchmarks. The book provides valuable tools for possible applications in many fields including expert systems, automatic control and robotics.\r\n\r\n"}

In order to have a normal traffic flow, road engineers must have to give priority to safety in their design such as consistent geometric design. In addition to driver error, roadway factors and the combined driver error and inconsistent geometric design are the major contributors to road safety issue. For a long period of time, road safety analysis was carried out with a traditional technique of sliding scale analysis. Which have drawbacks of incapability of using the latest technologies and also, tedious and unclear data acquisition and analysis. But, in this book the latest technique of using Geographical Information System (GIS) have been adopted for road safety analysis. Basically, the application of ArcGIS software has been implemented for the detection of crash intensive prone locations and identification of inconsistent geometric design segment of the road. In this book, Crash Hot-Spot locations and inconsistent geometric design segments of the road had been merged together to analyze the impacts of geometric design on road safety.\r\n                    \r\n"}

To achieve flexible frequency synthesis, the two essential components namely Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) followed by the frequency divider must be power efficient and operate at high frequency. The frequency divider is a basic block in a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) synthesizer for the conversion from high to low frequencies. Prescaler is one of the most vital parts of frequency-divider as it works at high speed and consumes maximum power. The objective of this research work is to design divide by 'N' prescaler and divide by N\/N+1 dual modulus prescalers for various low power applications. In this thesis, we have carried a detailed analysis on the speed and power consumption of the digital dividers. We performed design and implementation of low power divide by 'N' prescalers. Architecture of the divide by 'N' prescalers using hybrid master slave flip flop has been explained. Based on this architecture divide by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 prescaler circuits have been successfully designed at 5 GHz operating frequency.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Poultry production and in particular indigenous chicken (IC) production play a significant role in the economic and social life of these resource-poor households, contributing to cheap source of animal proteins and cash income. Indigenous chickens are present whenever there are human settlements and their economic strength lies in their low cost of production which is a characteristic of the resource-poor rural households. Two of the major challenges facing layer chicken farmers are; the high cost of electric energy used for lighting\/heating poultry houses, heating incubators and the cost of supplying sufficient water to the poultry farm. By providing an alternative cheaper source of electricity for the farmers, this inherent costs will be eliminated or reduced hence boosting profits and enhancing growth. This research proposes designing a Hybrid solar and wind electricity generation system to either supplement or replace the electric power from the national grid of a chicken farm.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The whole text is used in the senior capstone design course that includes a complete design project, starting from selecting a market to creating a working prototype.What is design? If you search the literature for an answer to that question, you will find about as many definitions as there are designs. Perhaps the reason is that the process of design is such a common human experience. Webster's dictionary says that to design is \"to fashion after a plan,\" but that leaves out the essential fact that to design is to create something that has never been. Certainly an engineering designer practices design by that definition, but so does an artist, a sculptor, a composer, a playwright, or any another creative member of our society.Thus, although engineers are not the only people who design things, it is true that the professional practice of engineering is largely concerned with design; it is often said that design is the essence of engineering.The expanded boundaries and responsibilities of engineering create almost unlimited opportunities for you.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The deep understanding of basic concepts gives you the power to develop a new application aspect, which is very well taken care of in this book by using simple language in explaining the concepts. In the VLSI world, the importance of hardware description languages cannot be ignored as the designing of such dense and complex circuits is not possible without them. Both Verilog and VHDL languages are used here for designing. The current needs of high performance integrated circuits including low power devices and new emerging materials which can play a very important role in achieving new functionalities, are the most interesting part of the book. The testing of VLSI circuits becomes more crucial than the designing of the circuits in this nanometer technology era. The role of fault simulation algorithms is very well explained and its implementation using Verilog is the key aspect of this book.  This book is well organized in 20 chapters. Chapter 1 emphasizes on uses of FPGA on various image processing and biomedical applications. Then the descriptions enlighten the basic understanding of digital design from the perspective of HDL in Chapters 2 to 5. The performance enhancement with alternate material or geometry for silicon-based FET designs are focused in chapter 6 and 7. Chapter 8 and 9 describes the study of bimolecular interactions with Bio-sensing FETs. Chapter 10 to 13 deals with advanced FET structures available in various shapes, materials such as nanowire, HFET etc. and their comparison in terms of device performance metrics calculation. Chapter 14 to 18 describes different application-specific VLSI design techniques and challenges for analog and digital circuit design. Chapter 19 explains the VLSI testability issues with the description of simulation and its categorization into logic and fault simulation for test pattern generation using Verilog HDL. Chapter 20 deals with a secured VLSI design with hardware obfuscation by hiding the IC's structure and function which makes it much more difficult to reverse engineer by the adversaries.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Different engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, materials, computer and process engineering, provide the foundation for the design and development of improved structures, materials and processes. The modern design cycle is characterized by the interaction between various disciplines and a strong shift to computer-based approaches where only a few experiments are conducted for verification purposes. A major driver for this development is the increased demand for cost reduction, which is also linked to environmental demands. In the transportation industry (e.g. automotive or aerospace), the demand for higher fuel efficiency is related to reduced operational costs and less environmental damage. One way to fulfil such requirements is lighter structures and\/or improved processes for energy conversion. Another emerging area is the interaction of classical engineering with the health and medical sector.\r\n\r\n"}

With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.\r\n\r\n"}

Most MEMS experts have a background in electronics, where circuit models or behavioral models (i.e. lumped-parameter models) of devices are preferred to field models. This is certainly convenient in terms of preliminary design, e.g. in the prototyping stage. However, design optimization should also take into account fine-sizing effects on device behavior and therefore be based on distributed-parameter models, such as finite-element models. The book shows how the combination of automated optimal design and field-based models can produce powerful design toolboxes for MEMS. It especially focuses on illustrating theoretical concepts with practical examples, fostering comprehension through a problem-solving approach. By comparing the results obtained using different methods, readers will learn to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses. In addition, special emphasis is given to evolutionary computing and nature-inspired optimization strategies, the effectiveness of which has already been amply demonstrated. Given its scope, the book provides PhD students, researchers and professionals in the area of computer-aided analysis with a comprehensive, yet concise and practice-oriented guide to MEMS design and optimization. To benefit most from the book, readers should have a basic grasp of electromagnetism, vector analysis and numerical methods.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The authors interconnect various technical tools and methods to capture the different properties between cyber and physical layers. Part II of this book bridges the gap between cryptography and control-theoretic tools. It develops a bespoke crypto-control framework to address security and resiliency in control and estimation problems where the outsourcing of computations is possible. Part III of this book bridges the gap between game theory and control theory and develops interdependent impact-aware security defense strategies and cyber-aware resilient control strategies.With the rapid development of smart cities, there is a growing need to integrate the physical systems, ranging from large-scale infrastructures to small embedded systems, with networked communications. The integration of the physical and cyber systems forms Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), enabling the use of digital information and control technologies to improve the monitoring, operation, and planning of the systems. Despite these advantages, they are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, which aim to damage the physical layer through the cyber network.This book also uses case studies from autonomous systems, communication-based train control systems, cyber manufacturing, and robotic systems to illustrate the proposed methodologies. These case studies aim to motivate readers to adopt a cross-layer system perspective toward security and resilience issues of large and complex systems and develop domain-specific solutions to address CPS challenges.A comprehensive suite of solutions to a broad range of technical challenges in secure and resilient control systems are described in this book (many of the findings in this book are useful to anyone working in cybersecurity). Researchers, professors, and advanced-level students working in computer science and engineering will find this book useful as a reference or secondary text. Industry professionals and military workers interested in cybersecurity will also want to purchase this book.\r\n\r\n"}

It highlights two main points that are often neglected in other books: energy-efficiency and spatial random distribution of wireless devices. Effective methods in stochastic geometry for the design and analysis of wireless networks are also explored.After providing a comprehensive review of existing studies in the literature, the authors point out the challenges that are worth further investigation. Then, they introduce several novel solutions for cooperative wireless network protocols that reduce energy consumption and address spatial random distribution of wireless nodes. For each solution, the book offers a clear system model and problem formulation, details of the proposed cooperative schemes, comprehensive performance analysis, and extensive numerical and simulation results that validate the analysis and examine the performance under various conditions.

As a result, a broad range of special-purpose design processes has been developed in the last several years to tackle the challenges of these specific application domains. In this context, in early 2012 the IEEE-FIPA Design Process Documentation Template SC0097B was defined, which facilitates the representation of design processes and method fragments through the use of standardized templates, thus supporting the creation of easily sharable repositories and facilitating the composition of new design processes.Following this standardization approach, this book gathers the documentations of some of the best-known agent-oriented design processes. After an introductory section, describing the goal of the book and the existing IEEE FIPA standard for design process documentation, thirteen processes (including the widely known Open UP, the de facto standard in object-oriented software engineering) are documented by their original creators or other well-known scientists working in the field. As a result, this is the first work to adopt a standard, unified descriptive approach for documenting different processes, making it much easier to study the individual processes, to rigorously compare them, and to apply them in industrial projects.While there are a few books on the market describing the individual agent-oriented design processes, none of them presents all the processes, let alone in the same format. With this handbook, for the first time, researchers as well as professional software developers looking for an overview as well as for detailed and standardized descriptions of design processes will find a comprehensive presentation of the most important agent-oriented design processes, which will be an invaluable resource when developing solutions in various application areas.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies.  Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum's Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher's striking advice for observational studies, \"make your theories elaborate.\"  The second edition of his book, Observational Studies, was published by Springer in 2002.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Yet this has also created new challenges and opportunities for map projection scientists. Small Scale Map Projection Design focuses on numerical map projection research, and is written from the perspective of the map projection user. It demonstrates how advances in the measurement of map projection distortion and in the development of low error map projections can help map makers decide what type of map projection is best for their purpose, and shows how they can eventually design their own tailor-made map projections.A number of significant contributions have been made to the subject over recent decades, and these are reviewed along with a substantial amount of original, unpublished material. This theoretical material is tied to practical applications and issues such as map projection use, optimization and selection, which are far too often carried out with simple rules-of-thumb methods.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The modeling, simulation and application of marine vehicles like underwater robotic vehicles (URVs) are multidisciplinary, and combine mathematical aspects from various engineering disciplines. URVs such as remotely operated vehicle (ROVs) are used for a wide range of applications such as exploring the extreme depths of our ocean, where a hard-wired link is still required. Most ROVs operate in extreme environments with uncertainties in the model prior to control system design. However, the method involved extensive testing before the system model could be used for any control actions. It has been found that the range of error can be extensive and uncertain in actual, continuously varying conditions. Hence, it is important to address the problem of reliance on model testing using different modeling approaches. In this book, approaches such as WAMIT, ANSYS-CFX, STAR CCM+, MATLAB and Simulink are used to model parameters for ROVs. A few benchmark models are provided, allowing researchers and students to explore and test different control schemes. Given its scope, the book offers a valuable reference guide for postgraduate and undergraduate students engaged in modeling and simulation for ROV control. \r\n\r\n"}

A ballasted track is commonly used for several reasons, including economic considerations, load bearing capacity, rapid drainage and ease of maintenance. Given the ever-increasing demand for trains to carry heavier axle loads at greater speeds, traditional design and construction must undergo inevitable changes for sustainable performance. Ballast is an unbounded granular assembly that displaces when subjected to repeated train loading affecting track stability. During heavy haul operations, ballast progressively deteriorates and the infiltration of fluidized fines (mud pumping) from the underlying substructure and subgrade decreases its shear strength and also impedes drainage, while increasing track deformation and associated maintenance.Features: serves as a useful guide to assist the practitioner in new track design as well as remediating existing tracks.research discussed in this book has made considerable impact on the railway industry.resulting from collaborative research between academia and industry, incorporating sophisticated laboratory tests, computational modelling and field studies.This book presents a comprehensive procedure for the design of ballasted tracks based on a rational approach that combines extensive laboratory testing, computational modelling and field measurements conducted over the past two decades.

Successful use of a simulation model, however, requires careful interrogation of the model through systematic computer experiments. While specific theoretical\/mathematical examinations of computer experiment design are available, those interested in applying proposed methodologies need a practical presentation and straightforward guidance on analyzing and interpreting experiment results. Written by authors with strong academic reputations and real-world practical experience, Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments is exactly the kind of treatment you need. The authors blend a sound, modern statistical approach with extensive engineering applications and clearly delineate the steps required to successfully model a problem and provide an analysis that will help find the solution. Part I introduces the design and modeling of computer experiments and the basic concepts used throughout the book. Part II focuses on the design of computer experiments. The authors present the most popular space-filling designs - like Latin hypercube sampling and its modifications and uniform design - including their definitions, properties, construction and related generating algorithms. Part III discusses the modeling of data from computer experiments. Here the authors present various modeling techniques and discuss model interpretation, including sensitivity analysis. An appendix reviews the statistics and mathematics concepts needed, and numerous examples clarify the techniques and their implementation. The complexity of real physical systems means that there is usually no simple analytic formula that sufficiently describes the phenomena. Useful both as a textbook and professional reference, this book presents the techniques you need to design and model computer experiments for practical problem solving.\r\n                    \r\n"}

From a modelling perspective, there are advantages in integrating object-oriented analysis and design to databases as well as to visualisation capabilities of GIS.Object-Oriented Design for Temporal GIS explores the major components of the object-oriented analysis and design methods, how they can be used for modelling spatio-temporal data, and how these components are developed and maintained within a GIS. It also offers practical guidance to object-oriented methods by demonstrating the feasibility of applying such methods to issues involved in handling spatio-temporal data. The author demonstrates how this knowledge might be used in a wide range of applications such as political boundary record maintenance (historical data), disease incidence rate analysis in epidemics (diffusion rate), and environmental studies of climate change (time-series data). This understanding contributes to the development of theory in GIS and improves the design of GIS to support the modelling of semantics, space and time elements of geographical information.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It presents the micro-combined cooling, heating & power systems Stirling engines & renewable energy sources (mCCHP-SE-RES) systems in an accessible manner both for the public at large, and for professionals who conceive, design or commercialise such systems or their components. The high performance levels of these systems are demonstrated within the final chapter by the results of an experiment in which a house is equipped with a mCCHP-SE-RES system. The reader is also familiarized with the conceptual, technical and legal aspects of modern domestic energy systems; the components that constitute these systems; and advanced algorithms for achieving the structural and technical design of such systems.In residential buildings, satisfying demands of durable development has gradually evolved from necessity to obligation and institutionalisation. Consequently a major paradigm change has appeared in the supply of energy to residential buildings, from the centralised production of energy using fossil fuels to the decentralised production of energy using local renewable sources. Furthermore, on the energy system market, energy micro systems which use renewable energy sources are increasingly commercialised. From among these, the mCCHP-SE-RES systems are particularly striking because they offer a high performance and they enhance the relationship between humans and the environment.

To facilitate referencing the various chapters we have divided the textbook into three parts: Part I covers Design, Build and Drive a Rover. It includes seven chapters that contains most of the technical content required for the students to design, build and drive their rovers under RC control during the fall quarter. We have included Chapter 2 on Development Teams because student design teams often have difficulty functioning smoothly. In addition to the mission oriented content, we have added Chapter 7 on 3D Printing.Part II is titled Design, Build an Autonomous Rover. It contains the content for the winter quarter, during which the students are formed into teams of four students who design, build and autonomously drive their Rover on a specified mission. Part II contains four chapters that provide the content that the students can reference as they complete their assignment.Finally Part III is titled Engineering Skills. It includes nine chapters that contain content often covered in more traditional Introduction to Engineering courses. We recommend that students refer to these chapters, as they consider a career in Engineering. Of particular importance is Chapter 13 titled A Student Survival Guide, which provides a systematic approach to successfully completing your engineering studies. We also strongly recommend that you read Chapter 18 on Engineering Ethics and Design, which is focused on issues that arise in engineering. Finally, Chapter 20 provides a brief description of the interface between Engineering and Society.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The targeted audience is engineers, managers and advanced students who are involved in the design of cyber-physical systems and are willing to spend some time outside the silo of their daily work in order to widen their background and appreciation for the pervasive problems of system complexity.In the past, design of a process-control system (now called cyber-physical systems) was more of an art than an engineering endeavor. The software technology of that time was concerned primarily with functional correctness and did not pay much attention to the temporal dimension of program execution, which is as important as functional correctness when a physical process must be controlled. In the ensuing years, many problems in the design of cyber-physical systems were simplified. But with an increase in the functional requirements and system size, the complexity problems have appeared again in a different disguise. A sound understanding of the complexity problem requires some insight in cognition, human problem solving, psychology, and parts of philosophy.This book presents the essence of the author's thinking about complexity, accumulated over the past forty years. \r\n\r\n"}

It includes coverage of the selection and placement of actuators and sensors for such distributed-parameter systems. The models for distributed parameter systems are coupled ordinary\/partial differential equations. Approximations to the governing equations, often of very high order, are required and this complicates both controller design and optimization of the hardware locations. Control system and estimator performance depends not only on the controller\/estimator design but also on the location of the hardware. In helping the reader choose the best location for actuators and sensors, the analysis provided in this book is crucial because neither intuition nor trial-and-error is foolproof, especially where multiple sensors and actuators are required, and moving hardware can be difficult and costly. The mechatronic approach advocated, in which controller design is integrated with actuator location, can lead to better performance without increased cost. Similarly, better estimation can be obtained with carefully placed sensors. The text shows how proper hardware placement varies depending on whether, disturbances are present, whether the response should be reduced to an initial condition or whether controllability and\/or observability have to be optimized.  This book is aimed at non-specialists interested in learning controller design for distributed-parameter systems and the material presented has been used for student teaching. The relevant basic systems theory is presented and followed by a description of controller synthesis using lumped approximations. Numerical algorithms useful for efficient implementation in real engineering systems and practical computational challenges are also described and discussed.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Continuing to follow a logical pattern for system design, Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach, Second Edition removes the mystery from operating system design and consolidates the body of material into a systematic discipline. It presents a hierarchical design paradigm that organizes major operating system components in an orderly, understandable manner. The book guides readers through the construction of a conventional process-based operating system using practical, straightforward primitives. It gives the implementation details of one set of primitives, usually the most popular set. Once readers understand how primitives can be implemented on conventional hardware, they can then easily implement alternative versions.The text begins with a bare machine and proceeds step-by-step through the design and implementation of Xinu, which is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I\/O functions. The Xinu code runs on many hardware platforms. This second edition has been completely rewritten to contrast operating systems for RISC and CISC processors. Encouraging hands-on experimentation, the book provides updated code throughout and examples for two low-cost experimenter boards: BeagleBone Black from ARM and Galileo from Intel.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Following an introduction to the field, the second chapter addresses drilling fluids, as well as optimal mud weight, hole cleaning, hydraulic optimization, and methods to handle circulation losses. A relatively large chapter on geomechanics follows, presenting methods for wellbore fracture and collapse modeling, including methods to interpret caliper logs. Contains a new generalized fracture model suitable for deep-water drillingThe start of any well design is to collect data and establish the design premises. To this end, Chapter Four presents well integrity issues, methods to select depths of casing seats, and also some important completion and production requirements. This encourages the design of a plan to last for the entire life of the well, defining loads that it may be subjected to at later stages. Chapters Five and Six describe actual well design in the North Sea and a sub-sea high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well. Chapter Seven also addresses issues related to well integrity, and presents statistics regarding failures with production and injection wells.

To do so, it covers formal definitions about patterns, patterns mining, type of patterns and the usefulness of patterns in the knowledge discovery process. As it is described within the book, the discovery process suffers from both high runtime and memory requirements, especially when high dimensional datasets are analyzed. To solve this issue, many pruning strategies have been developed. Nevertheless, with the growing interest in the storage of information, more and more datasets comprise such a dimensionality that the discovery of interesting patterns becomes a challenging process. In this regard, the use of evolutionary algorithms for mining pattern enables the computation capacity to be reduced, providing sufficiently good solutions.This book offers a survey on evolutionary computation with particular emphasis on genetic algorithms and genetic programming. Also included is an analysis of the set of quality measures most widely used in the field of pattern mining with evolutionary algorithms. This book serves as a review of the most important evolutionary algorithms for pattern mining. It considers the analysis of different algorithms for mining different type of patterns and relationships between patterns, such as frequent patterns, infrequent patterns, patterns defined in a continuous domain, or even positive and negative patterns.A completely new problem in the pattern mining field, mining of exceptional relationships between patterns, is discussed. In this problem the goal is to identify patterns which distribution is exceptionally different from the distribution in the complete set of data records. Finally, the book deals with the subgroup discovery task, a method to identify a subgroup of interesting patterns that is related to a dependent variable or target attribute. This subgroup of patterns satisfies two essential conditions: interpretability and interestingness.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It begins by illustrating how to develop a Third Normal Form data model where data is placed \"where it belongs\". The reader is taken step-by-step through the Normalization process, first using a simple then a more complex set of data requirements. Next, usage analysis for each Logical Data Model is reviewed and a Physical Data Model is produced that will satisfy user performance requirements. Finally, each Physical Data Model is used as input to create databases using both Microsoft Access and SQL Server.The book next shows how to use an industry-leading data modeling tool to define and manage logical and physical data models, and how to create Data Definition Language statements to create or update a database running in SQL Server, Oracle, or other type of DBMS.One chapter is devoted to illustrating how Microsoft Access can be used to create user interfaces to review and update underlying tables in that database as well as tables residing in SQL Server or Oracle.For users involved with Cyber activity or support, one chapter illustrates how to extract records of interest from a log file using PERL, then shows how to load these extracted records into one or more SQL Server \"tracking\" tables adding status flags for analysts to use when reviewing activity of interest. These status flags are used to flag\/mark collected records as \"Reviewed\", \"Pending\" (currently being analyzed) and \"Resolved\". The last chapter then shows how to build a web-based GUI using PHP to query these tracking tables and allow an analyst to review new activity, flag items that need to be investigated, and finally flag items that have been investigated and resolved. Note that the book has complete code\/scripts for both PERL and the PHP GUI.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This type of optimization is generally called multi-objective or multi-criterion optimization. The area of research that applies evolutionary methodologies to multi-objective optimization is of special and growing interest. It brings a viable computational solution to many real-world problems. Generally, multi-objective engineering problems do not have a straightforward optimal design. These kinds of problems usually inspire several solutions of equal efficiency, which achieve different trade-offs. Decision makers' preferences are normally used to select the most adequate design. Such preferences may be dictated before or after the optimization takes place. They may also be introduced interactively at different levels of the optimization process. Multi-objective optimization methods can be subdivided into classical and evolutionary. The classical methods usually aim at a single solution while the evolutionary methods provide a whole set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. Evolutionary Multi-Objective System Design: Theory and Applicationsprovides a representation of the state-of-the-art in evolutionary multi-objective optimization research area and related new trends. It reports many innovative designs yielded by the application of such optimization methods. It also presents the application of multi-objective optimization to the following problems: Embrittlement of stainless steel coated electrodesLearning fuzzy rules from imbalanced datasets Combining multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with collective intelligenceFuzzy gain scheduling controlSmart placement of roadside units in vehicular networksCombining multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with quasi-simplex local searchDesign of robust substitution boxesProtein structure prediction problemCore assignment for efficient network-on-chip-based system design\r\n\r\n"}

This book focuses on the crucial connection between design research and design education.   Contemporary society grows increasingly hyper-complex and globally competitive. This state of affairs raises fundamental questions for both Design Education and Design Research: Should research skills be integrated into undergraduate courses? How can we modify design courses without compromising the positive aspects of the educational studio experience? Can the three cycles of higher education in design be combined into a creative and inquisitive educational continuum?  To examine the relationship between research and education in Design we must address the topic of knowledge, keeping in mind that the development and dissemination of new and useful knowledge is the core purpose of a University. If we agree that design has its own things to know and ways to find out about them, then design knowledge resides in people, processes, products, and philosophy. This book explores the intersection of these four areas with the aim of uncovering insights to advance the current state of the design discipline.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It's never been a better time to be a writer for video games. You're tapping into an industry that was worth more than $120 billion dollars in 2019, and it's still growing.  And it's an industry that needs great storytellers.  But there's a BIG difference between a great story and a great game story. Traditional stories are told. Game stories are experienced. That's why video game narratives need a totally different design approach.  So how do you apply your scriptwriting, storylining, poetic, copywriting, prose producing skills to an audience that won't sit still and an industry that's ever changing?  That's what this book is about!  I've been a narrative designer for over a decade, as well as a novelist and a scriptwriter \/ storyliner for TV and comics. I love playing games, and even more, I love helping game developers realize their storytelling aspirations. Nothing delights me more than a game that's both fun to play and delivers a satisfying story experience.

In CML cancer, stem cells of bone marrow form abnormal WBCs that hinder the function of normal RBCs and WBCs. CML occurs due to a chromosomal translocation between BCR gene on Chromosome-22 and ABL gene on Chromosome-9. The purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway consists of three enzymes (hIMPDH, hGMPS and hGMPR) which are identified to be responsible for CML cancer and they are also involved in cellular metabolic pathways that exhibit elevated levels of activity in rapidly proliferating cells, such as neoplastic and regenerating tissues. These CML responsive proteins exist as type-I and II isoforms. Isoform-II is responsible for CML cancer, whereas isoform-I which keeps a housekeeping role, and observed in normal cells. Our in-silico methods may explore some new biochemical mechanism and novel conformation of this protein that may be effective for future drug discovery. The basic problem for discovery of drugs for CML cancer protein is that all proposed inhibitors bind to CML cancerous and normal protein, as a result both normal and cancer cells lose their function and die. To design the drugs for CML cancerous protein, isoform specific (type-II) drug design techniques were employed in this study and the new inhibitors were identified by computational method using different databases. The computationally designed proposed drugs can be effective to recognize the CML cancer protein and may act as a good drug candidate for CML cancer.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The analysis of time-series images is one of the most widely appearing problems in science, engineering, and business. In recent years this problem has gained importance due to the increasing availability of more sensitive sensors in science and engineering and due to the wide-spread use of computers in corporations which have increased the amount of time-series data collected by many magnitudes. An important feature of this book is the exploration of different approaches to handle and identify time dependent biomedical images. Biomedical imaging analysis and processing techniques deal with the interaction between all forms of radiation and biological molecules, cells or tissues, to visualize small particles and opaque objects, and to achieve the recognition of biomedical patterns. These are topics of great importance to biomedical science, biology, and medicine. Biomedical imaging analysis techniques can be applied in many different areas to solve existing problems. The various requirements arising from the process of resolving practical problems motivate and expedite the development of biomedical imaging analysis. This is a major reason for the fast growth of the discipline.\r\n                    \r\n"}

These phenomena occur in a variety of dynamical sys- tems far from equilibrium. In many practically very important physical sys- tems some fascinating patterns are always displayed at the interface between solid and liquid or between two liquids. Two prototypes of these phenomena are dendrite growth in solidification and viscous fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell. These two phenomena occur in completely different scientific fields, but both are described by similar nonlinear free boundary problems of partial- differential-equation systems; the boundary conditions on the interface for both cases contain a curvature operator involving the surface tension, which is nonlinear. Moreover, both cases raise the same challenging theoretical is- sues, interfacial instability mechanisms and pattern selection, and it is now found that these issues can be solved by the same analytical approach. Thus, these two phenomena are regarded as special examples of a class of nonlinear pattern formation phenomena in nature, and they are the prominent topics of the new interdisciplinary field of nonlinear science. This research monograph is based on a series of lectures I have given at McGill University, Canada (1993-1994), Northwestern Poly technical In- stitute, China (1994), Aachen University, Germany (1994), and the CRM summer school at Banff, Alberta, Canada (1995).\r\n                    \r\n"}

The authors develop a computer-aided procedure, to synthesize PID controllers that satisfy multiple design specifications. A geometric approach, which can be used to determine such designs methodically using 2- and 3-D computer graphics is the result.The text expands on the computation of the complete stabilizing set previously developed by the authors and presented here. This set is then systematically exploited to achieve multiple design specifications simultaneously. These specifications include classical gain and phase margins, time-delay tolerance, settling time and H-infinity norm bounds. The results are developed for continuous- and discrete-time systems. An extension to multivariable systems is also included.Analytical Design of PID Controllers provides a novel method of designing PID controllers, which makes it ideal for both researchers and professionals working in traditional industries as well as those connected with unmanned aerial vehicles, driverless cars and autonomous robots. \r\n\r\n"}

Truly interdisciplinary teams also need an appropriate common language, which was developed in the companion book Worth-Focused Design, Book 1: Balance, Integration, and Generosity (Cockton, 2020a). Its new lexicon for design progressions enables a framework for design and evaluation that works well with a worth focus. Design now has different meanings based upon the approach of different disciplinary practices. For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others, it is fitting things to people (beneficiaries). While each of these design foci has merits, there are risks in not having an appropriate balance across professions that claim the centre of design for their discipline and marginalise others. Generosity is key to the best creative design-delivering unexpected worth beyond documented needs, wants, or pain points. Truly interdisciplinary design must also balance and integrate approaches across several communities of practice, which is made easier by common ground. Worth provides a productive focus for this common ground and is symbiotic with balanced, integrated, and generous (BIG) practices. Practices associated with balance and integration for worth-focused generosity are illustrated in several case studies that have used approaches in this book, complementing them with additional practices.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Truly interdisciplinary teams also need an appropriate common language, which was developed in the companion book Worth-Focused Design, Book 1: Balance, Integration, and Generosity. Its new lexicon for design progressions enables a framework for design and evaluation that works well with a worth focus. Design now has different meanings based upon the approach of different disciplinary practices. For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others, it is fitting things to people. While each of these design foci has merits, there are risks in not having an appropriate balance across professions that claim the centre of design for their discipline and marginalise others. Generosity is key to the best creative design--delivering unexpected worth beyond documented needs, wants, or pain points. Truly interdisciplinary design must also balance and integrate approaches across several communities of practice, which is made easier by common ground. Worth provides a productive focus for this common ground and is symbiotic with balanced, integrated, and generous (BIG) practices. Practices associated with balance and integration for worth-focused generosity are illustrated in several case studies that have used approaches in this book, complemented them with additional practices.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Such an ambitious challenge can only be achieved through a holistic approach, capable of tackling the problem from a multidisciplinary point of view. One of the core technologies called to play a critical role in this approach is the use of energy storage systems. These systems enable, among other things, the balancing of the stochastic behavior of Renewable Sources and Distributed Generation in modern Energy Systems; the efficient supply of industrial and consumer loads; the development of efficient and clean transport; and the development of Nearly-Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) and intelligent cities. Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) consist of two (or more) storage devices with complementary key characteristics, that are able to behave jointly with better performance than any of the technologies considered individually. Recent developments in storage device technologies, interface systems, control and monitoring techniques, or visualization and information technologies have driven the implementation of HESS in many industrial, commercial and domestic applications. This Special Issue focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of hybrid energy storage systems across a broad spectrum, encompassing different storage technologies (including electrochemical, capacitive, mechanical or mechanical storage devices), engineering branches (power electronics and control strategies; energy engineering; energy engineering; chemistry; modelling, simulation and emulation techniques; data analysis and algorithms; social and economic analysis; intelligent and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems; and so on.), applications (energy systems, renewable energy generation, industrial applications, transportation, Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and critical load supply, etc.) and evaluation and performance (size and weight benefits, efficiency and power loss, economic analysis, environmental costs, etc.).\r\n                    \r\n"}

It is ideal to find the best design (section dimension, material type, and amount of reinforcement) with the minimum cost providing the design constraints (design formulation considering loading of structure). Metaheuristic methods inspired by natural phenomena can consider design constraints by combining the analyses of formulation of reinforced concrete structures with an iterative numerical algorithm using several convergence options of random generation of candidate design solutions. Metaheuristic Approaches for Optimum Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures: Emerging Research and Opportunities is a pivotal reference source that focuses on several metaheuristic algorithms and the design of several types of structural members. Additionally, retrofit applications and seismic design issues are considered for readers in earthquake zones.

However, to reduce the electric field magnitude on an insulator string with an optimum design is a challenging task. An optimization methods; Gravitational Search Algorithm and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm were proposed in this work. An insulator string model geometry with a corona ring was modeled in a finite element analysis software. The electric field distribution was evaluated using variation of corona ring dimensions, i.e. the ring diameter, the ring tube diameter and the vertical position of the ring along the insulator string. The insulator string with a corona ring design shows the minimum electric field magnitude using optimization techniques. Hence, this indicates the capability of the proposed methods in achieving an optimum design of a corona ring on an insulator string.\r\n                    \r\n"}

To design a BB converter with suitable voltage control, DC-DC boost and buck converters are cascaded such that it accomplishes the purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and soft starting of the BLDC motor. The BB converter exhibits the advantages of both the boost and buck converters and interestingly emerges as a solution to problems associated with these converters in SPV applications. The good switch utilization, high efficiency, non-inverting output voltage and low stress on power devices are the features of BB converter. This paper deals with the starting, dynamic and steady state performances under varying atmospheric conditions and examines the effectiveness of the BLDC motor with the proposed BB converter for SPV based water pumping. Simulated results using MATLAB\/Simulink followed by the experimental validation have demonstrated the suitability of this drive for SPV based water pumping system\r\n                    \r\n"}

A natural conclusion is that designing airplanes is not very interesting and does not require much creativity. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Around the world, engineers and scientists and academics - and inventors in their garages - are creating airplanes that implement bold new concepts that will shape the airplanes of the future.A book for kids of all ages, showing the latest, most creative, and most innovative ideas in the field of airplane design. These concepts are currently being tested and figured out. If the reader becomes an engineer in 10 or 20 years, they will use these new ideas - and their creativity! - to make the airplanes of the future better than those of today.The goal of the book is to get kids interested in an area of STEM that is growing very quickly: Every year, new designs are unveiled for drones, reusable spacecraft, \"flying cars\", electric or solar aircraft, futuristic airliners, and airplanes that can fly at extreme speeds and altitudes - or that can hover, and take off and land straight up and down like a helicopter.Younger kids will enjoy the pictures while having the text read to them. Older kids can use the book as a springboard for research into the many other innovative aircraft mentioned along the ones shown in the photos, to learn some of the fundamentals of aeronautical engineering.The book was written by a Boeing airplane designer who consulted with many people involved in unusual and innovative aircraft: The experts developing a Mach 5 airliner that can fly at the edge of space, the engineers who designed the world's most fuel-efficient helicopter (which can fly for 24 hours nonstop), the leaders of the organization that created one of the fastest jets in history, NASA researchers who work on the next generation of electric airplanes, flight instructors whose airplanes are the first to include amazing new safety features, and inventors who build futuristic airplanes in their garages and then fly them!The book illustrates these concepts by showing and explaining patents by Boeing and Airbus, futuristic concepts by NASA and Lockheed, record-breaking airplanes by Scaled Composites, research projects at universities, and photos of the latest experimental proof-of-concept airplanes doing things that no other airplane had ever done before!\r\n                    \r\n"}

Calls like these have arisen from an emerging awareness in HCI of findings from the social sciences that are relevant to the way people use and design technology. However, emerging work on bringing together gender research with software design choices is fragmented across multiple disciplines. This monograph aims to help bring such works together, by synthesizing the current state of affairs and future possibilities on how gender comes together with HCI design. The authors of this monograph consider inclusive design of technology whatever the gender of its users of particular importance. This conceptual review provides an overview of the motivations that have driven research in gender and inclusive HCI design. The authors review the empirical evidence for the impact of gender in thinking and behavior which underlies HCI research and design. They present how HCI design might inadvertently embed and perpetuate gender stereotypes. They also present current HCI design approaches to tackle gender stereotypes and produce gender-inclusive designs. The monograph concludes by discussing possible future directions in this area.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Biological networks are an effective model for providing insights about biological mechanisms. Networks with different characteristics are employed for representing different scenarios. This powerful model allows analysts to perform many kinds of analyses which can be mined to provide interesting information about underlying biological behaviors.The text also covers techniques for discovering exceptional patterns, such as a pattern accounting for local similarities and also collaborative effects involving interactions between multiple actors (for example genes). Among these exceptional patterns, of particular interest are discriminative patterns, namely those which are able to discriminate between two input populations (for example healthy\/unhealthy samples). In addition, the work includes a discussion on the most recent proposal on discovering discriminative patterns, in which there is a labeled network for each sample, resulting in a database of networks representing a sample set. This enables the analyst to achieve a much finer analysis than with traditional techniques, which are only able to consider an aggregated network of each population.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It is simple. It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all. Our digital era brings progressive ideas and paradigm shifts - but they are only truly progressive if everybody can participate.In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, multiple crucial aspects of technological accessibility are confronted, followed by step-by-step solutions from User Experience Design professor and author Regine Gilbert. Think about every potential user who could be using your product. Could they be visually impaired? Have limited motor skills? Be deaf or hard of hearing? This book addresses a plethora of web accessibility issues that people with disabilities face. Your app might be blocking out an entire sector of the population without you ever intending or realizing it. For example, is your instructional text full of animated words and Emoji icons? This makes it difficult for a user with vision impairment to use an assistive reading device, such as a speech synthesizer, along with your app correctly. In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, Gilbert covers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements, emerging technologies such as VR and AR, best practices for web development, and more.As a creator in the modern digital era, your aim should be to make products that are inclusive of all people. Technology has, overall, increased connection and information equality around the world. To continue its impact, access and usability of such technology must be made a priority, and there is no better place to get started than Inclusive Design for a Digital World.What You'll LearnThe moral, ethical, and high level legal reasons for accessible designTools and best practices for user research and web developersThe different types of designs for disabilities on various platformsFamiliarize yourself with web compliance guidelinesTest products and usability best practicesUnderstand past innovations and future opportunities for continued improvementWho This Book Is ForPractitioners of product design, product development, content, and design can benefit from this book.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Design theory is the scientific foundation for database design, just as the relational model is the scientific foundation for database technology in general. Databases lie at the heart of so much of what we do in the computing world that negative impacts of poor design can be extraordinarily widespread. This second edition includes greatly expanded coverage of exotic and little understood normal forms such as: essential tuple normal form (ETNF), redundancy free normal form (RFNF), superkey normal form (SKNF), sixth normal form (6NF), and domain key normal form (DKNF). Also included are new appendixes, including one that provides an in-depth look into the crucial notion of data consistency. Sequencing of topics has been improved, and many explanations and examples have been rewritten and clarified based upon the author's teaching of the content in instructor-led courses. This book aims to be different from other books on design by bridging the gap between the theory of design and the practice of design. The book explains theory in a way that practitioners should be able to understand, and it explains why that theory is of considerable practical importance. Reading this book provides you with an important theoretical grounding on which to do the practical work of database design. Reading the book also helps you in going to and understanding the more academic texts as you build your base of knowledge and expertise. Anyone with a professional interest in database design can benefit from using this book as a stepping-stone toward a more rigorous design approach and more lasting database models.What You Will LearnUnderstand what design theory is and is notBe aware of the two different goals of normalizationKnow which normal forms are truly significant Apply design theory in practice Be familiar with techniques for dealing with redundancy Understand what consistency is and why it is crucially important  Who This Book Is ForThose having a professional interest in database design, including data and database administrators; educators and students specializing in database matters; information modelers and database designers; DBMS designers, implementers, and other database vendor personnel; and database consultants.

But translating those patterns into Python isn't always straightforward.With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity--and get the most value out of their test suites.Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal\/clean architecture)Domain-driven design's distinction between entities, value objects, and aggregatesRepository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storageEvents, commands, and the message busCommand-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices\r\n                    \r\n"}

Games have been developed for teaching, recruiting and to collect data to improve search engines. This book examines the fundamentals of designing any game with a serious purpose and provides a way of thinking on how to design one successfully. The reader will be introduced to a design philosophy called \"Triadic Game Design.\"; a theory that all games involve three worlds: the worlds of Reality, Meaning, and Play. Each world is affiliated with aspects. A balance needs to be found within and between the three worlds. Such a balance is difficult to achieve, during the design many tensions will arise, forcing designers to make trade-offs. To deal with these tensions and to ensure that the right decisions are made to create a harmonic game, a frame of reference is needed. This is what Triadic Game Design offers.\r\n                    \r\n"}

A natural conclusion is that designing airplanes is not very interesting and does not require much creativity. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Around the world, engineers and scientists and academics - and inventors in their garages - are creating airplanes that implement bold new concepts that will shape the airplanes of the future. A book for kids of all ages, showing the latest, most creative, and most innovative ideas in the field of airplane design. The book is full of large, exciting pictures of exotic, unusual, and futuristic airplanes. The innovative technologies in each airplane is explained in simple language. The concepts shown in this book are currently being tested and figured out. If the reader becomes an engineer in 10 or 20 years, they will use these new ideas - and their creativity! - to make the airplanes of the future better than those of today. The goal of the book is to get kids interested in an area of STEM that is growing very quickly: Every year, new designs are unveiled for drones, reusable spacecraft, \"flying cars\", electric or solar aircraft, futuristic airliners, and airplanes that can fly at extreme speeds and altitudes - or that can hover, and take off and land straight up and down like a helicopter. Younger kids will enjoy the pictures while having the text read to them. Older kids can use the book as a springboard for research into the many other innovative aircraft mentioned along the ones shown in the photos, to learn some of the fundamentals of aeronautical engineering. The book was written by a Boeing airplane designer who consulted with many people involved in unusual and innovative aircraft: The experts developing a Mach 5 airliner that can fly at the edge of space, the engineers who designed the world's most fuel-efficient helicopter (which can fly for 24 hours nonstop), the leaders of the organization that created one of the fastest jets in history, NASA researchers who work on the next generation of electric airplanes, flight instructors whose airplanes are the first to include amazing new safety features, and inventors who build futuristic airplanes in their garages and then fly them! The book illustrates these concepts by showing and explaining patents by Boeing and Airbus, futuristic concepts by NASA and Lockheed, record-breaking airplanes by Scaled Composites, research projects at universities, and photos of the latest experimental proof-of-concept airplanes doing things that no other airplane had ever done before!\r\n                    \r\n"}

An active suspension system is considered to be better than the passive suspension system. In this thesis, 2 degrees of freedom of a linear quarter car active suspension system is designed, which is subject to different disturbances on the road. Since the parametric uncertainty in the spring, the shock absorber, mass and the actuator has been considered, robust control is used. In this thesis, H∞ and 繕- synthesis controllers are used to improve the driving comfort and the ability to drive the car on the road. For the analysis of the time domain, using a MATLAB script program and performed a test using four disturbance inputs of the road (bump, random, sinusoidal and harmonic) for the suspension deflection, the acceleration of the body and the body travel for the active suspension with the H∞ controller and active suspension with 繕- synthesis controller and the comparative simulation and reference results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented active suspension system with 繕- synthesis controller. In addition, in this thesis, comparison have been made between the active suspension system with 繕-synthesis controller and 5 different robust controller for suspension deflection, body acceleration and body travel tests using bump, random, sinusoidal pavements and harmonic road disturbances. Body accelerations comparison of the active suspension system with 繕-synthesis controller with VW (Volkswagen) Passat B5 passenger car is done for a bump road input disturbance and the result shows that there is a 50% reduction in body acceleration for the active suspension system with 繕- synthesis controller.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It also proposes both AC-DC and DC-DC types of converters for different electrical loads to improve the performance these systems. To increase fuel efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, less efficient non-electrical aircraft systems are being replaced by electrical systems. However, more electrical systems requires more electrical power to be generated in the aircraft. The increased consumption of electrical power in both civil and military aircrafts has necessitated the use of more efficient electrical power conversion technologies. This book presents acomprehensive mathematical analysis and the design and digital simulation of the power converters. Subsequently it discusses the construction of the hardware prototypes of each converter and the experimental tests carried out to verify the benefits of the proposed solutions in comparison to the existing solutions.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In this book you will see how these all come together in one of the most efficient ways to develop complex software, with a particular focus on the DDD process. Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java starts by building out the Cargo Tracker reference application as a monolithic application using the Jakarta EE platform. By doing so, you will map concepts of DDD (bounded contexts, language, and aggregates) to the corresponding available tools (CDI, JAX-RS, and JPA) within the Jakarta EE platform. Once you have completed the monolithic application, you will walk through the complete conversion of the monolith to a microservices-based architecture, again mapping the concepts of DDD and the corresponding available tools within the MicroProfile platform (config, discovery, and fault tolerance). To finish this section, you will examine the same microservices architecture on the Spring Boot platform. The final set of chapters looks at what the application would be like if you used the CQRS and event sourcing patterns. Here you'll use the Axon framework as the base framework. What You Will LearnDiscover the DDD architectural principles and use the DDD design patternsUse the new Eclipse Jakarta EE platform Work with the Spring Boot frameworkImplement microservices design patterns, including context mapping, logic design, entities, integration, testing, and securityCarry out event sourcingApply CQRS Who This Book Is ForJunior developers intending to start working on enterprise Java; senior developers transitioning from monolithic- to microservices-based architectures; and architects transitioning to a DDD philosophy of building applications.\r\n\r\n"}

This corresponds to the simplest physical model of the kinetics governing the underlying degradation, but this simple model does not always hold. We need to understand what more complex physical models may look like. Design & Analysis of Accelerated Tests for Mission Critical Reliability presents innovative theory and methods for recognizing and handling the more complicated, cases often encountered in practice. The theory integrates a physical understanding of underlying phenomena and the statistical modeling of observation noise to provide a single theoretical framework for accelerated testing. The treatment includes general approaches that can be used with various computational software packages and an explicit computing environment in S-PLUS. Source code written by the authors is included and available for download from http: \/\/www.crcpress.com\/e_products\/downloads. For practitioners, this book provides immediately useable tools. For researchers, it presents intriguing open questions. And for the academic community, numerous worked examples, end-of-chapter exercises, and a format that relegates technical and theoretical details to chapter appendices make this an outstanding supplementary textbook for senior and graduate-level students.\r\n                    \r\n"}

With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.\r\n\r\n"}

It treats the subject in a unified manner, providing numerical methods and design examples. The specific focus is on continuum design sensitivity analysis, which offers significant advantages over discrete design sensitivity methods. Continuum design sensitivity formulas are derived from the material derivative in continuum mechanics and the variational form of the governing equation. Continuum sensitivity analysis is applied to Maxwell equations of electrostatic, magnetostatic and eddy-current systems, and then the sensitivity formulas for each system are derived in a closed form; an integration along the design interface.The book also introduces the recent breakthrough of the topology optimization method, which is accomplished by coupling the level set method and continuum design sensitivity. This topology optimization method enhances the possibility of the global minimum with minimised computational time, and in addition the evolving shapes during the iterative design process are easily captured in the level set equation. Moreover, since the optimization algorithm is transformed into a well-known transient analysis algorithm for differential equations, its numerical implementation becomes very simple and convenient. Despite the complex derivation processes and mathematical expressions, the obtained sensitivity formulas are very straightforward for numerical implementation. This book provides detailed explanation of the background theory and the derivation process, which will help readers understand the design method and will set the foundation for advanced research in the future.\r\n\r\n"}

Formal Verification of Floating-Point Hardware Design advances a verification methodology based on a unified theory of register-transfer logic and floating-point arithmetic that has been developed and applied to the formal verification of commercial floating-point units over the course of more than two decades, during which the author was employed by several major microprocessor design companies.  The book consists of five parts, the first two of which present a rigorous exposition of the general theory based on the first principles of arithmetic. Part I covers bit vectors and the bit manipulation primitives, integer and fixed-point encodings, and bit-wise logical operations. Part II addresses the properties of floating-point numbers, the formats in which they are encoded as bit vectors, and the various modes of floating-point rounding. In Part III, the theory is extended to the analysis of several algorithms and optimization techniques that are commonly used in commercial implementations of elementary arithmetic operations. As a basis for the formal verification of such implementations, Part IV contains high-level specifications of correctness of the basic arithmetic instructions of several major industry-standard floating-point architectures, including all details pertaining to the handling of exceptional conditions. Part V illustrates the methodology, applying the preceding theory to the comprehensive verification of a state-of-the-art commercial floating-point unit. All of these results have been formalized in the logic of the ACL2 theorem prover and mechanically checked to ensure their correctness. They are presented here, however, in simple conventional mathematical notation. The book presupposes no familiarity with ACL2, logic design, or any mathematics beyond basic high school algebra. It will be of interest to verification engineers as well as arithmetic circuit designers who appreciate the value of a rigorous approach to their art, and is suitable as a graduate text in computer arithmetic.  \r\n\r\n"}

First, it discusses how the classical population-game approach can contribute to and complement the design of optimization-based controllers. It shows how the features of this approach can be exploited to extend their capabilities in the solution of distributed optimization problems, and examines density games in order to consider multiple coupled constraints and preserve the non-centralized information requirements. Furthermore, it establishes a close relationship between the possible interactions among agents in a population with constrained information sharing among different local controllers. It also discusses coalitional games, focusing on the Shapley power index and proposes an alternative method of computing the latter, which reduces computational time, as well as a different way of finding it using distributed communication structures. All the proposed strategies are then tested on various control problems, such as those related to the Barcelona water supply network, multiple continuous stirred tank reactors, various unmanned aerial vehicle systems, and a water distribution system. This thesis, examined at the Universitat Polit癡cnica de Catalunya and Universidad de los Andes in 2017, received the award for best thesis in control from the control group of the Spanish Committee of Automatic Control (CEA) in the same year.\r\n\r\n"}

The work described has opened up a rich and largely unexplored area for platinum-based drug design, and ultimately paves the way for superior immuno-chemotherapeutics with better clinical outcome for patients. Historically, the contribution of the immune system to chemotherapy outcomes has been neglected, as anticancer drugs were believed to be immunosuppressive. However, this has been challenged by contemporary evidence suggesting that many chemotherapeutics, including platinum-based agents, stimulate the innate and\/or adaptive immune system and that these \"secret allies\" contribute tangibly to clinical outcomes. A multi-pronged immuno-chemotherapeutic approach not only shrinks tumors, but more importantly, reactivate dormant immune responses to malignancies, eliminating residual cancer cells.\r\n\r\n"}

This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product. Mindful Design introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human's day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain's propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively. In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience. Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices. What You'll Learn Review how attention and distraction work and the cost of attentional switchingUse Gestalt principles to communicate visual groupingEnsure your underlying models make sense to your audienceUse time, progression, and transition to create a compositionCarefully examine controlling behavior through reductionist and behaviorist motivation concepts Apply the theoretical knowledge to practical, mindful application design Who This Book Is For The primary audience for this book is professional designers who wish to learn more about the human mind and how to apply that to their work. The book is also useful for design-focussed product owners and startup founders who wish to apply ethical thinking to a team, or when bootstrapping their products. The secondary audience is design students who are either studying a 'traditional' visual design course, or a UX\/interaction design course who have a desire to learn how they might be able to apply mindful design to their early careers. Finally, a tertiary audience for this book would be tutors involved in teaching design, or peripheral, courses who may wish to incorporate its teachings into their lectures, workshops or seminars.\r\n\r\n"}

It unites game and decision theory with network science to lay a system-theoretical foundation for understanding the resiliency of interdependent and heterogeneous network systems. The authors pay particular attention to critical infrastructure systems, such as electric power, water, transportation, and communications. They discuss how infrastructure networks are becoming increasingly interconnected as the integration of Internet of Things devices, and how a single-point failure in one network can propagate to other infrastructures, creating an enormous social and economic impact. The specific topics in the book include:  - static and dynamic meta-network resilience game analysis and design; - optimal control of interdependent epidemics spreading over complex networks; and - applications to secure and resilient design of critical infrastructures. These topics are supported by up-to-date summaries of the authors' recent research findings. The authors then discuss the future challenges and directions in the analysis and design of interdependent networks and explain the role of multi-disciplinary research has in computer science, engineering, public policy, and social sciences fields of study. The brief introduces new application areas in mathematics, economics, and system and control theory, and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners looking for new approaches to assess and mitigate risks in their systems and enhance their network resilience. A Game- and Decision-Theoretic Approach to Resilient Interdependent Network Analysis and Design also has self-contained chapters, which allows for multiple levels of reading by anyone with an interest in game and decision theory and network science.\r\n\r\n"}

It contains a unified overview of a broad range of general designs, including the most recent results and their proofs, such as the homogeneous and nonlinear Luenberger design techniques. The book starts from the observation that most observer designs consist in looking for a reversible change of coordinates transforming the expression of the system dynamics into some specific structures, called normal forms, for which an observer is known. Therefore, the problem of observer design is broken down into three sub-problems: -What are the available normal forms and their associated observers?-Under which conditions can a system be transformed into one of these forms and through which transformation? -How can an inverse transformation that recovers an estimate in the given initial coordinates be achieved? This organisation allows the book to structure results within a united framework, highlighting the importance of the choice of the observer coordinates for nonlinear systems. In particular, the first part covers state-affine forms with their Luenberger or Kalman designs, and triangular forms with their homogeneous high-gain designs. The second part addresses the transformation into linear forms through linearization by output injection or in the context of a nonlinear Luenberger design, and into triangular forms under the well-known uniform and differential observability assumptions. Finally, the third part presents some recently developed methods for avoiding the numerically challenging inversion of the transformation. Observer Design for Nonlinear Systems addresses students and researchers looking for an introduction to or an overview of the state of the art in observer design for nonlinear continuous-time dynamical systems. The book gathers the most important results focusing on a large and diffuse literature on general observer designs with global convergence, and is a valuable source of information for academics and practitioners.\r\n\r\n"}

It is also appropriate for students preparing a capstone project where they need to understand, model, supply, control and specify the grid side power converters. The main goal of the book is developing in students the skills that are required to design, control and use static power converters that serve as an interface between the ac grid and renewable power sources. The same skills can be used to design, control and use the static power converters used within the micro-grids and nano-grids, as the converters that provide the interface between such grids and the external grid. The author's approach starts with basic functionality and the role of grid connected power converters in their typical applications, and their static and dynamic characteristics. Particular effort is dedicated to developing simple, concise, intuitive and easy-to-use mathematical models that summarize the essence of the grid side converter dynamics. Mathematics is reduced to a necessary minimum, solved examples are used extensively to introduce new concepts, and exercises are used to test mastery of new skills. \r\n\r\n"}

Java Program Design presents program design principles to help practicing programmers up their game and remain relevant in the face of changing trends and an evolving language. The book enhances the traditional design patterns with Java's new functional programming features, such as functional interfaces and lambda expressions. The result is a fresh treatment of design patterns that expands their power and applicability, and reflects current best practice. The book examines some well-designed classes from the Java class library, using them to illustrate the various object-oriented principles and patterns under discussion. Not only does this approach provide good, practical examples, but you will learn useful library classes you might not otherwise know about.The design of a simplified banking program is introduced in chapter 1 in a non-object-oriented incarnation and the example is carried through all chapters. You can see the object orientation develop as various design principles are progressively applied throughout the book to produce a refined, fully object-oriented version of the program in the final chapter. What You'll LearnCreate well-designed programs, and identify and improve poorly-designed onesBuild a professional-level understanding of polymorphism and its use in Java interfaces and class hierarchiesApply classic design patterns to Java programming problems while respecting the modern features of the Java languageTake advantage of classes from the Java library to facilitate the implementation of design patterns in your programsWho This Book Is ForJava programmers who are comfortable writing non-object-oriented code and want a guided immersion into the world of object-oriented Java, and intermediate programmers interested in strengthening their foundational knowledge and taking their object-oriented skills to the next level. Even advanced programmers will discover interesting examples and insights in each chapter.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Many market studies indicate not only a tremendous market potential of MEMS devices; year by year we see the actual market grow as the technology matures. In fact, these days, many large silicon foundries have a MEMS group exploring this promising technology, including such giants as INTEL and Motorola. Yet MEMS are fundamentally different from microelectronics. This means that companies with an established track record in these branches need to adapt their skills, whereas companies that want to enter the \"miniaturization\" market need to establish an entirely new set of capabil- ities. The same can be said of engineers with classical training, who will also need to be educated toward their future professional activity in the MEMS field. Here are some questions that a company or technologist may ask: I have an existing product with miniaturization market poten- tial. Which technology should I adopt? What are the manufacturing options available for miniaturiza- tion? What are the qualitative differences? How do we maintainamarketleadforproductsbased onMEMS? Is there CAD support?Can we outsource manufacturing? Which skills in our current capability need only adaptation? What skills need to be added?

This increase in mobile traffic has made mobile user experience one of the most important factors in the success of a product or website. Providing great user experience is essential from the first second. More than 60% of users will not return to a mobile site that they had trouble accessing, and this means that content, navigation and visual design elements must be twice as intuitive as they are on a desktop. In the face of these trends, designers must constantly keep in mind the point that little screens have very little room for error. Interactive Design for Screen is the result of extensive research centred on the latest designs optimized for the screens of mobile devices. Over a hundred projects appear in this volume, and they showcase the functionality and accessibility of great mobile user interfaces. The designers featured analyse their projects from a variety of perspectives such as product specifications, site purpose and target users, making Interactive Design for Screen a highly practical and inspiring guide for students and designers who know that a great mobile user experience is nothing less than essential. It includes QR codes in each project that link to the behance page to let readers see the interactive effect of the project.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Helping you understand the issues involved in designing and constructing embedded systems, Design of Low-Power Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures offers new frameworks for optimizing the architecture of components in embedded systems in order to decrease area and save power. Real application benchmarks and gate-level simulations substantiate these frameworks.The first half of the book explains how to reduce power in the configuration cache. The authors present a low-power reconfiguration technique based on reusable context pipelining that merges the concept of context reuse into context pipelining. They also propose dynamic context compression capable of supporting required bits of the context words set to enable and the redundant bits set to disable. In addition, they discuss dynamic context management for reducing power consumption in the configuration cache by controlling a read\/write operation of the redundant context words.Focusing on the design of a cost-effective processing element array to reduce area and power consumption, the second half of the text presents a cost-effective array fabric that uniquely rearranges processing elements and their interconnection designs. The book also describes hierarchical reconfigurable computing arrays consisting of two reconfigurable computing blocks with two types of communication structure. The two computing blocks share critical resources, offering an efficient communication interface between them and reducing the overall area. The final chapter takes an integrated approach to optimization that draws on the design schemes presented in earlier chapters. Using a case study, the authors demonstrate the synergy effect of combining multiple design schemes.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It proposes an effective optimisation method for determining the basic characteristics of the non-linear visco-elastic elements used in passive vibration reduction systems. In the case of semi-active and active vibration isolators, a design process of the advanced control systems is proposed that makes possible to optimise the controller settings relatively to the selected vibro-isolation criteria. The approach developed here is subsequently tested by means of experimental investigations conducted on various sample vibration reduction systems: passive, semi-active and active. The book presents a biomechanical modelling approach that allows users to select the properties of vibro-isolation systems for different types of oscillation and different optimisation criteria - and can significantly reduce the harmful vibrations that can affect the human body in the process. Further, the book equips readers to evaluate the viscoelastic characteristics of passive systems and design control systems for semi-active and active systems.

The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. The content applies to industries such as military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, space exploration, etc.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In order to improve the electrical conductance, the π orbital of the molecule is directly bonded to the metal orbital, because anchoring groups, which were typically used in other studies to bind molecule with metal electrodes, became resistive spacers. Using this direct π-binding, the author has successfully demonstrated highly conductive SMJs involving benzene, endohedral metallofullerene Ce@C82, and nitrogen. Subsequently, the author investigated control of the electrical conductance of SMJs using pyrazine. The nitrogen atom in the π-conjugated system of pyrazine was expected to function as an anchoring point, and two bonding states were expected. One originates primarily from the π orbital, while the other originates primarily from an n state of the nitrogen. Measurements of conductance and dI\/dV spectra coupled with theoretical calculations revealed that the pyrazine SMJ has bistable conductance states, in which the pyrazine axis is either tilted or parallel with respect to the junction axis. The bistable states were switched by changing the gap size between the metal electrodes using an external force. Notably, it is difficult to change the electrical properties of bulk-state materials using mechanical force. The findings reveal that the electron transport properties of a SMJ can be controlled by designing a proper metal-molecule interface, which has considerable potential for molecular electronics. Moreover, this thesis will serve as a guideline for every step of SMJ research: design, fabrication, evaluation, and control.\r\n\r\n"}

In particular, it focuses on model driven engineering methods including architecture description languages, virtual prototyping, and formal analysis methods. CPS are based on a new design paradigm intended to enable emerging software-intensive systems. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with the help of feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The principal challenges in system design lie in this constant interaction of software, hardware and physics. Developing reliable CPS has become a critical issue for the industry and society, because many applications such as transportation, power distribution, medical equipment and tele-medicine are dependent on CPS. Safety and security requirements must be ensured by means of powerful validation tools. Satisfying such requirements, including quality of service, implies having formally proven the required properties of the system before it is deployed. The book is concerned with internationally standardized modeling languages such as AADL, SysML, and MARTE. As the effectiveness of the technologies is demonstrated with industrial sample cases from the automotive and aerospace sectors, links between the methods presented and industrial problems are clearly understandable. Each chapter is self-contained, addressing specific scientific or engineering problems, and identifying further issues. In closing, it includes perspectives on future directions in CPS design from an architecture analysis viewpoint.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It discusses the requirements for good experimentation, the completely randomized design, the use of orthogonal contrast to test hypotheses, and the model adequacy check. With an emphasis on two-factor factorial experiments, the author analyzes repeated measures as well as fixed, random, and mixed effects models. He also describes designs with randomization restrictions, before delving into the special cases of the 2k and 3k factorial designs, including fractional replication and confounding. In addition, the book covers response surfaces, balanced incomplete block and hierarchical designs, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and MANOVA.

In both models, three stakeholders are considered: the network manager\/designer, the adversary (intelligent attacker), and the network users. The frameworks of both models and some other possible models are presented in this dissertation. The first framework is a bi-objective designer model. The designer in this model has two objectives at the top level: to reduce the total system cost and to reduce the vulnerability of the network. The Sioux Falls network consists of 24 nodes and 76 links was chosen for to evaluate this framework. The decision of the designer and attacker was improving or destroying the links. Metaheuristic algorithm was used to solve the designer and attacker problems. For the user equilibrium problem, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm was implemented. The objective of the designer of the network in the first model, consist of two goals. The two goals may conflict on the amount of amount of limited available budget to be invested on the desired project\/links. Therefore, a trade off solutions between these two objectives may forms. The results proved that the proposed multi-level model is able to find the Pareto front solutions for the two objectives of the designer. The second framework is a three-level zero-sum game model. In this framework, the payoffs from the designer are assumed to have the same value to the adversary entity. Therefore, the goal of this framework is to minimize the maximum gain that the adversary can achieve. An example network with 6 nodes and 16 links was used to examine this framework. The results showed that the model could be a valuable tool to reduce the potential vulnerability of networks.

They are used by almost every sound reinforcement system, and by almost every recording studio monitoring set-up. There is also a big usage of active crossovers in car audio, with the emphasis on routing the bass to enormous low-frequency loudspeakers. Active crossovers are used to a small but rapidly growing extent in domestic hifi, and I argue that their widespread introduction may be the next big step in this field.  The Design of Active Crossovers has now been updated and extended for the Second Edition, taking in developments in loudspeaker technology and crossover design. Many more pre-designed filters are included so that crossover development can be faster and more certain, and the result will have a high performance. The Second Edition continues the tradition of the first in avoiding complicated algebra and complex numbers, with the mathematics reduced to the bare minimum; there is nothing more complicated to grapple with than a square root.  New features of the Second Edition include:   ● More on loudspeaker configurations and their crossover requirements:   MTM Mid-Tweeter-Mid configurations (The d'Appolito arrangement)  Line arrays (J arrays) for sound reinforcement  Frequency tapering  Band zoning  Power tapering  Constant-Beamwidth Transducer (CBT) loudspeaker arrays  ● More on specific sound-reinforcement issues like the loss of high frequencies due to the absorption of sound in air and how it varies.  ● Lowpass filters now have their own separate chapter.  Much more on third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-order lowpass filters.  Many more examples are given with component values ready-calculated  ● Highpass filters now have their own separate chapter, complementary to the chapter on lowpass filters.  Much more on third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-order highpass filters.  Many more examples are given with component values ready-calculated  ● A new chapter dealing with filters other than the famous Sallen & Key type. New filter types are introduced such as the third-order multiple feedback filter.  There is new information on controlling the Q and gain of state-variable filters.  ● More on the performance of crossover filters, covering noise, distortion, and the internal overload problems of filters.  ● The chapter on bandpass and notch filters is much extended, with in-depth coverage of the Bainter filter, which can produce beautifully deep notches without precision components or adjustment.  ● Much more information on the best ways to combine standard components to get very accurate non-standard values. Not only can you get a very accurate nominal value, but also the effective tolerance of the combination can be significantly better than that of the individual components used. There is no need to keep huge numbers of resistor and capacitor values in stock.  ● More on low-noise high-performance balanced line inputs for active crossovers, including versions that give extraordinarily high common-mode rejection. (noise rejection)  ● Two new appendices giving extensive lists of crossover patents, and crossover-based articles in journals.  This book is packed full of valuable information, with virtually every page revealing nuggets of specialized knowledge never before published. Essential points of theory bearing on practical performance are lucidly and thoroughly explained, with the mathematics kept to an essential minimum. Douglas' background in design for manufacture ensures he keeps a very close eye on the cost of things.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Pharmaceutical companies conduct stability studies to characterize the degradation of drug products and to estimate drug shelf life. Illustrating how stability studies play an important role in drug safety and quality assurance, Statistical Design and Analysis of Stability Studies presents the principles and methodologies in the design and analysis of stability studies.After introducing the basic concepts of stability testing, the book focuses on short-term stability studies and reviews several methods for estimating drug expiration dating periods. It then compares some commonly employed study designs and discusses both fixed and random batch statistical analyses. Following a chapter on the statistical methods for stability analysis under a linear mixed effects model, the book examines stability analyses with discrete responses, multiple components, and frozen drug products. In addition, the author provides statistical methods for dissolution testing and explores current issues and recent developments in stability studies.To ensure the safety of consumers, professionals in the field must carry out stability studies to determine the reliability of drug products during their expiration period. This book provides the material necessary for you to perform stability designs and analyses in pharmaceutical research and development.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Using extensive and informative illustrations, tables and photographs, it systematically presents real-life case studies and established findings regarding various forming processes and methods aided by FEM simulation, and addresses various issues related to metal formed part design, process determination, die design and die service life analysis and prolongation, as well as product quality assurance and improvement. Metal forming has been widely used in many industries. This traditional manufacturing process, however, has long been linked to many years of apprenticeship and skilled craftsmanship, and its conventional design and development paradigm appeared to involve more know-how and trial-and-error than in-depth scientific calculation, analysis and simulation. The design paradigm for forming processes and metal formed product development thus cannot meet the current demands for short development lead-times, low production costs and high product quality. With the advent of numerical simulation technologies, the design and development of forming processes and metal formed products are carried out with the aid of FEM simulation, allowing all the potential design spaces to be identified and evaluated, and the best design to ultimately be determined and implemented. Such a design and development paradigm aims at ensuring \"designing right the first time\" and reducing the need for trial-and-error in the workshop. This book provides postgraduates, manufacturing engineers and professionals in this field with an in-depth understanding of the design process and sufficient knowledge to support metal formed part design, forming process determination, tooling design, and product quality assurance and control via FEM simulation. \r\n\r\n"}

First, it discusses how the classical population-game approach can contribute to and complement the design of optimization-based controllers. It shows how the features of this approach can be exploited to extend their capabilities in the solution of distributed optimization problems, and examines density games in order to consider multiple coupled constraints and preserve the non-centralized information requirements. Furthermore, it establishes a close relationship between the possible interactions among agents in a population with constrained information sharing among different local controllers. It also discusses coalitional games, focusing on the Shapley power index and proposes an alternative method of computing the latter, which reduces computational time, as well as a different way of finding it using distributed communication structures. All the proposed strategies are then tested on various control problems, such as those related to the Barcelona water supply network, multiple continuous stirred tank reactors, various unmanned aerial vehicle systems, and a water distribution system. This thesis, examined at the Universitat Polit癡cnica de Catalunya and Universidad de los Andes in 2017, received the award for best thesis in control from the control group of the Spanish Committee of Automatic Control (CEA) in the same year.\r\n\r\n"}

This book is a first approach to establishing a comprehensive PA knowledge base.LP design, PA verification, and Unified Power Format (UPF) or IEEE-1801 power format standards are no longer special features. These technologies and methodologies are now part of industry-standard design, verification, and implementation flows (DVIF). Almost every chip design today incorporates some kind of low power technique either through power management on chip, by dividing the design into different voltage areas and controlling the voltages, through PA dynamic and PA static verification, or their combination.The entire LP design and PA verification process involves thousands of techniques, tools, and methodologies, employed from the register transfer level (RTL) of design abstraction down to the synthesis or place-and-route levels of physical design. These techniques, tools, and methodologies are evolving everyday through the progression of design-verification complexity and more intelligent ways of handling that complexity by engineers, researchers, and corporate engineering policy makers.  \r\n\r\n"}
{"書名":"U.S. Cruisers","書籍網站":"https:\/\/www.kingstone.com.tw\/\/basic\/203c004210907?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Design%20Pattern&pi=48","作者":"Norman,Friedman","出版社":"US Naval Institute Press","ISBN":9781682476260.0,"圖片網址":"https:\/\/cdn.kingstone.com.tw\/english\/images\/product\/6260\/9781682476260.jpg","書籍簡介":"\r\n\r\nLike other books in Norman Friedman's design-history series, this one pays attention to all designs, even those that never left the drawing board, since every proposal made is a link in the evolution of the cruiser force. Friedman, a recognized authority on U.S. warships, uncovers the reasoning behind the many radical changes in U.S. cruiser design, which culminated in the series of Aegis missile ships. He deals both with evolving technology and with those changes in the doctrine and role of the U.S. Navy that clearly affected cruiser design, Because the nature of the cruiser is somewhat ill defined, his book discusses a wide variety of ships, from the battleship-like armored cruisers of the turn of the century the battle cruisers of 1916 to scout cruisers and the Atlantas, ships that were, in many ways, enlarged destroyers. It covers the emergence of \"peace cruisers,\" which were essentially large gunboats, and the post-1945 command and missile cruisers. The World War II Alaska-class large cruisers are also included. Friedman shows how the path from the first steel cruisers to the ultramodern Ticonderogas defines many of the themes of U.S. naval development: the transition from a coastal defense\/commerce raiding navy to a navy designed to seize and exploit command of the world's oceans, and from a navy of independent cruisers on foreign stations to a battle fleet navy and then a carrier navy. Arms control is another important theme of this book. Friedman explains how cruiser design, much more that the design of any other category of ship, has been affected by the constraints of naval arms limitation treaties. He uses the Erie-class gunboat, a \"slow cruiser,\" and the original Cleveland, an abortive design that stayed within the 8,000-ton limit prescribed by the London Treaty of 1936, as examples of attempts to exploit treaty restrictions. Also carefully examined are the many post-World War II cruiser projects, both those that were built, like the nuclear powered Long Beach, and those that were not, like the specialized command ship of 1968. In every case, the author discusses not merely what was tried, but why it succeeded or failed. A.D. Baker III and Alan Raven have drawn detailed scale outboard and plan views of each cruiser class and of major modifications to many classes. The author has provided inboard profiles and sketches of abortive projects. Numerous photographs complement the text. Appendices include ship characteristics and data on ship careers. U.S. Cruisers is essential reading for those concerned with the future of the U.S. Navy. Naval historians and architects alike will find this the most comprehensive reference available on the subject.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Along with this desire, many different LEGO robotics competitions emerged as well. Among the most popular today is FIRST LEGO League (FLL). LEGO MINDSTORMS kits have changed considerably over the years, and the current MINDSTORMS NXT system offers an array of new functionality with improved sensors, motors, and programming abilities. For people who have been working with the MINDSTORMS system for many years, these changes have been welcome additions. However, for people new to the world of LEGO robots, things can get overwhelming very quickly. The goal of this book is to help coaches and team members better understand what it takes to build a winning robot for competitive LEGO robotics events. Some knowledge of the LEGO MINDSTORMS system would be helpful prior to using this book. The design principles covered in this book are intended not to be strict guidelines but design foundations to help get teams to the next level of competiveness. Over the years, I have observed that teams typically need a few years of competing before they learn all the helpful tips and tricks that are used by winning teams. With the help of this book, a team should be able to learn some of these steps earlier and use them as a foundation for creating its own winning ideas and designs.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The authors provide a brief introduction to fractional-order calculus, followed by design issues for fractional-order circuits of various orders and types. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated with current-mode and voltage-mode filter designs. Electronically tunable emulators of fractional-order capacitors and inductors are presented, where the behavior of the corresponding chips fabricated using the AMS 0.35um CMOS process has been experimentally verified. Applications of fractional-order circuits are demonstrated, including a pre-processing stage suitable for the implementation of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for detecting the QRS complexes of an electrocardiogram (ECG), a fully tunable implementation of the Cole-Cole model used for the modeling of biological tissues, and a simple, non-impedance based measuring technique for super-capacitors. \r\n\r\n"}

Only a few touch on practical applications. Soil Engineering: Testing, Design, and Remediation supplies the information needed to fill the gap between textbook learning and practical know-how.When engineers deal with major projects, such as the Teton Dam or the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they need high-tech solutions. More often than not, however, they deal with the foundations for warehouses, schools, medium-rise buildings, and residential structures, projects that need low-tech solutions. Ninety percent of the time consulting engineers don't require mathematical treatment or computer analysis, they require experience.Soil engineering problems cannot be resolved with textbook information alone. This book provides the practical meaning of the different aspects of soil mechanics, the use of unconfined compression test data, the meaning of consolidated tests, the practical value of lateral pressure, and more. In addition to the technical aspects of foundation investigation, in the real world the shadow of litigation looms over every consultant's head. The author covers legal issues in detail.After several years in foundation investigation most consultants realize that soil engineering is a combination of art and science. Soil Engineering: Testing, Design and Remediation demystifies this connection and supplies real-world examples of practical applications. This hands-on, ready reference will be essential tool for any consultant working in the field.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Written by Chris Maser, international consultant on forest ecology, sustainable forestry practices, and sustainable development, Social-Environmental Planning: The Design Interface Between Everyforest and Everycity focuses on community based solutions, emphasizing how the heavy lifting of sustainability will always be done inside existing cities and communities. Based on the author's forty years of experience, the book covers the sustainability of the planet and its population when dealing with climate change. The book provides an in-depth understanding of the commonalities of pattern between Everyforest and Everycity. Maser suggests that before changes can be made, society must adapt to the circumstances of global climate change as they already are, and then determine what we can do to stabilize global climate as effectively and quickly as possible. He explores the reciprocal interface between communities and the landscape and how, when this interface is recognized and understood, it can create solutions that work. With this comprehension, people can adapt to the present and begin determining what they can do now to leave the planet a little better for each generation.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Martin（Bob大叔）的支援。如果您仔細閱讀本書第四章及第五章，會發現原來要成為一個新模式真是不簡單啊！那些面世的模式全都是大師們的心血結晶，無價的經驗寶藏。\r\n\r\n\t早期，有些人會批評《Design Patterns》不適合作為學習設計模式的第一本書，或許是因為有些人看的、寫的專案不夠多，所以無法體會其中的奧妙。後來，由於設計模式被大多數高級軟體工程師接受了，因此寫了非常多的相關書籍來介紹設計模式，漸漸地，設計模式不再那麼令人敬畏，也成為了軟體設計的顯學。而這類比較容易理解的書籍，通常都是採用最適合初階讀者的寫法，也就是舉出實例來說明模式。而且舉的例子越是程式設計師理解的例子，就越能使程式設計師學會設計模式並加以活用。\r\n\r\n\t有些書籍，只針對每個模式舉出一個例子，但無法找出一些好例子，可同時應用多個模式來完成同一個例子中不同的功能要求，這樣的寫作法，常常誤導了讀者，違背了設計模式的目的。換言之，一招半式是要如何走江湖呢？本書有別於那些書籍，在本書第二章中，作者以程式設計師最能理解的檔案系統為例，實際示範如何應用六個模式來解決檔案系統不同的功能需求，這六個模式之間的相互合作方式，讓人眼睛為之一亮。讚嘆道︰「原來設計模式是這樣用的啊！」\r\n\r\n\t許多讀者都在期待《設計模式》的第二版，而第二版會是什麼樣子呢？這很難說（也可能不會有第二版了），但至少可以肯定的是，本書作者對於《設計模式》第二版所能做出的貢獻，都已經寫在這本書當中了。\r\n\r\n本書讚譽\r\n\r\n\t本書將幫你理解如何將《設計模式》──其實是任何關於設計模式的書籍──當作一本珍貴的指南，而不是一些累贅的規定。── 朗訊科技公司，貝爾實驗室 James O. Coplien\r\n\r\n\t這本技術書的文風非常吸引人，我從未讀過這麼精彩的技術書。John真的已經爐火純青、游刃有餘，他對技術主題的把握如此堅實、精準又引人入勝。── 西門子公司 Frank Buschmann\r\n\r\n\t對於套用設計模式有點經驗的程式設計師來說，遇到問題該採用這個模式還是那個模式，常常陷入難以抉擇的問題，看起來這樣也可以，那樣也可以，如果您也曾有過如此的經歷，那麼您一定要好好看完這本書，相信對您會非常助益。\r\n\tPS︰大學（甚或科大）不教設計模式，實在是令人難以理解？！── 博碩文化 總編輯 陳錦輝\r\n\r\n\t大師已逝，墨跡留香── 網路留言\r\n\r\n"}

To cope with this scope and complexity, many Signals and Systems texts are often organized around the \"numerical examples\" of a system. With such organization, students can see through the complexity of Signals and Systems, they can learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the Authors extensive experience of teaching and research, the book is written with such a reader in mind. The Book is intended for a course on signals & systems at the senior undergraduate level and above. The authors consider all the requirements and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for filter design and signal processing. Key features of the International Edition: The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve the signals & systems problems. The textbook includes a wealth of problems with solutions.Worked-out examples have been included to explain new and difficult concepts and to expose the reader to real-life signal processing problems.The inclusion of FIR and IIR filter design further enriches the contents of the book.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The concepts developed result from the convergence of three research and development goals:  - to create a unifying metric to compare the value of different energy sources - coal-burning power plant, wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, etc. - to be integrated into the electric power grid and to replace the typical metric of costs\/profit; - to develop a new nonlinear control tool that applies power flow control, thermodynamics, and complex adaptive systems theory to the energy grid in a consistent way; and - to apply collective robotics theories to the creation of high-performance teams of people and key individuals in order to account for human factors in controlling and selling power into a distributed, decentralized electric power grid.  All three of these goals have important concepts in common: exergy flow, limit cycles, and balance between competing power flows. In place of the typical zero-sum, stability vs. performance, linear controller design process, the authors propose a unique set of criteria to design controllers for a class of systems nonlinear with respect to both performance and stability, and seamlessly integrating information theoretic concepts. A combination of thermodynamics with Hamiltonian systems provides the theoretical foundation which is then realized in a series of connected case studies. It allows the process of control design to be viewed as a power flow control problem, balancing the power flowing into a system against that being dissipated within it and dependent on the power being stored in it - an interplay between kinetic and potential energies. Highlights of several of the case studies feature current renewable energy problems such as the future of electric power grid control, wind turbine load alleviation, and novel control designs for micro-grids that incorporate wind and sunlight as renewable energy sources. Human factors and the sustainability of self-organizing systems are dealt with as advanced topics. Research scientists, practicing engineers, engineering students, and others with a background in engineering will be able to develop and apply this methodology to their particular problems.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Makes a great gift for neuroscientists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, mindfulness practitioners and meditators, students and teachers. Those who have had a brain illness or injury, and their caregivers, have also found inspiration in these coloring pages. Let your imagination run wild while you color the designs in this book and use the 3 blank brains at the back to create your own fanciful design. An extra half inch margin at the binding leaves you enough room to cut out a finished brain and each design is sized for a standard 8x10 inch frame. Use colored pencils or markers. You'll want to stick a piece of blank paper behind a page before using markers in case of bleed through to protect the design behind it. About the artist: Laura Bundesen lives in western Massachusetts. She has been making artwork since the 1980's and creating neuroscience themed artwork since 2014, working primarily as a mixed media artist using fabric, thread and paint to explore the magical human brain. Most of her pieces feature a large dose of hand embroidery, an art practice that she finds both soothing and meditative, much like coloring.

Handbook of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety in Engineering Design not only encompasses a depth of research into engineering design methods and techniques ranging from quantitative probability theory and expert judgement in Bayesian analysis to qualitative possibility theory, fuzzy logic and uncertainty in Markov analysis; from reliability block diagrams, fault trees, event trees and cause-consequence diagrams to Petri nets, genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks; but it also covers a breadth of research into the concept of integrity in engineering design. Such breadth of research is represented by the inclusion of the topics of reliability and performance, availability and maintainability, and safety and risk, in an overall concept of designing for integrity during the different phases of the engineering design process. These topics add significant value to the theoretical expertise and practical experience of process, chemical, civil, mechanical, electrical, and electronic engineers, by considering process engineering design from the point of view of \"what should be achieved\" to meet criteria for designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety.\r\n                    \r\n"}

At the example of an optimal expansion of the German railway network until 2030, the author derives a tailor-made decomposition technique for multi-period network design problems. Next, he develops a general framework for the solution of network design problems via aggregation of the underlying graph structure. This approach is shown to save much computation time as compared to standard techniques. Finally, the author devises a modelling framework for the approximation of the robust counterpart under ellipsoidal uncertainty, an often-studied case in the literature. Each of these three approaches opens up a fascinating branch of research which promises a better theoretical understanding of the problem and an increasing range of solvable application settings at the same time.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Their functionality is almost completely well-defined - ideally there exist complete precise descriptions of the source and target languages. Additional descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, programming system and programming environment, and to other compilers and libraries are often available. This book deals with the analysis phase of translators for programming languages. It describes lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, specification mechanisms for these tasks from the theory of formal languages, and methods for automatic generation based on the theory of automata. The authors present a conceptual translation structure, i.e., a division into a set of modules, which transform an input program into a sequence of steps in a machine program, and they then describe the interfaces between the modules. Finally, the structures of real translators are outlined. The book contains the necessary theory and advice for implementation. This book is intended for students of computer science. The book is supported throughout with examples, exercises and program fragments.   \r\n\r\n"}

There are several advantages to employing additive manufacturing as the primary additive manufacturing process. However, there exist several challenges that need to be addressed systematically. A couple such issues are alloy design and process development. Traditionally alloys designed for conventional cast\/powder metallurgical processes were fabricated using advanced AM processes. This is the wrong approach considering that the alloys should be coined based on the process characteristics and meta-stable nature of the process. Hence, we must focus on alloy design and development for AM that suits the AM processes. The AM processes, however, improve almost every day, either in terms of processing capabilities or processing conditions. Hence, the processing part warrants a section that is devoted to these advancements and innovations. Accordingly, the present Special Issue (book) focuses on two aspects of alloy development and process innovations. Here, 45 articles are presented covering different AM processes including selective laser melting, electron beam melting, laser cladding, direct metal laser sintering, ultrasonic consolidation, wire arc additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. I believe that this Special Issue bears is vital to the field of AM and will be a valuable addition.\r\n                    \r\n"}

There are several advantages to employing additive manufacturing as the primary additive manufacturing process. However, there exist several challenges that need to be addressed systematically. A couple such issues are alloy design and process development. Traditionally alloys designed for conventional cast\/powder metallurgical processes were fabricated using advanced AM processes. This is the wrong approach considering that the alloys should be coined based on the process characteristics and meta-stable nature of the process. Hence, we must focus on alloy design and development for AM that suits the AM processes. The AM processes, however, improve almost every day, either in terms of processing capabilities or processing conditions. Hence, the processing part warrants a section that is devoted to these advancements and innovations. Accordingly, the present Special Issue (book) focuses on two aspects of alloy development and process innovations. Here, 45 articles are presented covering different AM processes including selective laser melting, electron beam melting, laser cladding, direct metal laser sintering, ultrasonic consolidation, wire arc additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. I believe that this Special Issue bears is vital to the field of AM and will be a valuable addition.\r\n                    \r\n"}

New theories have been developed with new technology and systems designs in both hardware and software. They are widely applied to our daily life to solve real problems in diverse areas such as science, engineering, agriculture, e-commerce, education, robotics, government, medicine, games and animation, medical imaging analysis and diagnosis, military, and national security.The foundation of this field can be traced back to the late Prof. King-Sun Fu, one of the founding fathers of pattern recognition, who, with visionary insight, founded the International Association for Pattern Recognition in 1978. Almost 30 years later, the world has witnessed this field's rapid growth and development. It is probably true to say that most people are affected by or use applications of pattern recognition in daily life.Today, on the eve of 25th anniversary of the unfortunate and untimely passing of Prof. Fu, we are proud to produce this collection works from world renowned professionals and experts in pattern recognition and machine vision in honor and memory of the late Prof. King-Sun Fu. We hope this book will help further promote not only fundamental principles, systems, and technologies but also the vast range of applications that help in solving problems in daily life.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Despite the advantages of the widely used TiO2, the yield of the conversion of sun power into chemical energy that can be achieved with this material is limited prompting the research and development of a number of structural, morphological and chemical modifications of TiO2, as well as a number of novel photocatalysts with very different composition. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a systematic account of the current understanding of the relationships between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and photoactivity. The already long list of photocatalysts phases and their modifications is increasing day by day. By approaching this field from a material sciences angle, an integrated view allows readers to consider the diversity of photocatalysts globally and in connection with other technologies. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a valuable road-map, outlining the common principles lying behind the diversity of materials, but also delimiting the imprecise border between the contrasted results and the most speculative studies. This broad approach makes it ideal for specialist but also for engineers, researchers and students in related fields.\r\n\r\n"}

What we produce, how we serve customers and other stakeholders, and even how we understand how the world works is all affected by the design of models and solutions. Designers have an unprecedented opportunity to use their skills to make meaningful, sustainable change in the world--if they know how to focus their skills, time, and agendas. In Design is the Problem: The Future of Design Must be Sustainable, Nathan Shedroff examines how the endemic culture of design often creates unsustainable solutions, and shows how designers can bake sustainability into their design processes in order to produce more sustainable solutions.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This \"design in nature\" often takes on remarkably similar patterns, which can be explained under one unifying Constructal Law. This book explores the unifying power of the Constructal Law and its applications in all domains of design generation and evolution, ranging from biology and geophysics to globalization, energy, sustainability, and security. The Constructal Law accounts for the universal tendency of flow systems to morph into evolving configurations that provide greater and easier access over time. The Constructal Law resolves the many and contradictory ad hoc statements of \"optimality\", end design, and destiny in nature, such as minimum and maximum entropy production and minimum and maximum flow resistance, and also explains the designs that are observed and copied in biomimetics. Constructal Law and the Unifying Principle of Design covers the fundamentals of Constructal Theory and Design, as well as presenting a variety of state-of-the-art applications. Experts from the biological, physical and social sciences demonstrate the unification of all design phenomena in nature, and apply this knowledge to novel designs in modern engineering, such as vascularization for self-healing and self-cooling materials for aircraft, and tree fins and cavities for heat transfer enhancement.\r\n                    \r\n"}

According to the author, dashboards have become a popular means to present critical information at a glance, yet few do so effectively. He purports that when designed well, dashboards engage the power of visual perception to communicate a dense collection of information efficiently and with exceptional clarity and that visual design skills that address the unique challenges of dashboards are not intuitive but rather learned. The book not only teaches how to design dashboards but also gives a deep understanding of the concepts--rooted in brain science--that explain the why behind the how. This revised edition offers six new chapters with sections that focus on fundamental considerations while assessing requirements, in-depth instruction in the design of bullet graphs and sparklines, and critical steps to follow during the design process. Examples of graphics and dashboards have been updated throughout, including additional samples of well-designed dashboards.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Working in simulated design teams, students will experience all aspects of video game design, from the planning stages, through the design and programming, and concluding with a capstone project.  Each chapter in the SDG is correlated to the textbook chapter. There are several activities for each chapter. The last chapter in the SDG is a capstone project that requires students to apply all of the knowledge acquired in the textbook and SDG. The activities in the software design guide make use of The Games Factory 2, which is a fully-functioning game engine (not a demo version). The Games Factory 2 is available free to schools with the purchase of the software design guide. It may be installed on any school owned or leased computer.\r\n\r\n"}

While the measurements discipline is very broad, careful selection of topical coverage, establishes the physical principles and practical techniques for quantifying many engineering variables that have multiple engineering applications.\r\n\r\n\tIn the sixth edition, Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements continues to emphasize the conceptual design framework for selecting and specifying equipment, test procedures and interpreting test results. Coverage of topics, applications and devices has been updated—including information on data acquisition hardware and communication protocols, infrared imaging, and microphones.

Everything--from biological life to inanimate systems--generates shape and structure and evolves in a sequence of ever-improving designs in order to facilitate flow. River basins, cardiovascular systems, and bolts of lightning are very efficient flow systems to move a current--of water, blood, or electricity. Likewise, the more complex architecture of animals evolve to cover greater distance per unit of useful energy, or increase their flow across the land. Such designs also appear in human organizations, like the hierarchical \"flowcharts\" or reporting structures in corporations and political bodies. All are governed by the same principle, known as the constructal law, and configure and reconfigure themselves over time to flow more efficiently. Written in an easy style that achieves clarity without sacrificing complexity, Design in Nature is a paradigm-shifting book that will fundamentally transform our understanding of the world around us.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This creates amazing opportunities and challenges for designers. If we want to create products and services that have the power to educate people so they may live better lives, or help to reduce the time people take to do certain tasks, we first need an understanding of how these people think and work - what makes them \"tick\"  The premise of this book is the need to understand how people \"behave\"; their habits, motivators and drivers, as a critical way to better understand what a great customer experience for your audience looks like, facilitating better design decisions. The book will lead you from understanding behavior, to extracting customer insights that can launch you into the design of something that makes a difference to people's lives - all presented in a fun, practical and non-academic way.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Do you find yourself forced into generic data architectures and universal data models? Do you find yourself warping the business to fit a purchased application? Do you find yourself pushed into developing physical databases without formal logical design? Do you find disparate data throughout the organization? If the answer to any of these questions is Yes, then you need to read Data Resource Design to help guide you through a formal design process that produces a high quality data resource within a single common data architecture.Most public and private sector organizations do not consistently follow a formal data resource design process that begins with the organization's perception of the business world, proceeds through logical data design, through physical data design, and into implementation. Most organizations charge ahead with physical database implementation, physical package implementation, and other brute-force-physical approaches. The result is a data resource that becomes disparate and does not fully support the organization in its business endeavors.Data Resource Design describes how to formally design an organization's data resource to meet its current and future business information demand. It builds on Data Resource Simplexity, which described how to stop the burgeoning data disparity, and on Data Resource Integration, which described how to understand and resolve an organization's disparate data resource. It describes the concepts, principles, and techniques for building a high quality data resource based on an organization's perception of the business world in which they operate. Like Data Resource Simplexity and Data Resource Integration, Michael Brackett draws on five decades of data management experience building and managing data resources, and resolving disparate data in both public and private sector organizations. He leverages theories, concepts, principles, and techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, such as human dynamics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, and biology, and applies them to properly designing data as a critical resource of an organization. He shows how to understand the business environment where an organization operates and design a data resource that supports the organization in that business environment.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In fact, the book was inspired by the many questions David receives every day from the more than 600,000 designers who visit his three blogs (Logo Design Love, Identity Designed, and DavidAirey.com) each month.  How do I find new clients? How much should I charge for my design work? When should I say no to a client? How do I handle difficult clients? What should I be sure to include in my contracts?   David's readers-a passionate and vocal group-regularly ask him these questions and many more on how to launch and run their own design careers. With this book, David finally answers their pressing questions with anecdotes, case studies, and sound advice garnered from his own experience as well as those of such well-known designers as Ivan Chermayeff, Jerry Kuyper, Maggie Macnab, Eric Karjaluoto, and Von Glitschka. Designers just starting out on their own will find this book invaluable in succeeding in today's hyper-networked, global economy.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The second narrowed the focus to fundamental patterns for building sophisticated concurrent and networked software systems and applications. This volume uses design patterns to present techniques for implementing effective resource management in a system. The patterns are covered in detail making use of several examples providing directions to the readers on how to implement the presented patterns. Additionally, the volume presents a thorough introduction into resource management and a case study where the patterns are applied to the domain of mobile radio networks. The patterns are grouped by different areas of resource management and hence address the complete lifecycle of resources: resource acquisition, coordination and release.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent \"grand design\" of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion--or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity. According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the \"multiverse\"--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a \"theory of everything\" the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It is arguably one of the most significant enhancements in Ethernet's history. 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution explains both the \"what\" and the \"why\" of the technology standard being set today. It covers which decisions were elective and which were dictated by the design goals by using a multipart approach that first explains what SPB is, before transitioning into narrative form to describe the design processes and decisions behind it. To make SPB accessible to the data networking professional from multiple perspectives, the book:    Provides a \"Reader's Companion\" to the standard   Dissects the different elements of SPB   Offers applications and potential futures for the technology   802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution will appeal to system implementers, system and network architects, academics, IT professionals, and general networking professionals.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Starting at the transistor level, this book introduces basic concepts in the design of system-level complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS). It uses practical examples to illustrate circuit construction so that readers can develop an intuitive understanding rather than just assimilate the usual conventional analytical knowledge. As SoCs become increasingly complex, analog\/radio frequency (RF) system designers have to master both system- and transistor-level design aspects. They must understand abstract concepts associated with large components, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and phase-locked loops (PLLs). To help readers along, this book discusses topics including:    Amplifier basics & design   Operational amplifier (Opamp)   Data converter basics   Nyquist-rate data converters   Oversampling data converters   High-resolution data converters   PLL basics   Frequency synthesis and clock recovery Focused more on design than analysis, this reference avoids lengthy equations and instead helps readers acquire a more hands-on mastery of the subject based on the application of core design concepts. Offering the needed perspective on the various design techniques for data converter and PLL design, coverage starts with abstract concepts--including discussion of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and MOS transistors--and builds up to an examination of the larger systems derived from microCMOS design.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This book is aimed at hackers of all skill levels and explains the classical principles and techniques behind beautiful designs by deconstructing those designs in order to understand what makes them so remarkable. Author and designer David Kadavy provides you with the framework for understanding good design and places a special emphasis on interactive mediums. You'll explore color theory, the role of proportion and geometry in design, and the relationship between medium and form. Packed with unique reverse engineering design examples, this book inspires and encourages you to discover and create new beauty in a variety of formats.  Breaks down and studies the classical principles and techniques behind the creation of beautiful design Illustrates cultural and contextual considerations in communicating to a specific audience Discusses why design is important, the purpose of design, the various constraints of design, and how today's fonts are designed with the screen in mind Dissects the elements of color, size, scale, proportion, medium, and form Features a unique range of examples, including the graffiti in the ancient city of Pompeii, the lack of the color black in Monet's art, the style and sleekness of the iPhone, and more  By the end of this book, you'll be able to apply the featured design principles to your own web designs, mobile apps, or other digital work.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This book describes BEAM✲, an agile approach to dimensional modeling, for improving communication between data warehouse designers, BI stakeholders and the whole DW\/BI development team. BEAM✲ provides tools and techniques that will encourage DW\/BI designers and developers to move away from their keyboards and entity relationship based tools and model interactively with their colleagues. The result is everyone thinks dimensionally from the outset! Developers understand how to efficiently implement dimensional modeling solutions. Business stakeholders feel ownership of the data warehouse they have created, and can already imagine how they will use it to answer their business questions. Within this book, you will learn: ✲ Agile dimensional modeling using Business Event Analysis & Modeling (BEAM✲) ✲ Modelstorming: data modeling that is quicker, more inclusive, more productive, and frankly more fun! ✲ Telling dimensional data stories using the 7Ws (who, what, when, where, how many, why and how) ✲ Modeling by example not abstraction; using data story themes, not crow's feet, to describe detail ✲ Storyboarding the data warehouse to discover conformed dimensions and plan iterative development ✲ Visual modeling: sketching timelines, charts and grids to model complex process measurement - simply ✲ Agile design documentation: enhancing star schemas with BEAM✲ dimensional shorthand notation ✲ Solving difficult DW\/BI performance and usability problems with proven dimensional design patterns Lawrence Corr is a data warehouse designer and educator. As Principal of DecisionOne Consulting, he helps clients to review and simplify their data warehouse designs, and advises vendors on visual data modeling techniques. He regularly teaches agile dimensional modeling courses worldwide and has taught dimensional DW\/BI skills to thousands of students. Jim Stagnitto is a data warehouse and master data management architect specializing in the healthcare, financial services, and information service industries. He is the founder of the data warehousing and data mining consulting firm Llumino.\r\n                    \r\n"}

One fateful rainy day, a bored kid asks his grandfather \"what in the world is graphic design?\" Starting with that innocent question, A History of Graphic Design for Rainy Days takes its readers on a charmingly illustrated and cleverly revealing whirlwind tour through this creative discipline's milestone developments, personalities, and technologies. With its engaging design, humorous narratives, and fun-filled exercises, this activity book offers an entertaining look at the many aspects of graphic design--from typography's humble beginnings at the dawn of the industrial revolution to the internet-based font distribution of today; from the first printed Christmas cards in the 1850s to David Carson's revolutionary layouts of the late 1980s; from styles including art nouveau, Dada, Bauhaus, and psychedelic to innovators such as William Morris, Jan Tschichold, Saul Bass, and Jessica Helfand. A History of Graphic Design for Rainy Days has been created by Studio 3, the student-driven design agency from Oslo that also brought you the bestselling Hyperactivitypography from A to Z.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Research shows that rich-prospect interfaces can offer an intuitive and highly flexible alternative environment for information browsing, assisting hypothesis formation and pattern-finding. This unique book offers a clear discussion of this form of interface design, including a theoretical basis for why it is important, and examples of how it can be done. It will be of interest to those working in the fields of library and information science, human-computer interaction, visual communication design, and the digital humanities as well as those interested in new theories and practices for designing web interfaces for library collections, digitized cultural heritage materials, and other types of digital collections.\r\n                    \r\n"}

You've developed apps that impressed and performed, and now you're ready to jump into development practices that will leave you with more effective, efficient, and professional level apps. This book is the element you need to make the jump from journeyman to master.  All too often, developers grind through building good apps on willpower and a vigorous focus on code development, leaving them unaware of and unable to benefit from the underlying structural and functional design patterns.  Pro Objective-C Design Patterns for iOS will teach you those design patterns that have always been present at some level in your code, but were never recognized, acknowledged, or fully utilized. Implementation of specific pattern approaches will prove their value to any developer working in the iOS application arena. You'll learn to master classic patterns like singleton, abstract factory, chain of responsibility, and observer. You'll also discover less well-known but useful patterns like memento, composite, command, and mediator.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Yet, the frustrations and convoluted \"work-arounds\" often encountered make it clear that there is substantial room for improvement. Drawn from more than 60 years of combined experience studying, implementing, and teaching about performance in human-technology systems, Display and Interface Design: Subtle Science, Exact Art provides a theoretically-based yet practical guide for ecological display and interface design. Written from the perspective of cognitive systems engineering and ecological interface design, the book delineates how to design interfaces tailored to specific work demands, leverage the powerful perception-action skills of the human, and use powerful interface technologies wisely. This triadic approach (domain, human, interface) to display and interface design stands in sharp contrast to traditional dyadic (human, interface) approaches. The authors describe general principles and specific strategies at length and include concrete examples and extensive design tutorials that illustrate quite clearly how these principles and strategies can be applied. The coverage spans the entire continuum of interfaces that might need to be developed in today's work places.  The reason that good interfaces are few and far between is really quite simple: they are extremely difficult to design and build properly. While there are many books available that address display design, most of them focus on aesthetic principles but lack scientific rigor, or are descriptive but not prescriptive. Whether you are exploring the principles of interface design or designing and implementing interfaces, this book elucidates an overarching framework for design that can be applied to the broad spectrum of existing domains.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The goal of this book is to educate developers on the fundamentals of object oriented programming, design patterns, principles, and methodologies that can help you become a better programmer. Design patterns and principles enable loosely coupled and highly cohesive code, which will improve your code's readability, flexibility, and maintenance. Each chapter addresses a layer in an enterprise ASP.NET application and shows how proven patterns, principles, and best practices can be leveraged to solve problems and improve the design of your code. In addition, a professional-level, end-to-end case study is used to show how to use best practice design patterns and principles in a real website.  Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns is for ASP.NET developers who are comfortable with the .NET framework but are looking to improve how they code and understand why design patterns, design principles, and best practices will make their code more maintainable and adaptable. Readers who have had experience with design patterns before may wish to skip Part 1 of the book, which acts as an introduction to the Gang of Four design patterns and common design principles, including the S.O.L.I.D. principles and Martin Fowler's enterprise patterns. All code samples are written in C# but the concepts can be applied very easily to VB.NET. This book covers well-known patterns and best practices for developing enterprise-level ASP.NET applications. The patterns used can be applied to any version of ASP.NET from 1.0 to 4.0. The patterns themselves are language agnostic and can be applied to any object oriented programming language. Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns can be used both as a step-by-step guide and as a continuous source of reference to dip into at your leisure. The book is broken into three distinct sections. Part 1 is an introduction to patterns and design principles. Part 2 examines how patterns and principles can be used in the various layers of an ASP.NET application. Part 3 represents an end-to-end case study showcasing many of the patterns covered in the book. You may find it useful to work through the chapters before reading the case study, or you may find it easier to see the patterns in action by reading the case study section first and referring back to Part 2 for a more detailed view on the patterns and principles used. Within those parts the coverage includes:   The origins of the Gang of Four design patterns, their relevance in today's world, and their decoupling from specific programming languages. An overview of some common design principles and the S.O.L.I.D. design principles follows, and the chapter ends with a description of Fowler's enterprise patterns. Layering Your Application and Separating Your Concerns A description of the Transaction Script pattern followed by the Active Record, with an exercise to demonstrate the pattern using the Castle Windsor project. The Domain Model pattern demonstrated in an exercise with NHibernate and a review of the domain-driven design (DDD) methodology Patterns and principles that can be used construct your objects and how to make sure that you are building your application for scalability and maintainability: Factory, Decorator, Template, State, Strategy, Composite, Specification and Layer Supertype. Design principles that can improve your code's maintainability and flexibility; these include Dependency Injection, Interface Segregation, and Liskov Substitution Principle Service Oriented Architecture, the Facade design pattern, messaging patterns such as Document Message, Request-Response, Reservation, and the Idempotent pattern The Data Access Layer: Two data access strategies are demonstrated to help organize your persistence layer: Repository and Data Access Objects.

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent \"grand design\" of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion--or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet--if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the \"top-down\" approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the \"multiverse\"--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a \"model-dependent\" theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete \"theory of everything.\" If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason. A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform--and provoke--like no other.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The author uses MATLAB(R) and SIMULINK(R) for dynamic system simulation, Minitab(R) for statistical applications, and Mathcad for general engineering computations. Rather than consult the extensive manuals of these software packages, readers can access handy, sharply focused material in the appendices to assist in comprehension.After introducing the techniques behind the design of experiments (DOE), the book discusses several technologies for implementing vibration isolation, the design of a high-accuracy pressure transducer, and the use of cold-wire thermometers for measuring rapidly fluctuating fluid temperatures. It then focuses on a basic piezoelectric actuator that provides translational motions up to about 1mm full scale with nanometer resolution, before covering instruments used to measure the viscosity of liquids as well as two special classes of microphones (infrasonic and ultrasonic) and their important specialized applications. The book also presents statistical tools, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, for experiments; the design and applications of thrust stands for measuring vector forces and torques; and the analysis and simulation of a shock calibrator. It concludes with a discussion of how shock testing machines can help reduce or prevent mechanical failures.Spanning system dynamics, measurement, and control, this book addresses the needs of practicing engineers working in instrumentation fields. It focuses on instruments for various applications, from geophysics to mechanical and aerospace engineering.\r\n                    \r\n"}

At times, this book references code and give sample projects; other times, it delves into interaction and visual design. It doesn't take a CS doctorate to appreciate or even understand, but some familiarity with programming is assumed. Who is this book for? Lots of people. Mac developers looking to do a killer iPhone app might want to know the hard-won lessons or philosophies of others; iPhone hackers looking to step up their game might be trying to figure out how much to emulate Apple. Anyone who appreciates a success story will hopefully enjoy this book, but it's also inspirational. How technical is it? Parts of this book assumes basic knowledge of C or other object-oriented programming languages. In some cases, we reference specific Apple frameworks and interface guidelines. It will also help to be familiar with the Apple environment, from the quirks of the App Store to technologies inside OS X. How were these interviewees chosen? The five core chapters of this book are based on a series of interviews with five of the 2009 winners of Apple Design Awards (ADAs) for the iPhone. MLB.com, the makers of the sixth ADA winner, MLB.com at Bat, did not consent to be interviewed for this book in order to protect their intellectual property.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Applications range from crane and fork-lift positioning to RFID-like asset tracking and access control and many more. Especially indoor applications show severe performance degradation due to heavy multipath effects. Since the resolution of wireless localization systems for all kinds of modulation techniques is proportional to the applied signal bandwidth, systems using ultra-wideband signals offer an excellent potential for accurate indoor positioning. With the accredited bandwidth for UWB systems, an accuracy in the range of a few centimeters is possible. This thesis presents the analysis and design of a pulsed frequency modulated ultra-wideband system for high precision local positioning. Up to now, all commercial available systems are based on the usage of very narrow pulses to generate ultra-wideband signals. To overcome typical limitations of the pure impulse UWB technology, a novel system concept is presented in this work. It combines pulse technology with frequency modulated continuous wave radar technology by chopping the FMCW signal into short pulses. On the one hand this fulfills the UWB regulation requirements, and on the other hand precise control of the signal shape is given for the whole bandwidth. This allows the use of advanced synchronization and distance measurement approaches. The main emphasis of this work is the investigation and realization of this pulsed frequency modulated UWB positioning system. The PFM-UWB system is based on a well-known LPR system, which is extended to an UWB system. Theoretical calculations, simulations and measurements are used to define the system and evaluate its performance. With an implemented demonstrator system, a high accuracy in dense multipath indoor environments can be achieved. Conclusive measurements, that demonstrate the abilities of the developed positioning system, round off this work.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The ability to offer such high data rates in 100MHz bandwidth requires a very high spectral efficiency and, hence, the need for multi-antenna techniques (MIMO) with spatial multiplexing, fast dynamic link adaptation and packet scheduling, wideband access techniques, and most likely non-contention based spectrum sharing among multiple operators. Many of these required technology components and techniques are well researched and established. Adaptive PHY-MAC Design for Broadband Wireless Systems explains how one can integrate and optimize their use in providing the target cell data rates with high availability. The authors address the ability to cope with interference and enhanced physical layer processing and, simultaneously, with the multifaceted system level design. This book also focuses on the selection of technology components and techniques, which leads to the highest spectral efficiency and peak data rate availability with reasonable Quality of Service (QoS) support, such as improved outage scenario, reduced delay, guaranteed bit rate, etc.In short, this book will answer questions such as how individual techniques relate to each other, how can we benefit the gains by suitable combinations of different technologies, and how to choose different technological solutions in different scenarios, etc.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Chances are that if you come up with an idea for an app, it's already on the Store and in abundance. In order to catch users' interest, you'll have to differentiate yours. Most developers seem to take the easy route by simply lowering their price. The problem is that it's so easy to do that everybody can do it. And if they do, you've gained nothing. On the contrary, you've lost an income that could possibly motivate you to keep improving and updating your app and thereby sustain your name as a reliable developer users can trust their investment to. If you choose to take the difficult route, however, and differentiate on quality--the route that not everybody can take--you'll not only become a better developer but also earn the respect from other developers and users who'll be willing to spend real time and money on your app. The ten authors of this book have all released successful apps and can testify to how going that extra mile, or ten, has paid off in many aspects of their lives as iPhone developers. By reading their takes on how to make an app stand out from the rest, you'll gain some of the inspiration and insight that could make your app the one in its category that users will want.\r\n                    \r\n"}

They are asked to produce increasingly complex systems using the latest technologies, but these technologies are changing faster than ever. They are asked to produce better quality designs with a shorter time-to-market. They are asked to implement increasingly complex functionality but, more importantly, to satisfy numerous other constraints. To achieve these current goals, the designer must be aware of such design constraints and, more importantly, the factors that have a direct effect on them.One of the challenges facing embedded system designers is the selection of the optimum processor for the application in hand: single-purpose, general-purpose, or application specific. Microcontrollers are one member of the family of the application specific processors.Digital System Design concentrates on the use of a microcontroller as the embedded system's processor and how to use it in many embedded system applications. The book covers both the hardware and software aspects needed to design using microcontrollers and is ideal for undergraduate students and engineers that are working in the field of digital system design.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Where do you start? What do you need to learn? To whom can you look for help? If you've ever asked any of these questions, you'll know how difficult it is to find the answers. I asked myself these same questions many years ago in a little village outside of Bangalore, India, where I was teaching programming and interactive media at an international school. All my students were playing games and they all wanted to create games, but there were no comp- hensive books or online resources available on how to do this. A little bit of research turned up something surprising: not only did basic game design require relatively little programming knowledge but the same set of techniques could also be used over and over again in different contexts to create completely different kinds of games. It was fun to do, the results were immediate, and it was a great creative outlet. The result of this research was an in-house textbook on game design that formed the basis of three high school-level courses and inspired the writing of this book.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The continuing debate over the possibilities of genetic engineering has been spirited, but so far largely confined to the realms of bioethics and public policy. Design and Destiny approaches the question in religious terms, discussing human germline modification (the genetic modification of the embryonic cells that become the eggs or sperm of a developing organism) from the viewpoints of traditional Christian and Jewish teaching. The contributors, leading religious scholars and writers, call our attention not to technology but to humanity, reflecting upon the meaning and destiny of human life in a technological age. Many of these scholars argue that religious teaching can support human germline modification implemented for therapeutic reasons, although they offer certain moral conditions that must be met. The essays offer a surprising variety of opinions, including a discussion of Judaism's traditional presumption in favor of medicine, an argument that Catholic doctrine could accept germline modification if it is therapeutic for the embryo, an argument implying that \"traditional\" Christian teaching permits germline modification whether for therapy or enhancement, and a \"classical\" Protestant view that germline modification should be categorically opposed.

With its rich combination of technologies, Ajax provides astrong foundation for creating interactive web applications with XML or JSON-based web services by using JavaScript in the browser to process the web server response.Ajax Design Patterns shows you best practices that can dramatically improve your web development projects. It investigates how others have successfully dealt with conflictingdesign principles in the past and then relays that information directly to you.The patterns outlined in the book fall into four categories: Foundational technology: Examines the raw technologies required for Ajax developmentProgramming: Exposes techniques that developers have discovered to ensure their Ajax applications are maintainableFunctionality and usability: Describes the types of user interfaces you'll come across in Ajax applications, as well as the new types of functionality that Ajax makes possibleDevelopment: Explains the process being used to monitor, debug, and test Ajax applicationsAjax Design Patterns will also get you up to speed with core Ajax technologies, such as XMLHttpRequest, the DOM, and JSON. Technical discussions are followed by code examples so you can see for yourself just what is-and isn't-possible with Ajax. This handy reference will help you to produce high-quality Ajax architectures, streamline web application performance, and improve the userexperience.Michael Mahemoff holds a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, where his thesis was \"Design Reuse in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction.\" He lives in London and consults on software development issues in banking, health care, and logistics.\"Michael Mahemoff's Ajax Design Patterns is a truly comprehensive compendium of webapplication design expertise, centered around but not limited to Ajax techniques. Polished nuggets of design wisdom are supported by tutorials and real-world code examples resulting in a book thatserves not only as an intermediate to expert handbook but also as an extensive reference for building rich interactive web applications.\"--Brent Ashley, remote scripting pioneer\r\n                    \r\n"}

Consistent success stems from honing your skills, cultivating good techniques, and hard work. Design engineering, a field often considered an intuitive process not amenable to scientific investigation, is no exception. Providing descriptive theory, broad context, and practical examples, Design Engineering: A Manual for Enhanced Creativity explores how to quantify creativity, codify inspiration, and document a process seemingly based solely on intuition. The authors discuss how to clarify the design task, conceptualize candidate solutions, and search for alternatives. They delineate how these phases fit into an industrial context, including engineering product development, and what to consider during design engineering to satisfy all customers. The book discusses activities and methods for performing engineering design work in a rational, reviewable, and documented way, increasing the likelihood of finding an optimal solution. The presentation covers substantiated use of intuition and opportunism as an integral part of rational, systematic, and methodical designing. It examines the influence of other topics on the work, such as psychology, computers, teamwork, application of methods, and education. The authors recommend that results from these less systematic activities be brought into the rational and systematic framework to document the results. Based on the authors' extensive industrial experience, the book elucidates a coherent body of knowledge of design engineering. The book clearly details an easily applicable theory that not only gives you solid design tools, but can also be adapted to any existing design situation.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This book offers numerous examples to help you avoid the many pitfalls that entrap new and not-so-new database designers. Through the help of use cases and class diagrams modeled in the UML, youll learn how to discover and represent the details and scope of the problem in question.Database design is not an exact science, and solid database design principles and examples help demonstrate the consequences of simplifications and pragmatic decisions. The rationale is to try to keep it simple, but allow room for development as situations change or resources permit. The book also features an introduction for implementing the final design in a relational database.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The most personal of personal computers are the portables. We carry these gadgets with us wherever we go, whether they're laptops, smartphones, or the coolest new Web-surfing devices. The Race for Perfect tells the story of two generations of entrepreneurs, designers, and engineers as they have struggled to make ever-better portables. Steve Hamm takes the reader into a world where inspiration, design, engineering, and marketing come together to produce wave upon wave of the innovative products that we love to talk about and use. From the earliest days of portable computing, 40 years ago, entrepreneurs and designers have pushed forward relentlessly in a quest to create the perfect device. Their efforts have produced a few fabulous successes and many failures. But they never give up. They're driven by the basic rule of the tech industry: innovate or die. In addition to a fascinating read, The Race for Perfect offers valuable lessons for business people in any industry, revealing how they must INNOVATE constantly to differentiate their products CREATE design principles that are timeless INTEGRATE design and engineering so products are both useful and fun to use IMPROVE quality and convenience without compromise TAP social networks to turn customers into fans At the center of this tale is the story of a single product, Lenovo's ThinkPad X300 laptop. Lenovo, the first Chinese company to seek to establish a global consumer brand, bought IBM's PC division in 2005 primarily to get the company's storied ThinkPad laptops. The X300 was conceived as a \"halo\" product that would draw customers to Lenovo's entire line. Woven through The Race for Perfect is a case study of how this ambitious company, with teams in Japan, the United States, and China, marshaled its resources to pursue laptop perfection. As X300 came close to the finish line, it collided head-on with Apple's super-slim MacBook Air---with surprising results.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The ability to publish something and have it appear immediately and globally is an empowering feeling. I'll never forget the first rush I felt when, as a print designer, I could simply \"upload\" some files and have them be immediately visible, rather than waiting in trepidation for the boxes to return from the printer. Back then the Web was simpler, there were fewer materials and tools, and \"styling\" was something you hacked together using bizarre hacks and workarounds to achieve even the simplest of tasks. The browser landscape was equally testing. Now we're in a much better position. We have a wonderful thing called CSS that allows us to style pages with concise style rules and leave the HTML to describe the content, not the pr- entation. Content can be repurposed for different media. But anyone keen to learn web design (from scratch, or to improve their existing skills) has a bewildering job on their hands. The publishing market is saturated with good books on web design, HTML, and CSS. Yet if you were asked for a single book that encompasses all three, and that someone could understand without assuming any prior \"Internet knowledge,\" what would you recommend? Still trying to think of one? A regular contributor to . net\/Practical Web Design magazine, Craig Grannell has written The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design for this purpose.\r\n                    \r\n"}

In this book, you'll find a number of concrete Flash usability solutions that use elements such as navigation menus, data filtering, forms, content loaders, Flash liquid layouts, help tips, and many other features. You'll learn how each of these solutions actually improves on what is possible with HTML and JavaScript. In each case, you'll see how users interact with the website feature, and how it gives users the most intuitive, enjoyable experience possible while using your application. You'll get a step-by-step analysis of how to program and build each solution, and how to make it scalable, maintainable, and reusable. The book concludes with a case study that showcases the solutions developed in the previous chapters, all working together in a single application. This example puts all the pieces together and highlights just how, with some thought and consideration, Flash can improve usability on the Web. This book is essential reading for all Flash designers and developers, from beginners seeking valid solutions to veteran Flashers looking for a fresh perspective on application design, interaction, and reusability.\r\n                    \r\n"}

This text provides an introduction to the design tools used in engineering design. It focuses on the first two steps of the design process: determination of need\/problem clarification and conceptualization.  In addition, an overview of materials and manufacturing methods is presented. The use of Excel has been incorporated throughout the text for performing routine calculations, leaving more time for the creative aspects of the design process. Finally, the text contains an extensive discussion of systematic concept generation using the theory of inventive problem solving, TRIZ.   Below is a listing of the book's table of contents:   1.

If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.  Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.  The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:  Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.  There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Although still considered emerging and in some cases radical, their principles will become, by necessity, the wave of the future in design. A thorough exploration of the subject, Product Design for the Environment: A Life Cycle Approach presents key concepts, basic design frameworks and techniques, and practical applications. It identifies effective methods and tools for product design, stressing the environmental performance of products over their whole life cycle. After introducing the concepts of Sustainable Development, the authors discuss Industrial Ecology and Design for Environment as defined in the literature. They present the life cycle theory and approach, explore how to apply it, and define its main techniques. The book then covers the main premises of product design and development, delineating how to effectively integrate environmental aspects in modern product design. The authors pay particular attention to environmental strategies that can aid the achievement of the requisites of eco-efficiency in various phases of the product life cycle. They go on to explore how these strategies are closely related to the functional performance of the product and its components, and, therefore, to some aspects of conventional engineering design. The book also introduces phenomena of performance deterioration, together with principles of design for component durability, and methods for the assessment of residual life. Finally, the book defines entirely new methods and tools in relation to strategic issues of Life Cycle Design. Each theme provides an introduction to the problems and original proposals based on the authors' experience. The authors then discuss the implementation of these new concepts in design practice, differentiating between levels of intervention and\r\n                    \r\n"}

Additional subjects encompass linear observers; compensator design by the separation principle; linear, quadratic optimum control; random processes; and Kalman filters.Concrete examples of how state-space methods can be used to advantage in several representative applications are woven into the fabric of the text and the homework problems. Many of the models are drawn from aerospace and inertial instrumentation; other examples are derived from chemical process control, maritime operations, robotics, and energy systems.\r\n                    \r\n"}

The volume clarifies where we already encounter these intelligent machines and where we may come across them in the near future: in industry, in the military and in everyday settings; at nurseries and retirement homes; in our bodies and in the cloud; when shopping and having sex; in video games and, of course, in film and literature. In a series of in-depth essays and interviews, experts such as the science-fiction author Bruce Sterling, novelist Douglas Coupland, architect Philip Beesley, and the design duo Dunne & Raby explore the question of how we deal with our environment becoming increasingly digital, smarter and more autonomous. They highlight our often ambivalent relationship to new technologies and discuss the opportunities and challenges that are posed to us as individuals and as a society in this context. Hello, Robot. broadens the scope of the discussion to the ethical and political questions with which we are faced today in the light of technological advances in robotics, while confronting us with the contradictions that are often found in the answers to these questions.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design is that resource. It is a comprehensive, single-source guide that explains the design process by illustrating the full range of issues involved, how they are interrelated, and how they can be quickly and accurately addressed. The materials are presented in logical order relative to the manner a MEMS designer needs to apply them. For example, in order for a project to be completed correctly, on time, and within budget, the following diverse yet correlated issues must be attended to during the initial stages of design and development: Understanding the fabrication technologies that are available  Recognizing the relevant physics involved for micron scale devices Considering implementation issues applicable to computer aided design  Focusing on the engineering details and the subsequent evaluation testing  Maintaining an eye for detail regarding both reliability and packaging These issues are fully addressed in this book, along with questions and problems at the end of each chapter that promote review and further contemplation of each topic. In addition, the appendices offer information that complement each stage of project design and development.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Restrictions to the pressure head and the calculations of head-loss due to friction in the pipes imply nonlinear constraints. Heuristic as well as deterministic algorithms have been developed during the last 30 years to solve this problem. Their implementation is based on floating point arithmetic. In a branch and bound algorithm the decision for every branch depends on numerical results. Therefore even small errors may have farreaching consequences. In the context of this thesis the software package WaTerInt has been developed which contains the first verified algorithm for water distribution design optimization to avoid this problem. WaTerInt is based on the branch and bound algorithm developed by Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan and results from interval analysis, allowing rigorous bounds together with a guarantee of existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, a new additional constraint propagation technique is introduced which decreases the computational time for expansion networks by approximately one third to one half. The computational results using non-verified floating point calculations are found to show numerical artifacts. For example, it is possible that a problem is identified as infeasible that in reality does have a solution, or that the lower bound for the optimal solution is larger than the upper bound. Using verified calculations, these artifacts are avoided, the obtained results are always reliable. Nevertheless for this improved quality, in the current implementation the computational time for verified calculations takes on average fifteen times the time needed for the calculation without error analysis when relying just on pure floating point arithmetic. This factor could probably be decreased when not depending on interpretation overhead of MATLAB, especially for object orientation. In addition to the model based on Hazen-Williams formula as used by Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan, the optimization problem is reformulated to contain Darcy-Weisbach and Colebrook-White equations. The algorithm has been expanded to be able to solve this more accurate problem as well, and again a verified version is presented. Essentially, detailed investigation of the nonlinearity of the implicitly defined Colebrook-White equation was necessary to retain certain monotonicity and convexity arguments. The adjacency property is proved for this new problem as well. However, the computational effort is around forty times higher than for the Hazen-Williams problem. To combine the advantages of the Darcy-Weisbach optimization problem with the more simple structure and lower computational times of Hazen-Williams, the coefficients of this formula are adjusted to obtain a closer approximation. Finally, verified results have been used to compare results obtained for different head loss formulae and hydraulic parameters for known test networks. When regarding the whole life span of a pipe network it occurs that energy costs form a significant part of the overall costs, except when water is mainly delivered by gravity. In summary, recently developed verification techniques are combined with a branch and bound algorithm to investigate the practicability of obtaining error estimates along with the calculation of the optimal solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. They are applied to water network distribution design, both to the known branch and bound algorithm of Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan and to the one for the more realistic network model based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation.\r\n                    \r\n"}

It features a novel way of teaching interactive designers how to create and improve their designs to incorporate the highest degree of fun. As the book shows, designing for fun is all about making interactive products like games highly entertaining, engaging, and addictive. The book's unique approach of providing a highly visual storyboard approach combined with a narrative on the art and practice of designing for fun is sure to be a hit with game and interactive designers, At first glance A Theory of Fun for Game Design is a book that will truly inspire and challenge game designers to think in new was; however, its universal message will influence designers from all walks of life. This book captures the real essence of what drives us to seek out products and experiences that are truly fun and entertaining. The author masterfully presents his engaging theory by showing readers how many designs are lacking because they are predictable and not engaging enough. He then explains how great designers use different types of elements in new ways to make designs more fun and compelling. Anyone who is interested in design will enjoy how the book works on two levels--as a quick inspiration guide to game design, or as an informative discussion that details the insightful thinking from a great mind in the game industry.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Straightforward coverage includes an integrated treatment of both classical and modern control system methods. The text emphasizes design with discussions of problem formulation, design criteria, physical constraints, several design methods, and implementation of compensators. Discussions of topics not found in other texts--such as pole placement, model matching and robust tracking--add to the text's cutting-edge presentation. Students will appreciate the applications and discussions of practical aspects, including the leading problem in developing block diagrams, noise, disturbances, and plant perturbations. State feedback and state estimators are designed using state variable equations and transfer functions, offering a comparison of the two approaches. The incorporation of MATLAB throughout the text helps students to avoid time-consuming computation and concentrate on control system design and analysis.\r\n\r\n"}

We all increaslingly experience such applications when we telephone airlines, banks, and other consumer companies for information. Key to the success of all these applications is the design and development of effective voice user interfaces (VUIs.) This book shows how to design, deploy, and assess VUIs. The author team from Nuance, one of the two market leaders, includes a computer scientist, a psychologist, and a linguist, reflecting the broad range of expertise required for such work. The book itself combines discussion of essential VUI design principles and practical methodology with real-world examples of good design. It should become the standard reference to VUI design.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes. It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns. A software design pattern can be identified as \"a recurring solution to a recurring problem.\" Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another? But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started. Crawford and Kaplan's J2EE Design Patterns approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software. They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction \/ process modeling, and interoperability.  J2EE Design Patterns offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face: Maintenance (Extensibility) Performance (System Scalability) Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling) Transactions (process Modeling) Messaging (Interoperability) And with its careful balance between theory and practice, J2EE Design Patterns will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience.\r\n                    \r\n"}

However, very little discussion has been devoted to the practice of object-oriented programming at its most fundamental level--that is, building classes. The truth is, whatever code you write in Visual Basic .NET, you are writing classes that fall within the class hierarchy of the .NET Framework. Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook was conceived as a guide to help you design these classes effectively, by looking at what control you have over your classes and how Visual Basic .NET turns your class definitions into executable code. This book will give you a deep and thorough understanding of the implications of all the decisions you can make in designing a class, so you are equipped to develop classes that are robust, flexible, and reusable. In short, this book will take you from a theoretical understanding of the basic principles of object-oriented programming to the ability to write well-designed classes in actual applications.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Elliott's Antenna Theory and Design is one of the most significant works in electromagnetic theory and applications. In its broad-ranging, analytic treatment, replete with supporting experimental evidence, Antenna Theory and Design conveys fundamental methods of analysis that can be used to predict the electromagnetic behavior of nearly everything that radiates. After more than two decades, it remains a key resource for students, professors, researchers, and engineers who require a comprehensive, in-depth treatment of the subject. In response to requests from many of our members, IEEE is now reissuing this classic. Newly revised, it once again will be an invaluable textbook and an enduring reference for practicing engineers. The IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory offers outstanding coverage of the field. It consists of new titles of contemporary interest as well as reissues and revisions of recognized classics by established authors and researchers. The series emphasizes works of long-term archival significance in electromagnetic waves and applications. Designed specifically for graduate students, researchers, and practicing engineers, the series provides affordable volumes that explore and explain electromagnetic waves beyond the undergraduate level.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Her works are a reflection of a profoundly independent vision and are featured in the permanent collections of museums throughout the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.  In this lavishly illustrated, full-color book, the designer for the first time communicates the ideas that have guided and inspired her. Each aspect of the design process is analyzed?variety, spontaneity, line, contour, shading, and texture, among others?to show how the best works are the result of a dialogue between creator and object, the result of which is an environment that is pleasurable, comfortable, and elegant. The language in which this dialogue is conducted, ?the language of things, ? is one in which Zeisel's fluency is unparalleled, and her thoughts, read alongside the photos of her stunning creations and those that have inspired her, make this book indispensable to every enthusiast of art, ceramics, and design.\r\n                    \r\n"}

No, no. Instead, the authors show design patterns applied to real-world architectural scenarios, so you can witness the patterns in action, reaping benefits along the way! The core of this book contains three case studies, which explain design pattern application in each main tier of an application: data, business, and presentation layers. These case studies flesh out your understanding of design patterns, illustrating how the scenarios can be realistically employed and recognized by all Visual Basic .NET programmers. Also featured: how design patterns can be used in conjunction with .NET Remoting, to be applied across tiers, as well as within them. And since many VB .NET programmers may not be wholly familiar with UML, the authors also provide a UML primer as an appendix.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Even fewer build the essential theoretical framework when presenting algorithms and implementation details of modern coding systems. Without abandoning the theoretical foundations, Fundamentals of Information Theory and Coding Design presents working algorithms and implementations that can be used to design and create real systems. The emphasis is on the underlying concepts governing information theory and the mathematical basis for modern coding systems, but the authors also provide the practical details of important codes like Reed-Solomon, BCH, and Turbo codes. Also setting this text apart are discussions on the cascading of information channels and the additivity of information, the details of arithmetic coding, and the connection between coding of extensions and Markov modelling.

In this book, Petroski delves deeper into the mystery of invention, to explore what everyday artifacts and sophisticated networks can reveal about the way engineers solve problems.Engineering entails more than knowing the way things work. What do economics and ecology, aesthetics and ethics, have to do with the shape of a paper clip, the tab of a beverage can, the cabin design of a turbojet, or the course of a river? How do the idiosyncrasies of individual engineers, companies, and communities leave their mark on projects from Velcro(R) to fax machines to waterworks?Invention by Design offers an insider's look at these political and cultural dimensions of design and development, production and construction.Readers unfamiliar with engineering will find Petroski's enthusiasm contagious, whether the topic is the genesis of the Ziploc baggie or the averted collapse of Manhattan's sleekest skyscraper. And those who inhabit the world of engineering will discover insights to challenge their customary perspective, whether their work involves failure analysis, systems design, or public relations. Written with the flair that readers have come to expect from his books, Invention by Design reaffirms Petroski as the master explicator of the principles and processes that turn thoughts into the many things that define our made world.\r\n                    \r\n"}

However, many busy Java programmers have yet to learn about design patterns and incorporate this powerful technology into their work. Java Design Patterns is exactly the tutorial resource you need. Gentle and clearly written, it helps you understand the nature and purpose of design patterns. It also serves as a practical guide to using design patterns to create sophisticated, robust Java programs. This book presents the 23 patterns cataloged in the flagship book Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides. In Java Design Patterns, each of these patterns is illustrated by at least one complete visual Java program. This practical approach makes design pattern concepts more concrete and easier to grasp, brings Java programmers up to speed quickly, and enables you to take practical advantage of the power of design patterns.
