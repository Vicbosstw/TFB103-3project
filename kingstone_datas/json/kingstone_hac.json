Until recently, there was very little strategic information available to explain the value of ethical hacking and how tests should be performed in order to provide a company with insight beyond a mere listing of security vulnerabilities. Now there is a resource that illustrates how an organization can gain as much value from an ethical hack as possible. The Ethical Hack: A Framework for Business Value Penetration Testing explains the methodologies, framework, and unwritten conventions that ethical hacks should employ to provide the maximum value to organizations that want to harden their security. This book is unique in that it goes beyond the technical aspects of penetration testing to address the processes and rules of engagement required for successful tests. It examines testing from a strategic perspective, shedding light on how testing ramifications affect an entire organization. Security practitioners can use this resource to reduce their exposure and deliver a focused, valuable service to customers. Organizations will learn how to align the information about tools, techniques, and vulnerabilities that they gathered from testing with their overall business objectives.\r\n                    \r\n"}

Whether for synthesis in music production, recording in the studio, or mixing in live sound, the computer plays an essential part. Audio effects plug-ins and virtual instruments are implemented as software computer code. Music apps are computer programs run on a mobile device. All these tools are created by programming a computer.  Hack Audio: An Introduction to Computer Programming and Digital Signal Processing in MATLAB provides an introduction for musicians and audio engineers interested in computer programming. It is intended for a range of readers including those with years of programming experience and those ready to write their first line of code. In the book, computer programming is used to create audio effects using digital signal processing. By the end of the book, readers implement the following effects: signal gain change, digital summing, tremolo, auto-pan, mid\/side processing, stereo widening, distortion, echo, filtering, equalization, multi-band processing, vibrato, chorus, flanger, phaser, pitch shifter, auto-wah, convolution and algorithmic reverb, vocoder, transient designer, compressor, expander, and de-esser.   Throughout the book, several types of test signals are synthesized, including: sine wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, triangle wave, impulse train, white noise, and pink noise. Common visualizations for signals and audio effects are created including: waveform, characteristic curve, goniometer, impulse response, step response, frequency spectrum, and spectrogram. In total, over 200 examples are provided with completed code demonstrations.\r\n                    \r\n"}

So had many of the other scientists who had joined him for an invitation-only workshop on climate science in 2007, with geoengineering at the top of the agenda. We can't take deliberately altering the atmosphere seriously, he thought, because there's no way we'll ever know enough to control it. But by the second day, with bad climate news piling on bad climate news, he was having second thoughts. When the scientists voted in a straw poll on whether to support geoengineering research, Battisti, filled with fear about the future, voted in favor.While the pernicious effects of global warming are clear, efforts to reduce the carbon emissions that cause it have fallen far short of what's needed. Some scientists have started exploring more direct and radical ways to cool the planet, such as: Pouring reflective pollution into the upper atmosphereMaking clouds brighterGrowing enormous blooms of algae in the oceanSchemes that were science fiction just a few years ago have become earnest plans being studied by alarmed scientists, determined to avoid a climate catastrophe. In Hack the Planet, Science magazine reporter Eli Kintisch looks more closely at this array of ideas and characters, asking if these risky schemes will work, and just how geoengineering is changing the world.Scientists are developing geoengineering techniques for worst-case scenarios. But what would those desperate times look like? Kintisch outlines four circumstances: collapsing ice sheets, megadroughts, a catastrophic methane release, and slowing of the global ocean conveyor belt.As incredible and outlandish as many of these plans may seem, could they soon become our only hope for avoiding calamity? Or will the plans of brilliant and well-intentioned scientists cause unforeseeable disasters as they play out in the real world? And does the advent of geoengineering mean that humanity has failed in its role as steward of the planet--or taken on a new responsibility? Kintisch lays out the possibilities and dangers of geoengineering in a time of planetary tipping points.

Several key launch events will be held to herald this important new title, among them a major drinks reception for 1,000 people, hosted by Robert de Niro and introduced by Vanessa Redgrave. \"In Addressing Climate Change, world-renowned photographer Henry Dallal goes behind the scenes to capture the human drama of negotiating a global agreement on climate change. This book celebrates those who have dedicated their lives to addressing the seemingly impossible challenge of crafting international policy on this issue and should motivate the rest of us to take part in one of the most critical issues facing our generation.\"--Edward Norton, actor and UN Goodwill AmbassadorIn December 2015, the nations of the world will gather in Paris with an opportunity to make history by signing the first legally binding global agreement on Climate Change, commonly referred to as \"COP21.\" This will build on more than two decades of near-constant negotiations on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help nations adapt to the impacts of global climate change such as rising sea levels, threats to food production, and loss of biodiversity.Drawn from tens of thousands of images, this book is a celebration of the collective efforts of the nations and peoples of the world who have come together under the framework of the UN to reach a global agreement on the future of our common home.Award-winning photographer Henry Dallal has built a reputation for creating photographic books of rare beauty. Henry's work has been exhibited widely including at the Smithsonian Institution, Naples Museum of Art, and Guildhall and Windsor castles. He has also been honored to photograph Queen Elizabeth II.\r\n                    \r\n"}

I used to hear words like rootkit, buffer overflow,  and idle scanning,  and they just didn't make any sense. I asked other people and they didn't seem to know how these things work, or at least they couldn't explain them in a way that I could understand.  Counter Hack Reloaded  is the clearest explanation of these tools I have ever seen. Thank you!\" --Stephen Northcutt, CEO, SANS Institute \"Ed Skoudis does it again! With this new edition, Ed takes a phenomenal work to the next level! This book is a 'must-have' and a 'must-read' for anyone remotely associated with computers and computer security.\" --Harlan Carvey, CISSP, author of Windows Forensics and Incident Recovery \"Ed Skoudis is a rare individual. He knows the innards of all the various systems, knows all the latest exploits and defenses, and yet is able to explain everything at just the right level. The first edition of Counter Hack was a fascinating read. It's technically intriguing and very clear. . . . A book on vulnerabilities, though, will get out of date, and so we definitely needed this updated and significantly rewritten second edition.
