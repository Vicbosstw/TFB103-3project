The goal of Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) is to provide seamless access to GSM and GPRS mobile service networks via unlicensed spectrum technologies, including Bluetooth, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi. Expanding on the level of knowledge in this growing field, Unlicensed Mobile Access Technology: Protocols, Architectures, Security, Standards, and Applications presents the first complete cross-referenced resource exploring UMA and UMA-relevant technologies. When operating successfully, the technology supporting dual-mode enabled mobile terminals allows subscribers to roam freely and seamlessly between cellular networks. However, various technical challenges still occasionally impede clear communication. This book explores the complex issue of mobility management and emphasizes the need for intelligently designed vertical and horizontal handoff algorithms that will improve adaptability in heterogeneous wireless environments. In addition, it reviews the various strategies to guarantee Quality-of-Service (QoS) during movement and handoff. The first chapters introduce the basic technology of these systems and discuss QoS, resource management, mobility management, and security issues in UMA technology. The middle section concentrates on protocols and security challenges in UMA-related technologies, which include Bluetooth, WirelessPAN, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16). The final chapters present standard specifications and various applications. Comprised of contributions from world-wide experts, this book is a complete reference, offering guidance on all aspects of the technical and practical issues in UMA technology.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique considered is the potential for future generations (5G / 6G) mobile communication and most of the research have been focused on power-domain NOMA. However, this book makes an effort to contribute to understand another aspect of NOMA i.e code domain NOMA due to its better performance in a system where large number of resources and users grows unboundedly. Interleave division multiple access (IDMA) is an established framework for implementation of code domain NOMA transmission and the performance of IDMA depends greatly on the interleavers as they are used to distinguish among the users. So, in this book, a unique Interleaver has been proposed and analyzed for the suggested IDMA scheme.

Radio Access Technology Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108549737?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Access&pi=0,"Melhem,El Helou",Ingram      ,9783659719233.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9233/9783659719233.jpg,"

To cope with the rapid growth of mobile broadband traffic, various radio access technologies (e.g., HSPA, LTE, WiFi, and WiMAX) are being integrated and jointly managed. Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection, devoted to decide to what RAT mobiles should connect, is a key functionality to improve network performance and user experience. When intelligence is pushed to the network edge, mobiles make autonomous decisions regarding selection of their most appropriate RAT. They aim to selfishly maximize their utility. However, because mobiles have no information on network load conditions, their decisions may lead to performance inefficiency. Moreover, delegating decisions to the network optimizes overall performance, but at the cost of increased network complexity, signaling, and processing load. In this book, instead of favoring either of these decision-making approaches, we propose a hybrid decision framework: the network provides information for the mobiles to make robust RAT selections. More precisely, mobile users select their RAT depending on their individual needs and preferences, as well as on the monetary cost and QoS parameters signaled by the network.

Rather, this book is about what you can import, export and attach to and from an Access database and then use what has been exported to produce custom outputs in a variety of outputs which could enhance data visualization.Originally, I wanted to include ADO, DAO, ODBC, and OleDb into the mix but I'm realizing that these Access database related engines deserve their own books as these database related engines also have their own ways of working with Access to accomplish similar tasks and would make this rather straight forward and much less confusing e-book a lot easier to work with.

Written by an industry insider with state of the art research at their fingertips, this book describes the Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture, starting with currently deployed 4G, followed by the description of 5G requirements and why re-thinking of the RAN architecture is needed to support these. Based on these considerations, it explains how 5G network architecture, which is currently being defined, is likely to evolve. The aim is not merely to cover relevant standards and technologies as a purely academic exercise (although a significant part of the book will be dedicated to these), but to augment these by practical deployment, to illustrate why the RAN architecture is changing and where it is going. With 5G deployments on the horizon, there is a desire within companies to both re-think the RAN architecture and to change the proprietary nature of the RAN. Correspondingly, there is increased interest in academia, standards bodies and commercial entities involved in the area.

The major benefit of a remote desktop connection is being able to connect to your data from anywhere in the world. Your data is in one place that is easy to see and you no longer have to have software installed on your own computer. Azure is one of the best virtual computers and networks providers for remote desktop (RDP) connections. When you create Azure account, you pay as you go. You purchase Azure services with pay-as-you-go pricing. You pay only for what you use each month, with no upfront commitment, and cancel anytime. You must add your credit/debit card for billing to use pay as you go subscription.But I was looking for totally free subscription where I don't need to add my credit card for billing. I found there are two possible options for that: 1) A sandbox gives you access to Azure resources. Your Azure subscription will not be charged. The sandbox may only be used to complete training on Microsoft Learn. Creating the Azure Virtual machines using sandbox which is learning subscription, you can connect to the VM via RDP port but you cannot access to Internet through the Internet Explorer. 2) Alternatively Microsoft Azure provides a free $100 credit for students accounts registered through university emails (free student subscription for around one year). There is internet access in the VM machine under this type of subscription.Azure documentations is too deep and it is hard to be understand creating and managing virtual computers and networks in Auzre for remote access connection by any beginner.

This open access book summarizes the first two decades of the NII Testbeds and Community for Information access Research (NTCIR). NTCIR is a series of evaluation forums run by a global team of researchers and hosted by the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan. The book is unique in that it discusses not just what was done at NTCIR, but also how it was done and the impact it has achieved. For example, in some chapters the reader sees the early seeds of what eventually grew to be the search engines that provide access to content on the World Wide Web, today's smartphones that can tailor what they show to the needs of their owners, and the smart speakers that enrich our lives at home and on the move. We also get glimpses into how new search engines can be built for mathematical formulae, or for the digital record of a lived human life. Key to the success of the NTCIR endeavor was early recognition that information access research is an empirical discipline and that evaluation therefore lay at the core of the enterprise. Evaluation is thus at the heart of each chapter in this book. They show, for example, how the recognition that some documents are more important than others has shaped thinking about evaluation design. The thirty-three contributors to this volume speak for the many hundreds of researchers from dozens of countries around the world who together shaped NTCIR as organizers and participants. This book is suitable for researchers, practitioners, and students--anyone who wants to learn about past and present evaluation efforts in information retrieval, information access, and natural language processing, as well as those who want to participate in an evaluation task or even to design and organize one.

Nowadays, IP mobile devices need to employ a variety of different network access technologies to gain ubiquitous connectivity. This book reviews the authentication infrastructure challenges for Internet remote access supporting ubiquitous client mobility, and proposes a series of solutions obtained by adapting and reinforcing security techniques arising from different sources. The focus is on entity authentication protocols that can be carried both by the IETF PANA authentication carrier and by the EAP mechanisms, and possibly making use of an AAA infrastructure. The core idea is to adapt authentication protocols arising from the mobile telecommunications sphere to Internet remote access. A proposal is also given for Internet access using a public key based authentication protocol. The subsequent security analysis of the proposed protocols covers a variety of aspects, including: key freshness, DoS-resistance, and false-entity-in-the-middle attacks, in addition to identity privacy of users accessing the Internet via mobile devices. This book is destined to researchers or anyone else who is interested on authentication mechanisms for Internet remote access aiming ubiquitous mobility.

Nowadays, the number of wireless users accessing the Internet is increasing day by day and each user wants to experience better performance. The IEEE 802.11 based wireless mesh network is the promising technology to provide wireless broadband Internet connectivity to the wireless users. In order to access the Internet through the pre-deployed WMN, the user has to associate with one of the mesh access points present in the WMN. The user performance majorly depends on the access point with which he/she is associated with and hence the access point selection problem is considered as critical in the context of WMN. This research work is focused on the problem of how to select the best access point that provides the best quality of service to the user.

Determine your object relational mapper (ORM) of choice for enterprise applications using .NET Framework, and especially .NET Framework Core 3.1 and higher. Real-world examples and considerations are presented in this book to help you create robust and efficient database solutions. Throughout the text, actual problems, questions, and common pitfalls are provided to help you recognize optimal solutions for maximum success in the different application scenarios you might encounter. Practical Entity Framework begins with a simple overview of the two most common approaches to working with databases--database first and code first--and then focuses on working in a code first manner. Taking the code first approach allows the entire database to be built and maintained in code so there is never a situation in which you cannot restore the database schema. Additionally, the code first approach creates an entirely transparent record of changes to the database that is easily tracked in source control. Emphasis throughout the book is on leaving you well positioned to architect and lead data development efforts for your organization.What You Will LearnBuild robust and maintainable databases using a code first approachCreate and execute stored procedures, triggers, and functionsAnalyze and optimize performance of database queriesEnsure data integrity through keys, constraints, and relationshipsWho This Book Is For.NET developers who work with enterprise-level applications and need to interact with data structures and data within the back end data store, developers who want to take a code first approach to building database applications to prevent conflicts and optimize efficiency, and those who are moving into full-stack roles, or into senior and architectural roles, and will be responsible for database design and implementation

Cloud computing gives an opportunity to use Internet-based services by business organizations. Use of cloud infra structure will reduce start-up costs, lower capital expenditures for organizations. Organizations use cloud services on a pay-as-you-use basis, access applications only as needed, and quickly reduce or increase capacities. Security is a major concern for data stored on cloud.Security to the data and applications is provided by authorization and authentication. Authorization for accessing the data is provided by access control models.Traditional access control models are not sufficient to cater applications running on cloud due to its dynamic nature. Various attribute based access control models are proposed for cloud computing. This book discusses the various authorization security challenges and proposed attribute based access control models to ensure security. The authors discuss the extremely challenging topics of data ownership, privacy protection, majorly focuses on encryption based access control models. This book is mandatory reading for research scholars, students involved in security aspects of cloud computing.

In Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system, multi-access interference coordination has been planned to optimize the exploitation of radio resources, thus maximizing service quality, coverage and capacity. Many techniques aim to minimize inter-cell interference in LTE, such as fractional power control and spatial antenna techniques, including MIMO and SDMA. In LTE, the access technique rests on the OFDM modulation technique. The allocation of resources takes place both in time and frequency. These resources are allocated to user equipment according to a given frequency reuse approach.

This book covers a broader scope of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), from the background knowledge, to specific constructions, theoretic proofs, and applications. The goal is to provide in-depth knowledge usable for college students and researchers who want to have a comprehensive understanding of ABE schemes and novel ABE-enabled research and applications. The specific focus is to present the development of using new ABE features such as group-based access, ID-based revocation, and attributes management functions such as delegation, federation, and interoperability. These new capabilities can build a new ABE-based Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) solution that can incorporate data access policies and control into ciphertext. This book is also ideal for IT companies to provide them with the most recent technologies and research on how to implement data access control models for mobile and data-centric applications, where data access control does not need to rely on a fixed access control infrastructure. It's also of interested to those working in security, to enable them to have the most recent developments in data access control such as ICN and Blockchain technologies. Features    Covers cryptographic background knowledge for ABE and ABAC   Features various ABE constructions to achieve integrated access control capabilities   Offers a comprehensive coverage of ABE-based ABAC   Provides ABE applications with real-world examples   Advances the ABE research to support new mobile and data-centric applications

In increasingly knowledge-based societies and economies, data are a key resource. Enhanced access to publicly funded data enables research and innovation, and has far-reaching effects on resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness, creating benefits for society at large. Yet these benefits must also be balanced against associated risks to privacy, intellectual property, national security and the public interest. This report presents current policy practice to promote access to publicly funded data for science, technology and innovation, as well as policy challenges for the future. It examines national policies and international initiatives, and identifies seven issues that require policy attention.

The manual is priced to provide a high-quality lab manual with premium digital content at an affordable and reasonable price.   The lab manual incorporates the terminology and much of the artwork used in Erin Amerman's Human Anatomy & Physiology text, but can accompany any A&P textbook. The lab manual is available in three versions for your students: Main, Cat, and Pig. The Cat and Pig versions are identical to the Main version except that they include seven additional cat dissection and 9 additional pig dissection exercises, respectively, at the back of the lab manual.  Personalize learning with Mastering A&P   By combining trusted author content with digital tools and a flexible platform, Mastering personalizes the learning experience and improves results for each student. Mastering A&P provides an extension of learning, allowing students a platform to practice, learn, and apply knowledge outside of the classroom.  You are purchasing an  access card  only. Before purchasing, check with your instructor to confirm the correct ISBN. Several versions of the MyLab(TM) and Mastering(TM) platforms exist for each title, and registrations are not transferable. To register for and use MyLab or Mastering, you may also need a Course ID, which your instructor will provide.  If purchasing or renting from companies other than Pearson, the access codes for the Mastering platform may not be included, may be incorrect, or may be previously redeemed.

A top-down, programming-oriented approach to introductory computer graphic.  Computer animation and graphics are now prevalent in everyday life from the computer screen, to the movie screen, to the smartphone screen. The growing excitement about WebGL applications and their ability to integrate HTML5, inspired the authors to exclusively use WebGL in creating  Interactive Computer Graphics --the only introduction to computer graphics text for undergraduates that fully integrates WebGL and emphasizes application-based programming. The top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the course so students immediately begin to create their own 3D graphics, while the application programming interface (API) makes it easier to teach key graphics topics, including three-dimensional transformations, lighting and shading, client-server graphics, modeling, and implementation algorithms. The new edition uses WebGL and JavaScript for all the examples.  With the 8th Edition, and for the first time,  Interactive Computer Graphics moves into the world of interactive electronic textbooks, enabling students to experiment and view code and examples while reading. The convenient, simple-to-use mobile reading experience extends learning beyond class time.   For courses in computer science and engineering.   Pearson eText is a simple-to-use, mobile-optimized, personalized reading experience. It lets students add bookmarks, highlight, and take notes all in one place, even when offline. Seamlessly integrated videos engage students and give them access to the help they need, when they need it. Educators can easily schedule readings and share their own notes with students so they see the connection between their eText and what they learn in class -- motivating them to keep reading, and keep learning. And, reading analytics offer insight into how students use the eText, helping educators tailor their instruction.   NOTE:  This ISBN is for the Pearson eText access card. For students purchasing this product from an online retailer, Pearson eText is a fully digital delivery of Pearson content and should only be purchased when required by your instructor. In addition to your purchase, you will need a course invite link, provided by your instructor, to register for and use Pearson eText.

Fighting for Farming Justice,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200306050?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Access&pi=6,"Terri R,Jett",Routledge   ,9780367001605.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1605/9780367001605.jpg,"

This book provides a detailed discussion of four class-action discrimination cases that have recently been settled within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and have led to a change in the way in which the USDA supports farmers from diverse backgrounds.  These settlements shed light on why access to successful farming has been so often limited to white men and/or families, and significantly this has led to a change for opportunities in the way the USDA supports famers from diverse backgrounds. With chapters focusing on each settlement Jett provides an overview of the USDA before diving into a closer discussion of the four key settlements, involving African American farmers (Pigford), Native Americans (Keepseagle), Woman famers (Love) and Latino(a) farmers (Garcia), and the similarities between each. This title places and emphasis on what is happening in farming culture today, drawing connections between these four settlements and the increasing attention on urban farming, community gardens, farmers markets, organic farming and the slow food movement, through to the larger issues of food justice and access to food.  Fighting for Farming Justice will be of interest to scholars of food justice and the farming arena, as well as those in the fields of Agricultural Economics, Civil Rights Law and Ethic Studies.

Development of Chemistry-Based Screening Platform for Access to Mirror-Image Library of Natural Products,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108551963?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Access&pi=6,"Taro,Noguchi",Springer    ,9789811349171.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9171/9789811349171.jpg,"

This thesis mainly describes the development of a screening process for a mirror-image library of chiral natural products. It demonstrates how, by using mirror-image proteins for the screening of available natural products, unavailable mirror-image isomers of natural products can be screened in a mirror process. Moreover, as mirror-image isomers including target proteins and natural products are mainly prepared by means of chemical synthesis, the screening strategy presented here suggests the importance of organic chemistry. Natural products are commonly used as valuable resources for drug discovery. However, as they are mostly produced as single enantiomeric forms, researchers have tested only natural products bearing one stereochemistry available in nature. As natural products and their enantiomers have identical physicochemical properties and different biological activities, mirror-image isomers of natural products are promising candidates for novel medicinal resources.  In an effort to identify anticancer agents from the mirror-image library, chemical protein syntheses of some target oncoproteins, MDM2, MDMX and Grb2, and their applications to the chemical array screening process were achieved. In the course of this process the NP843 enantiomer, which is the enantiomer of an α-tocopherol derivative, was successfully identified as a novel MDM2-p53 interaction inhibitor. These results clearly show that a mirror-image library of chiral natural products represents an invaluable medicinal resource. Accordingly, the chemistry-based screening strategy described in this thesis will be of great interest to a broad range of chemists involved in natural product, medicinal, and synthetic chemistry.

Microsoft Access is a large, intimidating program. Unlike Word or Excel where users can perform basic tasks without much in the way of training, Access presents challenges from the outset. Most users never progress beyond creating simple tables and using Wizards to create basic forms and reports. At the same time, all users - from managers to researchers to administrative assistants - need to know that what they seek is embedded somewhere in their Access tables. Without a more sophisticated knowledge of how to extract and present that data, they are forced to rely on office gurus and overworked IT people to provide canned reports or one-size-fits-all solutions.This book changes all that by giving readers the skills required to etract the data they need (queries), build efficient front-ends for that data (forms), and publish the results in an attractive and easy-to-read format (reports). To that end, this book shuns the big Access picture and instead focuses intently on queries, forms, and reports. This in-depth approach will give the reader the skills and understanding he or she needs to get at the data and prove the old adage that knowledge is indeed power.

For courses in Technical Communication.   Fully centralizes the computer in the technical workplace, presenting how writers use computers throughout their communication process.   The networked computer, from smartphone to mainframe, has become the central hub of written, spoken, and visual communication in today's scientific and technical workplace. Firmly rooted in core rhetorical principles, Revel(TM)   Technical Communication Strategies for Today  presents computers as thinking tools that powerfully influence how we develop, produce, design, and deliver technical documents and presentations. This popular text helps communicators draft and design documents, prepare material for print and web publication, and make oral presentations. Speaking to today's readers, the narrative is ""chunked,"" so that readable portions of text are combined with graphics and can be ""raided"" by readers seeking the information they need.  Retaining these features, the 3rd Edition of Revel  Technical Communication Strategies for Today  also marks an important shift to drawing readers' attention to the centralization of innovation and entrepreneurship in the technical workplace. Revised chapters, new case studies, and new exercises and projects demonstrate that those who know how to write clearly, speak persuasively, and design functional and attractive texts will be the most likely to succeed in today's innovation-based and entrepreneurial workplace.  Revel is Pearson's newest way of delivering our respected content. Fully digital and highly engaging, Revel replaces the textbook and gives students everything they need for the course. Informed by extensive research on how people read, think, and learn, Revel is an interactive learning environment that enables students to read, practice, and study in one continuous experience--for less than the cost of a traditional textbook.  NOTE:  This Revel Combo Access pack includes a Revel access code plus a loose-leaf print reference (delivered by mail) to complement your Revel experience. In addition to this access code, you will need a course invite link, provided by your instructor, to register for and use Revel.

Get Better Results with high quality content, exercise sets, and step-by-step pedagogy! The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning and Intermediate Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.

Pathways to College Mathematics  provides a general survey of topics to prepare students for liberal arts math, quantitative reasoning, or introductory statistics. This course offers an alternate path through developmental math, giving students who are going on to a non-STEM college-level course a one-semester alternative to the traditional two-semester algebra course. With a prerequisite of basic math or prealgebra, it's intended to accelerate non-STEM students through their developmental sequence, but can also prepare students for intermediate algebra if they intend to follow a STEM pathway.

Navidi/Monk, Elementary Statistics was developed around three central themes - Clarity, Quality, and Accuracy. These central themes were born out of extensive market research and feedback from statistics instructors across the country. The authors paid close attention to how material is presented to students, ensuring that the content in the text is very clear, concise, and digestible. High quality exercises, examples and integration of technology are important aspects of an Introductory Statistics text. The authors have provided robust exercise sets that range in difficulty. They have also focused keen attention to ensure that examples provide clear instruction to students. Technology is integrated throughout the text, providing students examples of how to use the TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculators, Microsoft Excel and Minitab. The accuracy of Elementary Statistics was a foundational principle always on the minds of the authors. While this certainly pertains to all aspects of the text, the authors also exhausted energy in ensuring the supplements have been developed to fit cohesively with the text.

Built for, and directly tied to the text, Mastering A&P enables an extension of learning, allowing students a platform to practice and learn, and then apply outside of the classroom.

Navidi/Monk, Elementary Statistics was developed around three central themes - Clarity, Quality, and Accuracy. These central themes were born out of extensive market research and feedback from statistics instructors across the country. The authors paid close attention to how material is presented to students, ensuring that the content in the text is very clear, concise, and digestible. High quality exercises, examples and integration of technology are important aspects of an introductory statistics text. The authors have provided robust exercise sets that range in difficulty. They have also focused keen attention to ensure that examples provide clear instruction to students. Technology is integrated throughout the text, providing students examples of how to use the TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculators, Microsoft Excel and Minitab. The accuracy of Elementary Statistics was a foundational principle always on the minds of the authors. While this certainly pertains to all aspects of the text, the authors also exhausted energy in ensuring the supplements have been developed to fit cohesively with the text.

	本書經由生活化的範例，告訴您如何利用Access 2016所提供的各式工具，輕鬆地完成資料管理的工作。尤其在逐步完成「進銷存管理系統」專案的實作後，就能明白利用Access 2016來管理資料，並設計出符合需求的解決方案，是一件很容易的事情。

書籍大綱
	基礎篇
	第1章系統開發前的準備
	本章告訴您如何站在系統分析師的角色，分析此專案的需求，以設計出符合目地的資料庫來。

	第2章建立資料庫
	本章將開始正式使用Access 2016。我們除了要熟悉Access 2016的作業環境之外，也要學習它的基本操作方式。

	第3章維護資料表的記錄
	本章將試著將一些資料輸入到資料庫裡，同時，也要試著操作Access 2016，利用它所提供的一些便利、好用的工具，來維護資料表裡面的記錄。

	本章將介紹如何利用Access 2016來建立資料表的關聯。

	第5章使用查詢來尋找資料
	本章將學習如何利用Access 2016來建立查詢物件。

	進階篇
	第6章建立表單
	本章主題放在表單物件的設計與應用上。表單物件為資料庫管理系統的人機介面，透過良好的表單設計，除了可以減少資料的輸入時間外，更能有效的提高資料正確性。

	第7章建立報表
	本章將介紹如何利用Access 2016來設計報表。報表為一個最終的輸出工具，因為設計資料庫的最終目的，不外乎就是蒐集這些資料，然後從蒐集的結果去進行統計與分析，以做為決策時的參考依據。

	實作篇
	第8章進銷存管理系統實作─基本資料維護作業
	本章將介紹如何快速的把基本資料維護的表單給設計完成。先用表單精靈建立新的表單，然後再手動調整表單的內容，整個開發效率可以說是又快又輕鬆。

	第9章進銷存管理系統實作─進貨作業
	在上一個章節，我們設計了一些基礎資料維護的表單。接下來的這一個章節，將繼續進行表單的設計。而本章所要實作的表單，將會比上一章還要複雜，我們將有機會在這一章學習到巨集的設計與VBA程式碼。

	第10章進銷存管理系統實作─出貨作業
	在接下來的這一個章節，我們將繼續進行表單的設計。而本章所要實作的表單，跟上一章的表單是很類似的，只是將進貨作業改為出貨作業而已。

	第11章進銷存管理系統實作─庫存管理作業
	在接下來的這一個章節，我們將繼續進行表單的設計。而本章所要實作的表單，也是庫存交易類的表單，分別為入庫單與出庫單。

	第12章進銷存管理系統實作─基本資料報表
	在接下來的這一個章節，我們將開始設計進銷存裡面的一些報表。而本章所要設計的報表，將會以前面在第五章所討論的查詢物件、第六章的表單設計與第七章的報表設計工具所綜合起來的概念來設計。

	第13章進銷存管理系統實作─進出貨統計報表
	這章所要開發的報表，主要與進貨作業及出貨作業有關。而您在開始閱讀本章之前，您必須熟悉第五章所討論的查詢、第六章的表單設計以及第七章的報表設計再加上基本VBA的撰寫能力，才能夠完成本章的每一支報表。

	第14章進銷存管理系統實作─庫存管理報表
	本章將延續報表設計的主題。而設計的範圍將集中在進銷存管理系統裡面中關於庫存管理的報表。

	第15章進銷存管理系統實作─系統管理
	本章將告訴您如何組織這些表單物件與報表物件，利用另外製作功能選單表單的方式，讓用戶可以非常容易的執行他想要進行的工作。除此之外，我們也將告訴您如何保護您所設計的系統，不要讓您的用戶去變更它；也要從資料庫管理師的角度，告訴您如何利用Access 2016 來進行資料庫管理的工作，以及如何把所設計好的資料庫分發給使用者來使用。

The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.

Personalize learning with MyLab Math  MyLab(TM) Math is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed to work with this text to engage students and improve results. Within its structured environment, students practice what they learn, test their understanding, and pursue a personalized study plan that helps them absorb course material and understand difficult concepts. The 6th Edition continues to expand the comprehensive auto-graded exercise options. The pre-existing exercises were carefully reviewed, vetted, and improved using aggregated student usage and performance data over time. In addition, MyLab Math includes new options to support conceptual learning, visualization, and student preparedness.  Showing why math matters  Gary Rockswold's  College Algebra with Modeling & Visualization, 6/e  can be used in co-requisite courses, or simply to help students who enter College Algebra without a full understanding of prerequisite skills and concepts. Rockswold doesn't just mention real-world examples; he teaches mathematical concepts through those applications. For example, if we look at Facebook usage over time, what might that tell us about linear growth and predictions? In this way, students learn the concepts in the context of the world they know, which leads to better understanding and retention. From there, the author shows a connection between application, modeling, and visualization.

Pathways to Astronomy breaks down introductory astronomy into its component parts. The huge and fascinating field of astronomy is divided into 86 units. These units are woven together to flow naturally for the person who wants to read the text like a book, but it is also possible to assign them in different orders, or skip certain units altogether. Professors can customize the units to fit their course needs. They can select individual units for exploration in lecture while assigning easier units for self-study, or they can cover all the units in full depth in a content-rich course. With the short length of units, students can easily digest the material covered in an individual unit before moving onto the next unit.

Engineering Economy presents a crisp, bold new design using color, highlighting and icons to focus on important concepts, terms, equations and decision guidelines. There are new features, new topics (such as ethics and staged decision making), and new online tools; yet no compromise on coverage, examples, or the well-accepted writing style of this popular text. Solved examples, problems and case studies target many of the current engineering challenges in areas such as energy, ethics, the environment, and the world's changing economics.McGraw-Hill's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item. Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a ""multi-step solution"" which helps move the students' learning along if they experience difficulty.

Get Better Results with high quality content, exercise sets, and step-by-step pedagogy!The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning and Intermediate Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces is a web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptivequestioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knowsand doesn't know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topicsshe is most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKSperiodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are alsoretained. ALEKS courses are very complete in their topic coverage and ALEKSavoids multiple-choice questions. A student who shows a high level of masteryof an ALEKS course will be successful in the actual course she is taking.

Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change by Martin Silberberg and Patricia Amateis has been recognized in the general chemistry market as an unparalleled classic. The revision for the eighth edition focused on continued optimization of the text. To aid in this process, we were able to use data from literally thousands of student responses to questions in LearnSmart, the adaptive learning system that assesses student knowledge of course content. The data, such as average time spent answering each question and the percentage of students who correctly answered the question on the first attempt, revealed the learning objectives that students found particularly difficult, which we addressed by revising surrounding text or adding additional learning resources such as videos and slideshows. The text still contains unprecedented macroscopic-to-microscopic molecular illustrations, consistent step-by-step worked exercises in every chapter, and an extensive range of end-of-chapter problems, which provide engaging applications covering a wide variety of interests, including engineering, medicine, materials, and environmental studies. Changes have been made to the text and applications throughout to make them more succinct, to the artwork to make it more teachable and modern, and to the design to make it more simplistic and open.

The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces is a web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptivequestioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knowsand doesn't know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topicsshe is most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKSperiodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics learned are alsoretained. ALEKS courses are very complete in their topic coverage and ALEKSavoids multiple-choice questions.

The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.Connect Math Hosted by ALEKS is an online assignment andassessment platform that helps students connect to their coursework andprepares them to succeed. An integrated ALEKS Initial Assessment helps youunderstand what your students know and are ready to learn next. This system isbuilt by educators for educators.

 Thinking Quantitatively: Communicating with Numbers,  by Eric Gaze, is more than a simple math course; it develops well-rounded students who can think critically, while showcasing how we use numbers to communicate in everyday life. Today's students need to be numerically literate to thrive in our increasingly technological society, and this program teaches students the math needed to develop the critical thinking skills required to make good decisions and become informed citizens. Thinking Quantitatively is intended for use in a credit-bearing quantitative reasoning or liberal arts math course for non-STEM students.  Built in MyMathLab, this program offers an interactive eText,  videos, just-in-time tutorials, assessment, and Guided Worksheets. The Guided Worksheets are a printed resource students will use for note-taking and working out problems, and can be used as an in-class resource or to facilitate learning at home in tandem with their MyMathLab course. Authentic, real-world problem-solving using spreadsheet software gives students the opportunity to develop sophisticated reasoning about everyday topics. Thinking Quantitatively enriches the learning experience by providing students with the tools to process the quantitative data that is pervasive in their everyday lives.  KEY TOPICS:  An Excel-lent Approach to Relationships; Ratios and Proportions; Units, Conversions, Scales, and Rates; Percentages; Linear Functions; Exponential Functions; Logical Arithmetic; Curve Fitting and Correlation; Financial Health; Logically; Spreadsheet Basics; Data Analysis Toolpak  MARKET:  For all readers interested in mathematical reasoning.   NOTE: Before purchasing, check with your instructor to ensure you select the correct ISBN. Several versions of Pearson's MyLab & Mastering products exist for each title, and registrations are not transferable. To register for and use Pearson's MyLab & Mastering products, you may also need a Course ID, which your instructor will provide.

	Excel → Access：資料建檔管理
	Access → Excel：共用報表資料
	VBA ＋ Access ：自動快捷精靈

	免學程式不用另外安裝軟體，最簡單易學的Office資料庫！
	一鍵搞定跨部門團隊專案合作或是滿足個人日常辦公需求！

	企業、公家機關等許多的組織及大部份的私人企業在日常業務中，
	收發訂單或財務會計等重要的資料管理或加工處理，
	多多少少都會接觸到數值、文字或日期等等多種資料。
	而大多數的人都會使用微軟的辦公軟體Excel與Access吧。
	本書的內容，是從基礎開始學習Excel與Access的協作。
	由模擬真實情境出發，首先將原本在Excel進行的訂單資料輸入、
	管理以及列印出貨單的業務移至Access。
	接著將Access的資料匯至Excel，進行資料分析之類的活用。
	根據一連串的範例實際操作，來學習Excel與Access的協作基礎。
	在本書的學習上希望在預先熟悉的知識、技巧，
	是關於Excel儲存格的公式或函數以及圖表基礎的掌握。
	至於Access是完全的初學者也沒有關係。


	▎Excel 的強項　　　　　　　　　　　▎Excel 的弱點
	● 簡單易懂　　　　　　　　　　　　● 複雜且大量資料的管理
	● 製作豐富多彩的圖表　　　　　　　● 只能做簡單的搜尋與更新
	● 豐富的函數庫　　　　　　　　　　● 報表或表單製作耗時
	● 強大的分析功能
	● 高普及率


	▎Access 的強項　　　　　　　　　　▎Access 的弱點
	● 複雜且大量的資料能更有效管理　　● 很難熟練掌握
	● 強大的搜尋功能　　　　　　　　　● 只能簡單的處理、分析資料
	● 輕鬆製作報表和表單　　　　　　　● 報表的自由度低
	　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ● 普及率低


	■將Excel與Access整合的優點
	　
	Excel和Access分別都有強項／弱點、優點／缺點。
	在工作上，不管是要選擇使用Excel還是Access，弱點和缺點都是令人猶豫的。
	　
	有效的解決方法就是將Excel和Access 整合。
	不只選用其一，將兩者適才適用的去管理一個資料。
	這樣的話就能「一舉兩得」，發揮兩者強項和優點。
	而且兩者的弱點和缺點都因為互相補足而消失。
	比起分別使用Excel 和Access，會是更佳的作業形式吧！

	整合模式的原則為以下的①和②。
	大致來說就是將資料使用Access來管理，Access不擅長的部分靠Excel來補足的方針。

	▎①將資料使用Access集中管理
	　
	將Excel 檔案分散的多頁活頁簿和工作表使用Access統一集中管理。
	過於複雜、管理困難的大量表格也能使用Access有效管理。
	資料的搜尋與更新也使用Access的「查詢」。
	輸入資料用的表單和報表基本上也使用Access來作業。

	▎②使用Excel 來進行資料的分析
	　
	從Excel 匯入儲存在Access中的資料、或是從Excel 擷取，
	使用Excel 強大的「樞紐分析表」和「樞紐分析圖」來分析資料。
	　
	①和②加上「雖安裝了Access但不習慣電腦操作的人也是少數」為前提，
	也進行以下的③、④整合。

	▎③將Access的資料使用Excel 來建立報表
	　
	假設有無論如何都想做，卻只有在Excel才能設計的版面設置，
	從Access將需要的資料匯入，貼到Excel的報表內。

	▎④從Excel 來新增、更新Access
	　
	假設無論如何都想在習慣使用的Excel上進行資料的輸入、修改，
	也可以在Excel 工作表內匯入Access的資料。

	　
	雖然還有其他幾個模式可以考慮，上述的①∼④可以說是普遍的整合模式，
	適用於許多的企業和部門。在本書中，①會在第三章、②∼④會在第四章以後解說。

Check with the seller before completing your purchase.  Kirk Trigsted, Kevin Bodden, and Randy Gallaher revolutionized developmental math when they created Intermediate Algebra, a completely clickable eText written from the ground up within MyMathLab(R). Recognizing that today's students have a tendency to jump straight to the homework instead of reading the text, Kirk Trigsted created an online learning environment that is a seamless mix of exposition, videos, interactive animations, tutorials, and assessment. This approach leverages the power of MyMathLab and leads students to interact with course materials and learn in a new way, which is proving to be more effective.

Our new course space, LaunchPad, combines an interactive e-book with high-quality multimedia content and ready-made assessment options, including LearningCurve adaptive quizzing. Curated pre-built units are easy to assign or adapt with your own material, such as video, animations, simulations, readings, quizzes, discussion groups and more. LaunchPad also provides access to a gradebook that provide a clear window on performance for your whole class, for individual students, and for individual assignments. While a streamlined interface helps students focus on what's due next, social commenting tools let them engage, make connections, and learn from each other. Use LaunchPad on its own or integrate it with your school's learning management system so your class is always on the same page. Contact your Rep to make sure you have access.

 Access 2010 是個簡易但卻功能強大的資料庫應用軟體，本書即由淺入深告訴您如何開發出一進銷存管理系統，此系統是針對國內精品服飾業所設計，但仍適合其他行業的進銷存管理。

 其中較特別的是，對於精品服飾業者，每年都有所謂的換季大拍賣，供應商會將折數逐次降低(例如5折、4折、3折等)，遇此狀況時，您只要輸入品牌及調降的折數，庫存中所有該品牌的產品將自動依指定的折數調降。本書除了附上一完整的進銷存管理系統外，對於系統中的各程式都有完整的介紹，所以您還可以針對此系統依您的需要加以適度的調整及擴充。

 ．認識資料庫及資料庫管理系統
 ．資料表的結構及建立方法
 ．資料表中的記錄的新增、修改、刪除
 ．認識關聯式資料庫及資料表間關聯的建立
 ．表單的設計方法、由表單編輯資料
 ．資料的查詢、動態查詢
 ．各式報表的製作、加上合計欄位
 ．切換表單的製作

Access 2010 是個簡易但卻功能強大的資料庫應用軟體，本書即由淺入深告訴您如何開發出一進銷存管理系統，此系統是針對國內精品服飾業所設計，但仍適合其他行業的進銷存管理。其中較特別的是，對於精品服飾業者，每年都有所謂的換季大拍賣，供應商會將折數逐次降低(例如5折、4折、3折等)，遇此狀況時，您只要輸入品牌及調降的折數，庫存中所有該品牌的產品將自動依指定的折數調降。本書除了附上一完整的進銷存管理系統外，對於系統中的各程式都有完整的介紹，所以您還可以針對此系統依您的需要加以適度的調整及擴充。★認識資料庫及資料庫管理系統★資料表的結構及建立方法★資料表中的記錄的新增、修改、刪除★認識關聯式資料庫及資料表間關聯的建立★表單的設計方法、由表單編輯資料★資料的查詢、動態查詢★各式報表的製作、加上合計欄位★認識及使用巨集指令★切換表單的製作與資料庫的加密

 Kirk Trigsted revolutionized the way this course is taught when he created College Algebra, a completely clickable eText that was written from the ground up within MyMathLab(R). Recognizing that today's students start with the homework instead of reading the text, Trigsted created an online learning environment that is a seamless mix of exposition, videos, interactive animations, tutorials, and assessment. This approach leverages the power of MyMathLab and leads students to interact with course materials in a way that is proving to be more effective.   With this new edition, Trigsted continues to innovate with a revised design with improved navigation and usability, expanded videos, and increased animation coverage. As with the prior edition, all multimedia elements, exercises, feedback, and content are written by the author himself, so that the students have a consistent voice throughout the eText.   KEY TOPICS:  Equations, Inequalities, and Applications; The Rectangular Coordinate System, Lines, and Circles; Functions; Polynomial and Rational Functions; Exponential and Logarithmic Functions and Equations; An Introduction to Trigonometric Functions; The Graphs of Trigonometric Functions; Trigonometric Identities, Formulas, and Equations; Applications of Trigonometry; Polar Equations, Complex Numbers, and Vectors; Conic Sections and Parametric Equations; Systems of Equations and Inequalities; Matrices; Sequences and Series; Counting and Probability; Degree, Minute, Second Form and Degree Decimal Form; Conic Section Proofs  MARKET:  For all readers interested in algebra and trigonometry.

DELMAR AUTOMOTIVE TRAINING ONLINE - DIAGNOSTIC SCENARIOS (DATO) creates a rich-media learning experience and challenges learners to master diagnostic and repair practices in 62 realistic scenarios that span all systems areas. Combining sound instructional design with top-quality photographs and videos, as well as necessary manufacturer information, learners develop critical thinking skills and apply them to real-world customer concerns. Each scenario addresses a simulated problem on a specific vehicle and teaches students to use a structured 8-step diagnostic process that starts with a customer-stated concern on a repair order and ends with repair verification. In keeping with ASE Education Foundation requirements, DATO's Learning Management System capabilities track, record and report each learner's progress.

ALERT: Before you purchase, check with your instructor or review your course syllabus to ensure that you select the correct ISBN. Several versions of Pearson's MyLab & Mastering products exist for each title, including customized versions for individual schools, and registrations are not transferable.

Packages  Access codes for Pearson's MyLab & Mastering products may not be included when purchasing or renting from companies other than Pearson; check with the seller before completing your purchase.  Used or rental books  If you rent or purchase a used book with an access code, the access code may have been redeemed previously and you may have to purchase a new access code.  Access codes  Access codes that are purchased from sellers other than Pearson carry a higher risk of being either the wrong ISBN or a previously redeemed code.

The first guide to planning and performing a physical penetration test on your computer's security Most IT security teams concentrate on keeping networks and systems safe from attacks from the outside-but what if your attacker was on the inside? While nearly all IT teams perform a variety of network and application penetration testing procedures, an audit and test of the physical location has not been as prevalent. IT teams are now increasingly requesting physical penetration tests, but there is little available in terms of training. The goal of the test is to demonstrate any deficiencies in operating procedures concerning physical security. Featuring a Foreword written by world-renowned hacker Kevin D. Mitnick and lead author of The Art of Intrusion and The Art of Deception, this book is the first guide to planning and performing a physical penetration test. Inside, IT security expert Wil Allsopp guides you through the entire process from gathering intelligence, getting inside, dealing with threats, staying hidden (often in plain sight), and getting access to networks and data.  Teaches IT security teams how to break into their own facility in order to defend against such attacks, which is often overlooked by IT security teams but is of critical importance Deals with intelligence gathering, such as getting access building blueprints and satellite imagery, hacking security cameras, planting bugs, and eavesdropping on security channels Includes safeguards for consultants paid to probe facilities unbeknown to staff Covers preparing the report and presenting it to management  In order to defend data, you need to think like a thief-let Unauthorised Access show you how to get inside.

本進銷存管理系統是針對國內精品服飾業所設計，但仍適合其他行業的進銷存管理。其中較特別的是，對於精品服飾業者，每年都有所謂的換季大拍賣，供應商會將折數逐次降低(例如5折、4折、3折等)，遇此狀況時，您只要輸入品牌及調降的折數，庫存中所有該品牌的產品將自動依指定的折數調降。本書除了附上一完整的進銷存管理系統外，對於系統中的各程式都有完整的介紹，所以您還可以針對此系統依您的需要加以適度的調整及擴充。認識資料庫及資料庫管理系統資料表的結構及建立方法資料表中的記錄的新增、修改、刪除認識關聯式資料庫及資料表間關聯的建立表單的設計方法、由表單編輯資料資料的查詢、動態查詢各式報表的製作、加上合計欄位認識及使用巨集指令切換表單的製作與資料庫的加密進銷存管理系統操作及設計說明

DELMAR AUTOMOTIVE TRAINING ONLINE - DIAGNOSTIC SCENARIOS is a groundbreaking online training program that creates a rich-media learning experience for students by challenging them to learn approved diagnostic and repair practices in 62 realistic scenarios that span all systems areas. By combining strong pedagogy along with real-world experiences, students will improve critical thinking and problem-solving skills through this interactive program. Each scenario addresses a simulated problem on a specific vehicle and teaches students to use an 8-step diagnostic process leading to a successful repair while coaching them with tips. DATO puts students in the role of technicians employed by ""All Tech Automotive."" It employs Flash animations, a wide variety of interactive features and live-action video to create a simulated but realistic modern repair facility. Students use available tools and diagnostic equipment, animated instrument panels, and service information to diagnose and repair vehicles. This is same approach used by manufacturers to train their own technicians that has been adapted to the needs and expectations of student learners. DATO challenges students to solve real problems on real vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai. DATO minimizes on-screen reading and maximizes student engagement by requiring students to prove that they've done the critical thinking and problem-solving involved in problem diagnosis. DATO Diagnostic Scenarios System Requirements Intel Pentium II 450MHz or faster processor (or equivalent) 128MB of RAM Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows XP, Mac OSX 10.5, 10.6 Graphics adapter with Minimum 1024 x 768 display resolution, 32 bit depth Minimum Display Resolution 1024 x 768 Broadband Internet Connection Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, or Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x, Safari 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Popup blocking software disabled Flash Player 10.x Recommended: Local or Network Printer

 Beginning Algebra by Trigsted, Bodden, and Gallaher is the first online, completely ""clickable"" Beginning Algebra text to take full advantage of MyMathLab's features and benefits. Kirk Trigsted saw marked improvements in student learning when he started teaching with MyMathLab, but he noticed that most students started their assignments by going directly to the MyMathLab homework exercises without consulting their textbook. This inspired Kirk to write a true eText, built within MyMathLab, to create a dynamic, seamless learning experience that would better meet the needs and expectations of his students. Completely clickable and fully integrated--the Trigsted eText is designed for today's learners.  KEY TOPICS:  Review; Real Numbers and Algebraic Expressions; Linear Equations and Inequalities in One Variable; Graphs of Linear Equations and Inequalities in Two Variables; Systems of Linear Equations and Inequalities; Exponents and Polynomials; Factoring Polynomials; Rational Expressions and Equations; Radicals and Rational Exponents; Quadratic Equations; Relations and Functions; Mean, Median, Mode; Geometry Review MARKET:  For all readers interested in beginning algebra.

 Beginning & Intermediate Algebra by Trigsted, Bodden, and Gallaher is the first online, completely ""clickable"" Beginning & Intermediate Algebra text to take full advantage of MyMathLab's features and benefits. Kirk Trigsted saw marked improvements in student learning when he started teaching with MyMathLab, but he noticed that most students started their assignments by going directly to the MyMathLab homework exercises without consulting their textbook. This inspired Kirk to write a true eText, built within MyMathLab, to create a dynamic, seamless learning experience that would better meet the needs and expectations of his students. Completely clickable and fully integrated-the Trigsted eText is designed for today's learners.  KEY TOPICS:  Review; Real Numbers and Algebraic Expressions; Linear Equations and Inequalities in One Variable; Graphs of Linear Equations and Inequalities in Two Variables; Systems of Linear Equations and Inequalities; Exponents and Polynomials; Factoring Polynomials; Rational Expressions and Equations; Introduction to Functions; Radicals and Rational Exponents; Quadratic Equations and Functions; Circles; Exponential and Logarithmic Functions and Equations; Conic Sections; Sequences and Series  MARKET:  For all readers interested in beginning and intermediate algebra.

DELMAR AUTOMOTIVE TRAINING ONLINE - DIAGNOSTIC SCENARIOS is a groundbreaking online training program that creates a rich-media learning experience for students by challenging them to learn approved diagnostic and repair practices in 62 realistic scenarios that span all systems areas. By combining strong pedagogy along with real-world experiences, students will improve critical thinking and problem-solving skills through this interactive program. Each scenario addresses a simulated problem on a specific vehicle and teaches students to use an 8-step diagnostic process leading to a successful repair while coaching them with tips. DATO puts students in the role of technicians employed by ""All Tech Automotive."" It employs Flash animations, a wide variety of interactive features and live-action video to create a simulated but realistic modern repair facility. Students use available tools and diagnostic equipment, animated instrument panels, and service information to diagnose and repair vehicles. This is same approach used by manufacturers to train their own technicians that has been adapted to the needs and expectations of student learners. DATO challenges students to solve real problems on real vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai. DATO minimizes on-screen reading and maximizes student engagement by requiring students to prove that they've done the critical thinking and problem-solving involved in problem diagnosis. DATO Diagnostic Scenarios System Requirements Intel Pentium II 450MHz or faster processor (or equivalent) 128MB of RAM Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows XP, Mac OSX 10.5, 10.6 Graphics adapter with Minimum 1024 x 768 display resolution, 32 bit depth Minimum Display Resolution 1024 x 768 Broadband Internet Connection Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, or Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x, Safari 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Popup blocking software disabled Flash Player 10.x Recommended: Local or Network Printer

Compared to industrial-strength database products such as Microsoft's SQL Server, Access is a breeze to use. It runs on PCs rather than servers and is ideal for small- to mid-sized businesses and households. But Access is still intimidating to learn. It doesn't help that each new version crammed in yet another set of features; so many, in fact, that even the pros don't know where to find them all. Access 2007 breaks this pattern with some of the most dramatic changes users have seen since Office 95. Most obvious is the thoroughly redesigned user interface, with its tabbed toolbar (or ""Ribbon"") that makes features easy to locate and use. The features list also includes several long-awaited changes. One thing that hasn't improved is Microsoft's documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in Access 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help.Access 2007: The Missing Manual was written from the ground up for this redesigned application. You will learn how to design complete databases, maintain them, search for valuable nuggets of information, and build attractive forms for quick-and-easy data entry. You'll even delve into the black art of Access programming (including macros and Visual Basic), and pick up valuable tricks and techniques to automate common tasks -- even if you've never touched a line of code before. You will also learn all about the new prebuilt databases you can customize to fit your needs, and how the new complex data feature will simplify your life. With plenty of downloadable examples, this objective and witty book will turn an Access neophyte into a true master.

This fast-paced book teaches you the basics of Access 2007 so you can start using this popular database program right away. You'll learn how to work with Access' most useful features to design databases, maintain them, search for valuable nuggets of information, and build attractive forms for quick-and-easy data entry.  The new Access is radically different from previous versions, but with this book, you'll breeze through the new interface and its timesaving features in no time with:  Clear explanations Step-by-step instructions Lots of illustrations Larger type Plenty of friendly advice  Ideal for small businesses and households, Access runs on PCs and manages large stores information, including numbers, pages of text, and pictures -- everything from a list of family phone numbers to an enormous product catalog. Unfortunately, each new version of the program crammed in yet another set of features -- so many that even the pros don't know where to find them all. Access 2007 breaks the mold: Microsoft changed the user interface by designing a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate. One thing that hasn't improved is Microsoft's documentation. Even if you find the features you need, you still may not know what to do with them. Access 2007 for Starters: The Missing Manual is the perfect primer for small businesses with no techie to turn to, as well as those who want to organize household and office information.

In a corporate setting, the Microsoft Office Suite is an invaluable set of applications. One of Offices' biggest advantages is that its applications can work together to share information, produce reports, and so on. The problem is, there isn't much documentation on their cross-usage. Until now.  Introducing Integrating Excel and Access, the unique reference that shows you how to combine the strengths of Microsoft Excel with those of Microsoft Access. In particular, the book explains how the powerful analysis tools of Excel can work in concert with the structured storage and more powerful querying of Access. The results that these two applications can produce together are virtually impossible to achieve with one program separately.   But the book isn't just limited to Excel and Access. There's also a chapter on SQL Server, as well as one dedicated to integrating with other Microsoft Office applications. In no time, you'll discover how to: Utilize the built in features of Access and Excel to access data Use VBA within Access or Excel to access data Build connection strings using ADO and DAO Automate Excel reports including formatting, functions, and page setup Write complex functions and queries with VBA Write simple and advanced queries with the Access GUI Produce pivot tables and charts with your data With Integrating Excel and Access, you can crunch and visualize data like never before. It's the ideal guide for anyone who uses Microsoft Office to handle data.

Microsoft Access is a large, intimidating program. Unlike Word or Excel where users can perform basic tasks without much in the way of training, Access presents challenges from the outset. Most users never progress beyond creating simple tables and using Wizards to create basic forms and reports. At the same time, all users - from managers to researchers to administrative assistants - need to know that what they seek is embedded somewhere in their Access tables. Without a more sophisticated knowledge of how to extract and present that data, they are forced to rely on office gurus and overworked IT people to provide canned reports or one-size-fits-all solutions. This book will change all that by giving readers the skills required to extract the data they need (queries), build efficient front-ends for that data (forms), and publish the results in an attractive and easy-to-read format (reports). To that end, this book shuns the big Access picture and instead focuses intently on queries, forms, and reports. This in-depth approach will give the reader the skills and understanding he or she needs to get at the data and prove the old adage that knowledge is indeed power.

Maybe you got Access as part of Microsoft Office and wonder what it can do for you and your household; maybe you're a small business manager and don't have a techie on staff to train the office in Microsoft Access. Regardless, you want to quickly get your feet wet--but not get in over your head--and Access 2003 for Starters: The Missing Manual is the book to make it happen.Far more than a skimpy introduction but much less daunting than a weighty tech book, Access 2003 for Starters: The Missing Manual demystifies databases and explains how to design and create them with ease. It delivers everything you need--and nothing you don't--to use Access right away. It's your expert guide to the Access features that are most vital and most useful, and it's your trusted advisor on the more in-depth features that are best saved for developers and programmers.Access is sophisticated and powerful enough for professional developers but easy and practical enough for everyday users like you. This Missing Manual explains all the major features of Access 2003, including designing and creating databases, organizing and filtering information, and generating effective forms and reports.Bestselling authors, database designers, and programmers Scott Palmer, Ph.D., and Kate Chase are your guides for putting the world's most popular desktop data management program to work. Their clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, plenty of illustrations, and timesaving advice help you get up to speed quickly and painlessly.Whether you're just starting out or you know you've been avoiding aspects of the program and missing out on much of what it can do, this friendly, witty book will gently immerse you in Microsoft Access. Keep it handy, as you'll undoubtedly refer to it again and again.

Contents Should we tell you the whole story? Of course, there is an inevitable tension in trying to work like this. For example, in Chapter 16 we talk about referential integrity. There are - sentially six different flavors of referential integrity but Access only s- ports four of them (they are the most important ones however, so you aren't missing out on too much). The problem is this. Should we tell you about the other two? If we do, as an Access user you have every right to be annoyed that we are telling you about a feature you can't use. On the other hand, the six different types that we describe are part of the re- tional world and this book is about that world - we are not trying to teach you how to use Access, we are simply using Access to illustrate the relational model. Ultimately we decided to risk your ire and to describe all of the features of the relational model as we see it, even if Access doesn't support all of them. One advantage of this approach is that if you need to use a different database engine you will almost certainly find the extra information useful. Incidentally, this is not meant to imply that Access is somehow lacking as a relational database engine. The reason we chose it for the first book is that it is such a good example of a relational database tool.

一般來言，將資料庫推向網路應用，最有效最普遍的方式是借助ASP。為了更具挑戰性，本書使用Java2。 目前資料庫的研發結果，可謂完整又方便，不僅僅是一個儲存資料的場所，且可執行篩選、排序、關聯、運算、甚至複雜的邏輯問題，有人說：『祗要您說得出，資料庫就可做得到』，雖然有點誇張，但筆者認為亦不遠矣。在眾多資料庫中，Access應屬最方便且功能不輸其他者，凡有Office的電腦，開機即可使用，無需再架server，無需另添購軟體，本書以其為範例資料庫。 通常架網站，我們都使用Window系統內建之IIS，而本書則使用servlet — jdsk2.1，是另一類Java網站架設系統，可令讀者眼界更寬更廣，更具挑戰，更有潛力。 當讀者閒逛書店，看到一本合味口的電腦書，內容精彩得不忍釋手，但還是卻步不買，原因非他，僅祗是不知使用何種軟體，或是搭配的軟價格太貴。有關Java2使用的軟體，均可於 “http://java.sun.com” 免費下載取得，本書自亦不例外。讀者可自行下載、或使用本書光碟C:\BookJavaAccess \System已備之系列軟體。 Java為物件導向程式語言，邏輯架構完整，功能強大，發展至今已成為佔有率最高，使用率最廣的程式語言。亦即凡研習電腦者不可不會的語言，唯門檻較高，令許多人望而卻步。若搭配筆者著：(1) Java2網路系統程式—松崗XP5117，(2) Java2網路3D繪圖程式設計—松崗XP5257，及本書(3) 資料庫網站系統應用。此三本書涵及網路、系統、3D繪圖、資料庫等各層面之Java應用，讀者可輕鬆切入，對Java作全面性有系統之認識。此外、本書對下列各點亦可提供有意義的協助。 1、您的工作、是每天坐在電腦前、輸入或印出公司的各類資料嗎？ 當系統功能不敷使用，您急著找原設計廠商，但不是找不到、就是要昂貴費用時！您可閱讀本書，迅速自己設計一個臨時系統，解決應急之問題。 2、您有閒暇逸緻、想輕鬆賺點外快嗎？ 您可閱讀本書，在短時間內，即可向商店、補習班、幼稚園、診所、餐廳、大樓管理等小型機構，包攬一些小型行政軟體。 3、您是老板、或是部門主管嗎？ 您閱讀本書後，當有廠商競標您公司行政系統電腦化軟體時！您將很清楚的了解底價在那裡，應設計有那些功能。 當員工提出要求或問題時！您將輕昜的了解他們的問題，並說出解決的方法。 4、您是高職、專科、大學的學生嗎？ 老師迫著您繳作業、繳專題，您不知如何是好時！您可研讀本書，不僅可幫助增進您的學業，也可幫您解決成績的問題。 5、您想自修更上一層樓嗎？ 當您閱讀本書後，包括生手在內、您對電腦應用之能力、都將大大的跨前一步。若再佐以上述筆者推薦之各書，更是不可限量，更具挑戰性。

本書使用大家都很熟悉的學校課程選修、成績計算、學分計算、成績查詢為主軸 (避開了商店、書店的管銷程序) 建立了一個ACCESS的資料庫；而且資料庫的建立是由「零」開始從無到有，讓你漸入佳境，由簡入繁 (避開了在學習的初期就讓你看一大堆的表單、資料表…)，並且讓你在不覺得困難的情況下已經進入了ACCESS VBA的程式操作，也相當程度的瞭解了ADODB、ADOX函式庫的運作，最後也有完全程式的系統封裝。即使在VBA程式的練習寫作中，也盡量避免大型程式的架構，所有的有效程式都是由小而大，逐步的偵錯、修改、演化、進階而來。 是故使你在學習VBA的過程中你一定會有收獲、有成就、有創意。

 Prealgebra by Trigsted, Gallaher, and Bodden is the first online, completely ""clickable"" prealgebra text to take full advantage of MyMathLab's features and benefits. Kirk Trigsted saw marked improvements in student learning when he started teaching with MyMathLab, but he noticed that most students started their assignments by going directly to the MyMathLab homework exercises without consulting their textbook. This inspired Kirk to write a true eText, built within MyMathLab, to create a dynamic, seamless learning experience that would better meet the needs and expectations of his students. Completely clickable and fully integrated-the Trigsted eText is designed for today's learners.  KEY TOPICS:  Whole Numbers; Integers and Introduction to Solving Equations; Solving Equations and Problem Solving; Fractions and Mixed Numbers; Decimals; Ratio, Proportion, and Triangle Applications; Percent; Graphing and Introduction to Statistics; Geometry and Measurement; Exponents and Polynomials; Tables; Quotient Rule and Negative Exponents; Scientific Notation; Geometric Formulas MARKET:  For all readers interested in prealgebra.

會計系統一詞，相信很多人都有相同的經驗，那就是花了大錢請專門人士為公司量身訂做，但往往要花費很多時間溝通整合，而且即使做出來的效果也不見令人滿意；或是在一個公司系統中，常常有多套系統並存在一起，例如進入進銷存系統要輸入一次帳號密碼、進入人事薪資系統時又要再輸入一次帳號密碼等情形，而每套系統幾乎都是以傳統DOS介面呈現方式，不但上手困難，同時也容易造成與其他系統不相容的情況。

DELMAR AUTOMOTIVE TRAINING ONLINE - DIAGNOSTIC SCENARIOS is a groundbreaking online training program that creates a rich-media learning experience for students by challenging them to learn approved diagnostic and repair practices in 62 realistic scenarios that span all systems areas. By combining strong pedagogy along with real-world experiences, students will improve critical thinking and problem-solving skills through this interactive program. Each scenario addresses a simulated problem on a specific vehicle and teaches students to use an 8-step diagnostic process leading to a successful repair while coaching them with tips. DATO puts students in the role of technicians employed by ""All Tech Automotive."" It employs Flash animations, a wide variety of interactive features and live-action video to create a simulated but realistic modern repair facility. Students use available tools and diagnostic equipment, animated instrument panels, and service information to diagnose and repair vehicles. This is same approach used by manufacturers to train their own technicians that has been adapted to the needs and expectations of student learners. DATO challenges students to solve real problems on real vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai. DATO minimizes on-screen reading and maximizes student engagement by requiring students to prove that they've done the critical thinking and problem-solving involved in problem diagnosis. DATO Diagnostic Scenarios System Requirements Intel Pentium II 450MHz or faster processor (or equivalent) 128MB of RAM Microsoft Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows XP, Mac OSX 10.5, 10.6 Graphics adapter with Minimum 1024 x 768 display resolution, 32 bit depth Minimum Display Resolution 1024 x 768 Broadband Internet Connection Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, or Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x, Safari 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Popup blocking software disabled Flash Player 10.x Recommended: Local or Network Printer

Access 2000
　Access 是一個用來做資料管理的套裝軟體。所謂「資料庫」通常是生活上一些相關資料的集合，而資料庫管理系統就是用來管理這些資料的套裝軟體。

　資訊界所講的「資料庫管理系統」，通常是指某一種具有資料管理能力的軟體，這種軟體應該要能提供使用者某些特定的資料管理的功能，並要在增刪修改資料時能幫使用者對資料作某種程度的檢查，避免資料的重複，並提高資料的正確性。

　資料庫管理系統所應提供的功能，在學術上早就制定了一套標準，以供業者在設計這類系統及消費者購買時參考。

本書將直接使用Microsoft Access 2002來引導您建立資料庫，並且使您從完全不了解Access資料庫─或者只知道一點點─到成為資料庫專家，使您可以開發資料庫應用程式給個人或更多的人使用。
本書將介紹了資料庫的觀念，並且說明了一些關於Access的基本概念，然後帶領您來一趟資料庫之旅，而這一趟資料庫之旅是以一個供應與種植園藝的虛擬公司─Garden公司為基礎（本書從頭到尾將使用這個資料庫為範例）。雖然看著別人做或許沒有自己親自建立自己所要的資料庫刺激，但在這一趟的行程下來，我們將使您建立穩固的基礎，並學會使用Access來建立您自己所擁有的資料庫。

本書重點

瞭解Access 2002新增與改良的功能，如資料頁設計檢視、資料庫網頁、整合樞紐分析表功能等
使用表單來簡化資料的輸入，並且加入控制項和VBA程式碼來協助資料的輸入
使用資料類型和欄位屬性來限制資料的輸入，從資料表中更新與刪除資料
建立切換表單、閃動畫面、與設定啟動選項，讓別人可以輕鬆使用您的資料庫
建立和維護多人使用的資料庫工作群組，對資料庫加密與解密
利用VBA程式碼建立靜態網頁，建立動態網頁以便在網路上編輯資料

資料庫實例應用
　Microsoft Accessg是 Micrpsoft Office 家族中專司「資料庫管理」的成員。它不但具備完整的資料庫處理能力，更擁有相當親切易懂的操作介面。只可惜自從正式推出之後，也不知什麼原因，始終備受冷落，相較於 Word、 Excel等成員「冠蓋滿京華」的風光景象， Access可畏「斯人獨憔悴」。

　但是近年來或許是文書處理、試算表等的學習環境已日趨成熟。大家也因此有較多的時間與精神來注意到 Access 這個處理資料庫的神奇寶貝了。因此從現在開始學好Access 時間點可謂「恰好」。

　本書以 Access 2000為基礎，以「會計總帳」為範例，希望透過 Step by Step 的方式讓你用 Access 2000 的各項功能來完成一個完整的會計總帳系統。換句話說，讀完本書並且熟悉各個操作步驟，你就是 Access 2000 資料庫的設計高手了。

馬上學會ACCESS 2000
　ACCESS 或許大家都知道它是一種資料庫的管理工具，但大多數的愛用者通常用Word或Excel來替代ACCESS做為資料儲存或處理的動作，看到ACCESS總是一籌莫展，有著一種隔著紗窗的朦朧與神秘之感，想要靠近卻又不知其門而入。

　ACCESS資料庫是由七大物件所組成：資料表、查詢、表單、報單、資料頁、巨集與模組。這七種物件又以資料表為主要，結合這些功能將使得資料庫的功能得以完全發揮，只要完成資料庫，讀者便可以向它予取予求。在ACCESS中，一個資料庫是許多資料表所組成，一個資料表是由每一列的記錄和每一行的欄位所組合成的。

有序工作
　你一定有過這樣的經驗：

　常常覺得各個檔案夾裡龐大繁雜的資料快把你淹沒了，你的老闆今天要你拿出某一產品或客戶最新的資料，明天換成產品與產品、客戶與客戶間的各種比較，光花在畫表格和填數字的時間就耗掉半天。或者你有幾百個學生，每到期終考終了，就必須為統計每個學生的作業、大考、小考、紀錄，以及成績排名等問題弄得暈頭轉向。

　多數人對微軟的Ｗｏｒｄ、Ｅｘｃｅｌ都不覺得陌生，但卻不知道在處理龐大檔案時，使用Ａｃｃｅｓｓ可以發揮出令其他軟體望塵莫及的功能。因為只要你能在Ａｃｃｅｓｓ裡預先設定好資料與資料間的互動關係，輸入資料，這樣不論你想橫向分析或縱向比較，都可以得到令你滿意的答案。

　配合著簡單生動的教學，以及全彩的內頁，希望所有的讀者都能靠著這本書走向更輕鬆、更有效率的工作之路。輕鬆學會Ａｃｃｅｓｓ，正是時候！

Access 2000
　隨著電腦科技的發展，個人電腦也成為我們生活中的一部分，現在台灣電腦教學不但從小學就開始教導，而使用電腦的族群也從一小撮專業人士擴大到社會各個階層，加上電腦硬體價格的降低及使用上的親和力，也使每個人都能把電腦當作一項工具。

　當你熟練了文書處理及試算表後，一定會想把身邊的資訊等輸入到電腦中來統合管理，如果利用電腦的話，可以瞬間找到自己想要找的資料，這也是學會使用資料庫的好處之一。

　到目前為止，資料庫的相關書籍，對於非相關科系及初學者來說，還是太難了些，因此本書親切並徹底的以視覺化的方式來說明，以實例操作取代了冗長的說明文字，大大降低了你對學習資料庫上的困難。

　另一方面，Access 2000在操作上，也很親切的提供了視窗界面，讓已熟悉Office其他軟體的人，能夠很快的入門。加上你只要按照本書實例及操作步驟，不但可減少學習上摸索的時間，無形之中也提高你學習時的自信。

　本書構成上是利用通訊錄的例子，來說明Access的所有基本操作，並介紹如何逐次加上各種資訊構築成一個資料庫。同時也特別說明在構築時應該注意的事項，今後你也可輕鬆的使用在顧客管理、庫存管理或藏書管理上。
