Explore the world of augmented reality development with the latest features of Unity and step-by-step tutorial-style examples with easy-to-understand explanationsKey Features: Build functional and interactive augmented reality applications using the Unity 3D game engineLearn to use Unity's XR and AR components, including AR Foundation and other standard Unity featuresImplement common AR application user experiences needed to build engaging applicationsBook Description: Augmented reality applications allow people to interact meaningfully with the real world through digitally enhanced content.The book starts by helping you set up for AR development, installing the Unity 3D game engine, required packages, and other tools to develop for Android (ARCore) and/or iOS (ARKit) mobile devices. Then we jump right into the building and running AR scenes, learning about AR Foundation components, other Unity features, C# coding, troubleshooting, and testing. We create a framework for building AR applications that manages user interaction modes, user interface panels, and AR onboarding graphics that you will save as a template for reuse in other projects in this book. Using this framework, you will build multiple projects, starting with a virtual photo gallery that lets you place your favorite framed photos on your real-world walls, and interactively edit these virtual objects. Other projects include an educational image tracking app for exploring the solar system, and a fun selfie app to put masks and accessories on your face. The book provides practical advice and best practices that will have you up and running quickly.By the end of this AR book, you will be able to build your own AR applications, engaging your users in new and innovative ways.What You Will Learn: Discover Unity engine features for building AR applications and gamesGet up to speed with Unity AR Foundation components and the Unity APIBuild a variety of AR projects using best practices and important AR user experiencesUnderstand the core concepts of augmented reality technology and development for real-world projectsSet up your system for AR development and learn to improve your development workflowCreate an AR user framework with interaction modes and UI, saved as a template for new projectsWho this book is for: This augmented reality book is for game developers interested in adding AR capabilities to their games and apps. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of Unity development and C# programming, familiarity with 3D graphics, and experience in using existing AR applications. Beginner-level experience in developing mobile applications will be helpful to get the most out of this AR Unity book.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is the result of dysfunction of the androgen receptor causing a deficit in the action of these hormones in target organs. Mutations in the AR gene that codes for this receptor cause varying degrees of androgen receptor dysfunction which is subsequently expressed as a mismatch between phenotype and genotype. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the most common etiology of male pseudohermaphroditism. The objective of this work is to search for molecular abnormalities of the AR gene in 12 Tunisian patients with ASI and to study the clinical-genetic correlation in them. We looked for mutations in the AR gene by the direct sequencing method from PCR products. Complete genotype determination was possible in 5 of 12 patients studied. The sequencing made it possible to identify two new mutations not reported in the literature as well as three previously described mutations.

Gain an in-depth knowledge in immersive web development to create augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications inside web browsers using WebXR API, WebGL, Three.js, and A-Frame. This project-based book will provide the practice and portfolio content to make the most of what the futures of spatial computing and immersive technology have to offer.Beginning with technical analysis of how web browsers function, the book covers programming languages such as WebGL, JavaScript, and HTML, with an eye on a complete understanding of the WebXR lifecycle. You'll then explore how contemporary web browsers work at the code level and see how to set up a local development server and use it with the Visual Studio Code IDE to create 3D animation in the WebGL programming language. With a familiarity of the web-rendering pipeline in place, you'll venture on to WebGL abstractions such as the Three.js JavaScript library and Mozilla's A-Frame XR Framework, which use WebXR to create high-end visual effects. In the final projects of the book, you'll create an augmented reality web session for an Android phone device, and create a VR scene in A-Frame (built on Three.js) to demo essential components of the WebXR API pertaining to user positioning and interaction.Game engines have become common-place for the creation of mixed reality content. However, developers not interested in learning entirely new workflows may be better suited to work within a medium almost universally open to all--the web; AR and VR Using the WebXR API will show you the way.What You'll LearnMaster the creation of virtual reality and augmented reality features for web pagePrepare to work as an immersive web developer with a portfolio of projects in sought-after technologiesReview the fundamentals of writing shaders in WebGLExperience the unity between client, server, and cloud architecture as it applies to location-based ARWho This Book Is ForAspiring immersive web developers and developers already familiar with the fundamentals of web development who want to further explore topics such as spatial computing, computer vision, spatial anchors, and cloud-computing for multi-user social experiences.

Em v獺rias 獺reas tecnol籀gicas 矇 muito comum nos depararmos com a modelagem matem獺tica de fen繫menos do mundo real, isto 矇, a representa癟瓊o de tais fen繫menos por express繭es matem獺ticas.

Realizamos a modelagem unindo a representa癟瓊o do fen繫meno por uma equa癟瓊o diferencial parcial advectiva-difusiva com a teoria dos conjuntos fuzzy. A uni瓊o destas duas teorias proporcionou determinar qual 矇 a melhor localiza癟瓊o de um ""polo industrial"", dos cinco pontos estudados em setores de regionaliza癟瓊o diferentes da cidade de Uberl璽ndia. O livro de Jennifer e Rosana 矇 uma grande oportunidade para os cientistas que estudam fen繫menos do mundo real para conhecerem a Teoria dos Conjuntos Fuzzy, e perceberem a sua aplicabilidade.

Nas 繳ltimas d矇cadas as pessoas passaram a permanecer grande parte do dia em ambientes fechados com pouca ou nenhuma troca de ar com o ambiente externo, aumentando o uso de t矇cnicas de climatiza癟瓊o nos locais de trabalho e em resid礙ncias, criando condi癟繭es potencialmente prejudiciais ? sa繳de humana. As bibliotecas s瓊o ambientes de grande circula癟瓊o de pessoas e com enorme acervo de livros, com poucos estudos a cerca deste tema. Assim foi selecionada a biblioteca da Universidade Estadual de Maring獺 como ambiente deste estudo. Este presente trabalho teve como objetivo observar a qualidade do ar interno e relacionar os ambientes fechados com ventila癟瓊o natural e artificial por equipamentos de ar condicionado com a S穩ndrome dos Edif穩cios Doentes (SED) relacionando os poss穩veis sintomas apresentados pelos trabalhadores do local como alergias, irrita癟繭es e problemas respirat籀rios. A edifica癟瓊o estudada apresenta 獺rea de 13.298,03 m簡 dividido em subsolo, t矇rreo e dois pavimentos, o inferior faz uso tanto de ventila癟瓊o natural por janelas quanto por sistema de ar condicionado do tipo Split, o segundo pavimento 矇 dotado apenas de ventila癟瓊o natural por janelas.
