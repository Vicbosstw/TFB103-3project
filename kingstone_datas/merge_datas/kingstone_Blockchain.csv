It is known that trust is of the utmost importance in human interactions, and blockchain technology establishes a new type of foundation for financial and political confidence. This new kind of trust is based on cryptographic techniques and distributed in digital networks. In an uncertain world where it is difficult to tell what is real or fake, decentralized organizational networks may prove to be particularly competitive given that this new ""distributed trust"" endows them with an unusual functional autonomy, namely guaranteeing the authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity of the processed data. Besides the direct sharing of information enabled by blockchain, transactions can now also take place with newfound trust and ways to safely manage personal data. It is important to look at these implications, particularly in sectors such as business and healthcare. Political and Economic Implications of Blockchain Technology in Business and Healthcare provides relevant theoretical frameworks on the political and economic impact of blockchain technology, which is thought to be able to redesign human interactions concerning transactions. Specifically, it will give ideas, concepts, and instruments considered relevant to advance the knowledge about ""cryptoeconomics"" and decentralized governance. The chapters will also provide several insights on business applications of this digital innovation, particularly in the healthcare sector, and will explore the ethical impact of the new ""distributed trust"" paradigm resulting from the surge of such a disruptive technology. This book is essential for students and researchers in social and life sciences, professionals and policymakers working in the fields of public and business administration, healthcare workers and researchers, academicians, and students interested in blockchain technology and the political and economic impacts in the industry.

This book discusses the various open issues of blockchain technology, such as the efficiency of blockchain in different domains of digital cryptocurrency, smart contracts, smart education system, smart cities, cloud identity and access, safeguard to cybersecurity and health care. For the first time in human history, people across the world can trust each other and transact over a large peer-to-peer networks without any central authority. This proves that, trust can be built not only by centralized institution but also by protocols and cryptographic mechanisms. The potential and collaboration between organizations and individuals within peer networks make it possible to potentially move to a global collaborative network without centralization. Blockchain is a complex social, economic and technological phenomenon. This questions what the established terminologies of the modern world like currency, trust, economics and exchange would mean. To make any sense, one needs to realize how much insightful and potential it is in the context and the way it is technically developed.  Due to rapid changes in accessing the documents through online transactions and transferring the currency online, many previously used methods are proving insufficient and not secure to solve the problem which arises in the safe and hassle-free transaction.  Nowadays, the world changes rapidly, and a transition flow is also seen in Business Process Management (BPM). The traditional Business Process Management holds good establishment last one to two decades, but, the internal workflow confined in a single organization. They do not manage the workflow process and information across organizations. If they do so, again fall in the same trap as the control transfers to the third party that is centralized server and it leads to tampering the data, and single point of failure. To address these issues, this book highlights a number of unique problems and effective solutions that reflects the state-of-the art in blockchain Technology. This book explores new experiments and yields promising solutions to the current challenges of blockchain technology.  This book is intended for the researchers, academicians, faculties, scientists, blockchain specialists, business management and software industry professionals who will find it beneficial for their research work and set new ideas in the field of blockchain. This book caters research work in many fields of blockchain engineering, and it provides an in-depth knowledge of the fields covered.

Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2018 im Fachbereich Informatik - Wirtschaftsinformatik, Note: 2,0, Bayerische Julius-Maximilians-Universit瓣t W羹rzburg, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: In dieser Arbeit wird untersucht, ob und inwieweit die Blockchain und dessen Anwendung als alternatives Datenbanksystem nutzbar ist. Eine qualitative Analyse zwischen bestehenden, konventionellen Datenbanksystemen und einer Anwendung der Blockchain wird dabei durch eine Argumentenbilanz und einer Nutzwertanalyse stattfinden. Vor der Evaluation findet der Leser in Kapitel 2 und 3 die Grundlagen f羹r die Untersuchung. Systeme zur Verwaltung von Informationen haben sich seit der ersten Entwicklung von computergest羹tzten Datenbankmodellen in den 1960er Jahren stetig weiterentwickelt. Kontinuierliche Verbesserung von bestehenden Implementierungen, wie sie beispielsweise bei der Abfragesprache SQL1 geschehen ist, f羹hrten gemeinsam mit der steigenden Notwendigkeit der Datenverwaltung zu einer immer st瓣rkeren Kommerzialisierung in den 1970er und 1980er Jahren durch Unternehmen wie IBM und Oracle. Disruptive Innovationen, wie die Entstehung des Internets, f羹hrten zu gro?en Ver瓣nderungen im Bereich der Datenverwaltung. Performance und Skalierungsprobleme der alten Systeme durch die rasant ansteigende Datenmenge waren die Folge. Durch diese Ver瓣nderungen entstanden grundlegend neue Datenbanksysteme, aber auch konventionelle Datenbanksysteme adaptierten den Wandel. Grundlage f羹r die Entstehung des Internets war die Entwicklung einer neuen Technologie namens TCP/IP, welche ein Computernetzwerk wie das World Wide Web und damit fundamentale Ver瓣nderungen aufgrund von Digitalisierung erst m繹glich gemacht hat. Einen 瓣hnlichen fundamentalen Meilenstein in der Entwicklung von Datenbanksystemen legt m繹glicherweise die Blockchain-Technologie.

Blockchain is the latest wave of innovation that has begun redesigning industry, social and political relationships, and every other form of exchanging value. Once, this is not just a transition, it's a rapid trend already in action. As of this writing, over 40 top financial institutions and numerous different businesses across industries have begun investigating blockchain to minimize transaction costs, speed up transaction time, minimize fraud risk, and remove middleman or middleman services. Others are seeking to re-imagine existing programs and facilities and take them to a new level and create new forms of service offerings as well.In the book we'll cover blockchain in greater detail. When you are new to blockchain, you can proceed through the chapters in the order provided or select only those important to you. This chapter discusses what blockchain is all about, how it has developed, and its importance with certain applications and use cases in today's world. To be able to look further into blockchain, it gives you an external viewpoint.Backstory of Blockchain One of the first known digital innovations that laid the foundation for the Internet back in the 1970s was TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol). Before TCP / IP, it was the era of circuit switching that involved dedicated communication between two parties. TCP / IP built its packet switching architecture that was more transparent and peer-to-peer without the need to create a separate line between parties.By the early 1990s, when the Internet was made freely available through the World Wide Web (WWW), it was meant to be more transparent and peer-to-peer. This is because the free and decentralized TCP / IP was built on top. Once any new technology, particularly the innovative ones, enters the market, either it falls away on its own or it has such an effect that it becomes the accepted standard. Citizens responded to the WWW movement and took advantage in every way of the opportunities it had to bring. As a result, the World Wide Web was starting to form itself in a way that may not have been the exact way it was pictured. It could have been opener, more available, and peer-to-peer. In top of that, several new inventions and companies started to develop and it was what it is today- more organized. Little by little people become used to what technology provides. Whether an international transaction takes days to conclude, whether it is too expensive, or it is not accurate, people are just fine.Let's look at the financial system more closely and its growth. There was no particular distinction between a contract and its settlement, because they were not two different bodies, beginning from the old days of the barter system to the fiat currencies. For instance, if Alice had to pay Bob $10, she would just give Bob a $10 note and the transaction would just get settled there. There was no need for a bank to debit $10 from Alice's account and add the same to Bob's account or function as a confidence mechanism to ensure Alice did not cheat Bob. Nevertheless, it was difficult to deal directly with someone who is not physically present near by. Therefore, banking systems developed with a lot more service offerings and transactions from every corner of the world were allowed. Geography was no longer a barrier with the aid of the Internet and banking was simpler than ever. In this way, not just banking: the Internet allowed several different kinds of web-based value exchange.

Block chain, mostly known as the backbone technology behind Bitcoin, is one of the hottest and most intriguing technologies currently in the market, but what exactly is it - and can it somehow help you? Simply put, Block Chain is the digital equivalent of a banker's ledger, one that records and secures transactions between two parties. Set to cyberspace, this type of programming allows the transfer not only of data, but of value - making it a unique and fundamental building block of our emerging future. Block chain technology was originally developed in 2009 to enable individuals and organizations to process transactions without the need for a central bank or other intermediary, using complex algorithms and consensus to verify transactions. Now it has been adopted and modified by companies and start-ups the world over, and is being closely scrutinized by World Banks as the logical next step in digital finance. This book explains Block Chain in its entirety; its history, uses, potential, disadvantages and even its future. Understanding this valuable, open system is vital to creating the financial freedom you crave. Digital currency is no longer a pipe dream of the basement gamer, its real, it's here, and you need to comprehend how it moves and is secured in order to plan for a future that will see a revolution in our current banking system.

Blockchain and machine learning technologies can mitigate healthcare issues such as slow access to medical data, poor system interoperability, lack of patient agency, and data quality and quantity for medical research. Blockchain technology facilitates and secures the storage of information in such a way that doctors can see a patient's entire medical history, but researchers see only statistical data instead of any personal information. Machine learning can make use of this data to notice patterns and give accurate predictions, providing more support for the patients and also in research related fields where there is a need for accurate data to predict credible results. This book examines the application of blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms in various healthcare settings, covering the basics of the technologies and exploring how they can be used to improve clinical outcomes and improving the patient's experience. These topics are illustrated with reference to issues around the supply chain, drug verification, reimbursement, control access and clinical trials. Case studies are given for applications in the analysis of breast cancer, hepatitis C, and COVID-19.

Many online applications, especially in the financial industries, are running on blockchain technologies in a decentralized manner, without the use of an authoritative entity or a trusted third party. Such systems are only secured by cryptographic protocols and a consensus mechanism. As blockchain-based solutions will continue to revolutionize online applications in a growing digital market in the future, one needs to identify the principal opportunities and potential risks. Hence, it is unavoidable to learn the mathematical and cryptographic procedures behind blockchain technology in order to understand how such systems work and where the weak points are. Cryptographic Primitives in Blockchain Technology provides an introduction to the mathematical and cryptographic concepts behind blockchain technologies and shows how they are applied in blockchain-based systems. This includes an introduction to the general blockchain technology approaches that are used to build the so-called immutable ledgers, which are based on cryptographic signature schemes.  As future quantum computers will break some of the current cryptographic primitive approaches, Andreas Bolfing considers their security and presents the current research results that estimate the impact on blockchain-based systems if some of the cryptographic primitive break. Based on the example of Bitcoin, he shows that weak cryptographic primitives pose a possible danger for the ledger, which can be overcome through the use of the so-called post-quantum cryptographic approaches.

Blockchain: Empowering Secure Data Sharing,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011372764?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Blockchain&pi=2,"Meng,Shen",Springer    ,9789811559389,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9389/9789811559389.jpg,"

With the development of big data, data sharing has become increasingly popular and important in optimizing resource allocation and improving information utilization. However, the expansion of data sharing means there is an urgent need to address the issue of the privacy protection - an area where the emerging blockchain technology offers considerable advantages. Although there are a large number of research papers on data sharing modeling and analysis of network security, there are few books dedicated to blockchain-based secure data sharing.Filing this gap in the literature, the book proposes a new data-sharing model based on the blockchain system, which is being increasingly used in medical and credit reporting contexts. It describes in detail various aspects of the model, including its role, transaction structure design, secure multi-party computing and homomorphic encryption services, and incentive mechanisms, and presents corresponding case studies. The book explains the security architecture model and the practice of building data sharing from the blockchain infrastructure, allowing readers to understand the importance of data sharing security based on the blockchain framework, as well as the threats to security and privacy. Further, by presenting specific data sharing case studies, it offers insights into solving data security sharing problems in more practical fields. The book is intended for readers with a basic understanding of the blockchain infrastructure, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, secure multiparty computing, homomorphic encryption and image retrieval technologies.

Die Digitalisierung kann innerhalb einer Organisation zu einer Konzentration auf das Kerngesch瓣ft f羹hren, sodass T瓣tigkeiten, die f羹r Kunden keinen direkten Mehrwert bedeuten, an kooperierende Organisationen (zum Beispiel externe Dienstleister) vergeben werden (Outtasking, Outsourcing). F羹r die kooperierenden Organisationen sind dann die Effizienz (Wirtschaftlichkeit) und die Rechtssicherheit wesentliche Aspekte, weshalb zur Koordination der Zusammenarbeit Workflow Management Systeme (WfMS) eingesetzt werden. In den verbundenen WfMS der kooperierenden Organisationen wird der Ablauf von T瓣tigkeiten definiert, verteilt und koordiniert, was als organisations羹bergreifender Workflow beziehungsweise synonym Cross-organizational Workflow (CoWf) zu bezeichnen ist. Eine weitere signifikante Effizienzsteigerung und Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit von CoWf in WfMS k繹nnte nun durch die Anwendung der Blockchain-Technologie in den Maschine-zu-Maschine-Schnittstellen (M2M-Schnittstellen) erreicht werden, mittels derer die WfMS der kooperierenden Organisationen verbunden sind.

YouVoter - A Secure e-voting System Using Blockchain Technology,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011455257?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Blockchain&pi=3,"Tharindu,de Zoysa",LAP Lambert Academic Publishing,9786200085795,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5795/9786200085795.jpg,"

Electronic voting (e-voting) is a symbol of modern democracy activities. Due to the high ballot privacy and verifiability, e-voting system has been booming in recent years. Existing electronic voting systems all suffer from a serious design flaw: They are centralized by design, meaning there is a single supplier that controls the code base, the database, and the system outputs while also supplying the monitoring tools to verify the result. The lack of an independently verifiable output makes it difficult for these centralized systems to acquire the trustworthiness required by voters, thus potentially limiting voter participation, or cast doubt upon the published output of an election. To provide an immutable, verifiable and secure online voting system we intend to leverage the availability of the Blockchain as a secure transaction database. From this public ledger, voters will be able to independently audit the inclusion of their vote, and the outcome of the election as a whole, while being sure that the results cannot be changed due to the immutability of the Blockchain.

Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Informatik - Internet, neue Technologien, Note: 1,0, FOM Essen, Hochschule f羹r Oekonomie & Management gemeinn羹tzige GmbH, Hochschulleitung Essen fr羹her Fachhochschule, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Der Wunsch des Menschens, Transaktionen ohne Intermedi瓣r durchzuf羹hren, ist nicht neu. Bereits im Jahr 1999 formulierte US-amerikanische Wirtschaftswissenschafter Milton Friedman die Idee von s.g. kryptografischen Transaktionssystemen. Mit der Entwicklung des Bitcoin und dessen rasanter Wertsteigerung wuchs auch das Interesse an der dazugeh繹rigen Technologie. Auch im Banksektor erhielt das Thema eine enorme Aufmerksamkeit. Schlie?lich stellten die digitalen W瓣hrungen deren Daseinsberechtigung in Frage. Aus dieser Not machte der Bankensektor jedoch eine Tugend und entdeckte die vielf瓣ltigen Einsatzm繹glichkeiten der Blockchain-Technologie f羹r sich. Dies spiegelt auch eine Umfrage des Bundesverbands Informationswirtschaft wieder. Dort gaben lediglich 6% der befragten Banken und Versicherungen an, dass die Blockchain-Technologie ihr aktuelles Gesch瓣ftsmodell bedroht. Vielmehr sieht der Sektor die Blockchain als eine M繹glichkeit der Effizienzsteigerung sowie Anpassung der Produkte und Dienstleistungen. Beim Schuldscheindarlehen (in der Folge SSD) kann diese Transformation gut beobachtet werden. Im Jahr 2017 platzierte die LBBW gemeinsam mit der Daimler AG das erste SSD 羹ber eine Blockchain. Diesem Trend folgten zuletzt immer mehr Banken, was die Zukunftsf瓣higkeit der Technologie - aber auch dieses Anwendungsbereichs - unterstreicht. Welche Chancen und Risiken sich aus solchen Transaktionen ergeben, ist bisher allerdings nur bedingt bekannt. Deshalb widmet sich die folgende Seminararbeit genau diesem Thema. Der Aufbau der Arbeit wurde in sechs Kapitel untergliedert. Drei der sechs Kapitel schlie?en mit einer Bewertung, die den Rahmen der Seminararbeit eingrenzen.

The first, foundational book on blockchain technology, from the bestselling author of Wikinomics Don Tapscott and blockchain expert Alex Tapscott, now in paperback with a new preface and chapter explaining recent developments in the world of blockchain, including cryptoassets, ICOs, smart contracts, and more. ""This book has had an enormous impact on the evolution of blockchain in the world."" --Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft Corporation In this revelatory book, Don and Alex Tapscott bring us a brilliantly researched, highly readable, and essential book about the technology driving the future of the economy.  Blockchain is the ingeniously simple, revolution­ary protocol that allows transactions to be simultaneously anonymous and secure by maintaining a tamperproof public ledger of value. Though it's best known as the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital cur­rencies, it also has the potential to go far beyond currency, to record virtually everything of value to humankind, from birth and death certifi­cates to insurance claims, land titles, and even votes. As with major paradigm shifts that preceded it, blockchain technology will create winners and losers. This book shines a light on where it can lead us in the next decade and beyond.

The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c807820387?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Blockchain&pi=4,"Werbach, Kevin",Mit Pr      ,9780262038935,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8935/9780262038935.jpg,"

How the blockchain--a system built on foundations of mutual mistrust--can become trustworthy.The blockchain entered the world on January 3, 2009, introducing an innovative new trust architecture: an environment in which users trust a system--for example, a shared ledger of information--without necessarily trusting any of its components. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is the most famous implementation of the blockchain, but hundreds of other companies have been founded and billions of dollars invested in similar applications since Bitcoin's launch. Some see the blockchain as offering more opportunities for criminal behavior than benefits to society. In this book, Kevin Werbach shows how a technology resting on foundations of mutual mistrust can become trustworthy. The blockchain, built on open software and decentralized foundations that allow anyone to participate, seems like a threat to any form of regulation. In fact, Werbach argues, law and the blockchain need each other. Blockchain systems that ignore law and governance are likely to fail, or to become outlaw technologies irrelevant to the mainstream economy. That, Werbach cautions, would be a tragic waste of potential. If, however, we recognize the blockchain as a kind of legal technology that shapes behavior in new ways, it can be harnessed to create tremendous business and social value.
