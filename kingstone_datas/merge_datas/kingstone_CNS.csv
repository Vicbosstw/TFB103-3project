Broadband networks, such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), frame relay, and leased lines, allow us to easily access multimedia services (data, voice, and video) in one package. Exploring why broadband networks are important in modern-day telecommunications, Introduction to Broadband Communication Systems covers the concepts and components of both standard and emerging broadband communication network systems. After introducing the fundamental concepts of broadband communication systems, the book discusses Internet-based networks, such as intranets and extranets. It then addresses the networking technologies of X.25 and frame relay, fiber channels, a synchronous optical network (SONET), a virtual private network (VPN), an integrated service digital network (ISDN), broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), and ATM. The authors also cover access networks, including digital subscriber lines (DSL), cable modems, and passive optical networks, as well as explore wireless networks, such as wireless data services, personal communications services (PCS), and satellite communications. The book concludes with chapters on network management, network security, and network testing, fault tolerance, and analysis. With up-to-date, detailed information on the state-of-the-art technology in broadband communication systems, this resource illustrates how some networks have the potential of eventually replacing traditional dial-up Internet. Requiring only a general knowledge of communication systems theory, the text is suitable for a one- or two-semester course for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in engineering as well as for short seminars on broadband communication systems.

This textbook provides a concise but lucid explanation of the fundamentals of spread-spectrum systems with an emphasis on theoretical principles. The choice of specific topics is tempered by the author's judgment of their practical significance and interest to both researchers and system designers. Throughout the book, learning is facilitated by many new or streamlined derivations of the classical theory. Problems at the end of each chapter are intended to assist readers in consolidating their knowledge and to provide practice in analytical techniques. This third edition includes new coverage of topics such as CDMA networks, Acquisition and Synchronization in DS-CDMA Cellular Networks, Hopsets for FH-CDMA Ad Hoc Networks, and Implications of Information Theory, as well as updated and revised material on Central Limit Theorem, Power Spectral Density of FH/CPM Complex Envelopes, and Anticipative Adaptive-Array Algorithm for Frequency-Hopping Systems.

Wavelength division multiplexed passive optical networks are perceived as the ultimate form of next-generation passive optical network that show promising outlooks in meeting the ever-growing demand of telecommunication capacities and internet traffic. In this book, an InAs/InP quantum dash laser is investigated as an ideal contender to meeting this demand owing to is broadband emission, which allows for expanding the utilizable bandwidth away from the over-exhausted C-band and to accommodating more subscribers for less capital expenditure. Firstly, the device is inspected as a tunable light source with a total emission-wavelength tuning range of 30 nm due to its inhomogeneous active region. Thereafter, the device is investigated in two-sectioned configurations to realize other monolithic devices. Lastly, the quantum dash active region is examined in terms of its electro-absorption (EA) and electro-optic (EO) characteristics. On another front, the quantum dash laser is employed to achieve the first demonstration of WDM transmission in the L-band over a single transmitter with an aggregate data rate of 384 Gbit/s with three simultaneous channels in DP-QPSK modulation scheme.
