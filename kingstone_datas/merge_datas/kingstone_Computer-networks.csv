Today, learning to use a computer is a must, because nowadays the computer is used in all aspects of everyday life.In addition, computers can make work easier and help to accomplish various tasks, at the same time, faster. Learning computers will certainly broaden the professional perspectives of learners, giving them the opportunity to perform their work more efficiently and with greater precision.In many ways, those who do not know how to manage this space of data, knowledge and communication will be in a situation of dependence similar to those who today cannot read, find their way around a map or fill in a form. To learn computer science is to learn how to live in the society (the world, the universe) of tomorrow.

Understand essential computer science concepts and skills. This book focuses on the foundational and fundamental concepts upon which expertise in specific areas can be developed, including computer architecture, programming language, algorithm and data structure, operating systems, computer networks, distributed systems, security, and more.According to code.org, there are 500,000 open programming positions available in the US-- compared to an annual crop of just 50,000 graduating computer science majors. The US Department of Labor predicted that there will be almost a million and a half computer science jobs in the very near future, but only enough programmers to fill roughly one third of these jobs. To bridge the gap, many people not formally trained in computer science are employed in programming jobs. Although they are able to start programming and coding quickly, it often takes them time to acquire the necessary understanding to gain the requisite skills to become an efficient computer engineer or advanced developer.  What You Will Learn The fundamentals of how a computer worksThe basics of computer programming and programming paradigmsHow to write efficient programsHow the hardware and software work together to provide a good user experience and enhance the usability of the systemHow computers can talk to each otherHow to ensure the security of the systemThe fundamentals of cloud offerings, implications/trade-offs, and deployment/adoption configurationsThe fundamentals of machine learningWho This Book Is For Computer programmers lacking a formal education in computer science, and anyone with a formal education in computer science, looking to develop a general understanding of computer science fundamentals

This monograph presents the challenges, vision and context to design smart learning objects (SLOs) through Computer Science (CS) education modelling and feature model transformations. It presents the latest research on the meta-programming-based generative learning objects (the latter with advanced features are treated as SLOs) and the use of educational robots in teaching CS topics. The introduced methodology includes the overall processes to develop SLO and smart educational environment (SEE) and integrates both into the real education setting to provide teaching in CS using constructivist and project-based approaches along with evaluation of pedagogic outcomes.Smart Learning Objects for Smart Education in Computer Science will appeal to researchers in CS education particularly those interested in using robots in teaching, course designers and educational software and tools developers. With research and exercise questions at the end of each chapter students studying CS related courses will find this work informative and valuable too.

""Havill's problem-driven approach introduces algorithmic concepts in context and motivates students with a wide range of interests and backgrounds."" -- Janet Davis, Associate Professor and Microsoft Chair of Computer Science, Whitman College　 ""This book looks really great and takes exactly the approach I think should be used for a CS 1 course. I think it really fills a need in the textbook landscape."" --　Marie desJardins, Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences, Simmons University ""Discovering Computer Science is a refreshing departure from introductory programming texts, offering students a much more sincere introduction to the breadth and complexity of this ever-growing field."" --　James　Deverick, Senior Lecturer, The College of William and Mary ""This unique introduction to the science of computing guides students through broad and universal approaches to problem solving in a variety of contexts and their ultimate implementation as computer programs."" --　Daniel Kaplan, DeWitt Wallace Professor, Macalester College Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming　is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience. Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students' prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities.　 The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component.　 Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features. The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses. This book contains 30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading.　 The accompanying website -- https: //www.discoveringcs.net -- includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.

I think it really fills a need in the textbook landscape."" -- Marie desJardins, Dean of the College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences, Simmons University Discovering Computer Science is a refreshing departure from introductory programming texts, offering students a much more sincere introduction to the breadth and complexity of this ever-growing field."" -- James Deverick, Senior Lecturer, The College of William and Mary ""This unique introduction to the science of computing guides students through broad and universal approaches to problem solving in a variety of contexts and their ultimate implementation as computer programs."" -- Daniel Kaplan, DeWitt Wallace Professor, Macalester College Discovering Computer Science: Interdisciplinary Problems, Principles, and Python Programming is a problem-oriented introduction to computational problem solving and programming in Python, appropriate for a first course for computer science majors, a more targeted disciplinary computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course for a general audience. Realizing that an organization around language features only resonates with a narrow audience, this textbook instead connects programming to students' prior interests using a range of authentic problems from the natural and social sciences and the digital humanities. The presentation begins with an introduction to the problem-solving process, contextualizing programming as an essential component. Then, as the book progresses, each chapter guides students through solutions to increasingly complex problems, using a spiral approach to introduce Python language features.  The text also places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, testing, and algorithmic techniques, offering glimpses of topics that are traditionally put off until later courses.  30 well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries, over 750 homework exercises, and 300 integrated reflection questions engage students in problem solving and active reading.  The accompanying website -- http: //DiscoverCS.denison.edu -- includes more advanced content, solutions to selected exercises, sample code and data files, and pointers for further exploration.

In recent years, graph theory and algorithms have received extensive attention from scholars of various disciplines. In the field of theoretical chemistry, atoms can be represented by vertices, and chemical bonds between atoms are represented by edges, so that the entire molecular structure is represented by a graph. Some basic properties of the compound are obtained by analysis of graph theory. This book gives some of the latest research results in graph theory and computer science.
