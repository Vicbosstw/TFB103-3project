The new culture of software development, explained by a 30-year industry veteran.Over the last decade, more and more companies have adopted a new approach to software development called DevOps. But few people seem to understand what DevOps is--or how they might fit into a DevOps environment.DevOps Overture answers these questions. It begins with an overview of what software development methodologies came before DevOps and of the problems associated with those systems. It then explains what DevOps is and how it works to address these problems. Finally, it offers advice to anyone who wants to position themselves for a career in DevOps and warns of common pitfalls to avoid.Maybe your company has adopted DevOps, and you need to adjust to an Agile culture. Or perhaps your company hasn't adopted DevOps, and you want to either advocate for the change or to position yourself to switch to a company that has. Or maybe you want to become conversant in DevOps practices. Either way, DevOps Overture is for you.Shawn D. Doyle is a founder and CEO of ReleaseTEAM, Inc., a DevOps Consulting Firm, established in 1999. After serving in the US Army and Desert Storm, he has amassed nearly 30 years of software delivery experience, having worked with companies from midsized to Fortune 100 to solve their business-critical challenges.

This practical guide brings DevOps principles to Salesforce development. It fits together two major movements within the IT world: the movement to Software/Platform as a Service (SaaS/PaaS), and the DevOps movement. While SaaS and PaaS allow companies to invest in their core competencies rather than maintain their own infrastructure, the goal of DevOps is to optimize the process of delivering software innovation and value. The release of Salesforce DX in late 2017 unlocks the possibility of a true DevOps workflow on Salesforce. But DevOps is new to the Salesforce world and there is not a widespread understanding of its goals and methods, and so adoption of Salesforce DX is still in the early stages. Mastering Salesforce DevOps explains how to build a powerful and comprehensive DevOps workflow for Salesforce--allowing you to finally deploy the world's most innovative platform using the world's most effective and efficient techniques. It addresses the need for a comprehensive guide to DevOps for Salesforce, allowing teams to bring proven practices from the IT world to resolve the hardest problems facing Salesforce developers today. What You Will LearnImprove company performance and software delivery performance using Salesforce DXTranslate DevOps concepts into the unique language and practices of SalesforceUnderstand why and how you can implement Salesforce DX to achieve greater productivity and innovationEnable continuous delivery on SalesforceBuild packages and architect code so it can be deployed easilyAllow admins to participate in what has traditionally been a developer workflowKnow the techniques for reducing the stress and risk of deploymentApply the full range of automated tests that can be used on Salesforce     Who This Book Is for Salesforce developers, release managers, and those managing Salesforce development teams who need a guide to DevOps, and DevOps specialists who need to apply familiar concepts to Salesforce

	敏捷開發一直是一個優良軟體團隊的最高指導原則，團隊軟體開發的SOP早已成形，大型企業無不使用Scrum作為標準。但知易行難，敏捷不同於一些經典軟體工程具有一套方法、流程和範本讓你可以去遵循和套用，它是由一系列實作方法組成，需要你根據實際場景和問題去選擇和應用，在自我實作的過程中不斷歸納和改進。

	本書以2008京奧的通訊產業為案例，以故事性的方式，把DevOps最精華的實作經驗完整描述。從Backlog、立會、Sprint基礎的開始，一直到燃盡圖、專案回顧等，小說般的情節，卻真正融入Scrum的技術理論。

	故事不止於此。在專案後續的動作上，持續整合(CI)是更重要的步驟。計劃撲克及精益軟體的追求，更是讓整個專案自動化的精神。另外在Docker、K8S的出現後、 DevOps的工作更是跨到了Operation。書中也提到DevSecOps的概念。

	這是一本融合理論、實踐以及故事情節的另類程式書，看起來是一部精彩的小說，實際上真的就是一個大型企業從頭到尾實踐Scrum的最成功案例。

This book is organized as an engineering reference guide for DevOps, presented in five parts as follows: Part I: What Is Engineering DevOps and Why Is It Important? is organized into three chapters. Chapter 1, ""What is Engineering DevOps?,"" explains engineering concepts and terms used in this book that have proven to work with many clients I have encountered during my consulting experiences. My depiction of a DevOps Engineering Blueprint is presented for as a useful, practical ""big-picture"" reference for discussing engineering the major parts of DevOps. Chapter 2, ""Nine Pillars of DevOps,"" describes a classification of DevOps practices that I have found to be useful characterization of DevOps engineering practices that can be readily applied when engineering DevOps implementations. Chapter 3, ""Why Is Engineering DevOps Important?,"" explains the benefits of taking an engineering approach to engineering DevOps. Part II: Engineering People, Processes and Technologies for DevOps provides a comprehensive explanation of recommended engineering practices for the higher levels of the DevOps Engineering Blueprint. DevOps transformations are not normally understood or applied using strict engineering principles. Engineering practices are presented in nine chapters as follows: ""How Should DevOps Be Engineered?"" includes a discussion of DevOps Engineering Maturity Levels for each of the Three Dimensions (People, Process, and Technology), Twenty-Seven DevOps Engineering Critical Success Factors, and Lean DevOps Value-Stream Pipeline Engineering. I describe recommended engineering practices for the top layers of the DevOps Engineering Blueprint in the next chapters, which include ""Value-Stream Management (VSM),"" ""Application Release Automation (ARA),"" ""Version Management,"" ""Continuous Security (a.k.a. DevSecOps),"" ""Service Catalog,"" ""Governance,"" ""Site Reliability Engineering (SRE),"" ""Disaster Mitigation,"" and ""Recovery."" Part III: Engineering Applications, Pipelines, and Infrastructures Engineered for DevOps provides a comprehensive explanation of recommended engineering practices for the lower levels of the DevOps Engineering Blueprint, presented in six chapters as follows: ""DevOps Applications Engineering,"" ""CI/CD Pipelines Engineering,"" ""Elastic Infrastructure Engineering,"" ""Continuous Test Engineering,"" ""Continuous Monitoring Engineering,"" and ""Continuous Delivery and Deployment Engineering.""Part IV: DevOps Seven-Step Transformation Engineering Blueprint provides a description and tools for my approach to realize and evolve DevOps. The seven steps are Visioning, Alignment, Assessment, Solution Engineering, Realization, Operationalize, and Expansion. By using these tools, DevOps leaders and practitioners can create, implement, operate, and expand their DevOps across the organization. The chapter goes further to explain how to evolve DevOps from a successful First Way DevOps (Continuous Flow) towards realizing more advanced Second Way (Continuous Feedback) and Third Way (Continuous Improvement) DevOps implementations. This part includes a discussion of ""Beyond Continuous Improvement""--a look at emerging technologies that are shaping DevOps in the future and how you can prepare your DevOps and yourself for the future. This part includes a discussion of how to set up an effective DevOps engineering training program that supports continuous learning of DevOps engineering skills needed to maintain and enhance DevOps.Part V: Appendices, Continuous Learning, and References includes materials and sources that I have found most useful for engineering DevOps.
