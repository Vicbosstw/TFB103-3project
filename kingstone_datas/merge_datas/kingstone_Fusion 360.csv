Flexibility, fragility, emergence of electronic puddles at deformation of graphene are associated with a movement of quantum structures.We used interpretation of quantum mechanics, based on statistical quantum ensembles, and obtained an equation and trajectory for these ensembles, that is, for quantum oscillator, electron orbits which explain reasonably some unusual properties of graphene. In magnetic field, a long-range ordering can be formed by electron structure, named as an united quantum oscillator(UQO), where the number of electrons is correlated with quantum number of oscillator, and the energy per one electron is less than energy of valence electron.This energy difference grows with number of these electrons (as if UQO ""attracts"" them).This could explain the high conductivity, disorder length scale, formation of clusters: electronic puddles, molecular bond, formation of even a relatively small nebula in space, or of different plasma instabilities which can be as the center of nucleosynthesis.Conditions to start of nucleosynthesis are discussed.Our results could be addressed to students, astrophysicists, experts in nuclear fusion, creators of nanomaterials with desired prop

This book is a primer on the interplay between plasma and materials in a fusion reactor, so-called plasma-materials interactions (PMIs), highlighting materials and their influence on plasma through PMI. It aims to demonstrate that a plasma-facing surface (PFS) responds actively to fusion plasma and that the clarifying nature of PFS is indispensable to understanding the influence of PFS on plasma. It describes the modern insight into PMI, namely, relevant feedback to plasma performance from plasma-facing material (PFM) on changes in a material surface by plasma power load by radiation and particles, contrary to a conventional view that unilateral influence from plasma on PFM is dominant in PMI. There are many books and reviews on PMI in the context of plasma physics, that is, how plasma or plasma confinement works in PMI. By contrast, this book features a materials aspect in PMI focusing on changes caused by heat and particle load from plasma: how PFMs are changed by plasma exposure and then, accordingly, how the changed PFM interacts with plasma.

Revision with unchanged content. Electromyographic (EMG) signal analysis is the process of resolving a composite EMG signal into its constituent motor unit potential trains (classes) and it can be configured as a classification problem. An EMG signal detected by the tip of an inserted needle electrode is the superposition of the indivi-dual electrical contributions of the different motor units that are active, during a muscle contraction, and background interference. This book addresses the process of EMG signal decomposition by developing an interactive classification system, which uses multiple classifier fusion techniques in order to achieve improved classification performance. The developed system combines heterogeneous sets of base classifier ensembles of different kinds and employs both a one level classifier fusion scheme and a hybrid classifier fusion approach. Performance of the developed system was evaluated using synthetic simulated signals of known properties and real signals and compared with the performance of the constituent base classifiers. This book is directed toward graduate students and researchers in the area of electromyography and professionals in electromyography clinics.

This practical guidebook describes the basic concepts, the mathematical developments, and the engineering methodologies for exploiting possibility theory for the computer-based design of an information fusion system where the goal is decision support for industries in smart ICT (information and communications technologies). This exploitation of possibility theory improves upon probability theory, complements Dempster-Shafer theory, and fills an important gap in this era of Big Data and Internet of Things.The book discusses fundamental possibilistic concepts: distribution, necessity measure, possibility measure, joint distribution, conditioning, distances, similarity measures, possibilistic decisions, fuzzy sets, fuzzy measures and integrals, and finally, the interrelated theories of uncertainty..uncertainty. These topics form an essential tour of the mathematical tools needed for the latter chapters of the book. These chapters present applications related to decision-making and pattern recognition schemes, and finally, a concluding chapter on the use of possibility theory in the overall challenging design of an information fusion system. This book will appeal to researchers and professionals in the field of information fusion and analytics, information and knowledge processing, smart ICT, and decision support systems.

On the Edge of Magnetic Fusion Devices,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200916204?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Fusion%20360&pi=1,"Sergei,Krasheninnikov",Springer    ,9783030495930.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5930/9783030495930.jpg,"

This book reviews the current state of understanding concerning edge plasma, which bridges hot fusion plasma, with a temperature of roughly one million degrees Kelvin with plasma-facing materials, which have melting points of only a few thousand degrees Kelvin. In a fact, edge plasma is one of the keys to solution for harnessing fusion energy in magnetic fusion devices.The physics governing the processes at work in the edge plasma involves classical and anomalous transport of multispecies plasma, neutral gas dynamics, atomic physics effects, radiation transport, plasma-material interactions, and even the transport of plasma species within the plasma-facing materials.The book starts with simple physical models, then moves on to rigorous theoretical considerations and state-of-the-art simulation tools that are capable of capturing the most important features of the edge plasma phenomena. The authors compare the conclusions arising from the theoretical and computational analysis with the available experimental data. They also discuss the remaining gaps in their models and make projections for phenomena related to edge plasma in magnetic fusion reactors.

In this thesis, the total fusion cross section sF, the fusion barrier distribution DF and the fusion probability PF, for the reactions 40Ca+44Ca, 40Ar+110Pd, 40Ca+194Pt, 46Ti+46Ti, 48Ti+60Ni, 48Ca+238U, 58Ni+54Fe, 58Ni+58Ni, 81Br+104Ru, 86kr+76Ge, 86kr+100Mo, 124Sn+96Zr, 132Sn+48Ca and 134Te+40Ca has been studied. The semiclassical approach employed in the present study is based on the theory of Alder andWinther (AW) which was originally proposed to treat the Coulomb excitation of nuclei which is called Continuum-Discretized Coupled Channels (CDCC) method. The semiclassical approach uses the Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin (WKB) approximation to treat the classical fusion probability, whereas that the intrinsic motion is handled as a time-dependent Quantum Mechanics. To sustain our semiclassical calculations and to test its success or shortfall, we had performed full quantum mechanical calculations using the well-known CCFULL code which is used to study the fusion reactions for heavy ions. The calculations for both semiclassical and full quantum mechanical have been performed in the case of no-coupling and in the case of coupling effect included.

We have seen a huge increase in the use and application of a tiny device called a sensor in a number of fields. A single network may consist of many tiny sensors that sense different or same types of data. All the data sensed may vary due to data inaccuracy, inconsistency, incorrectness and imperfect so a method should be developed to get the most accurate and correct result. Data fusion is the approach by which we can get the near correct results. In this work, I have simulated three methods and two algorithms to get the best posterior data. All the methods were simulated and the result shows how one can reduce error from sensed data of sensors and predict future data based on previous data considering types of error possible in an environment.

From security point of view, identity of a person is of critical importance. Increased threats to conventional security methods of personal identification has given rise to personal identification and verification systems based on biometrics. These systems establish human identity using individual's physical or behavioral attributes. These attributes besides being universal, unique and permanent need to be acceptable as well. One such biometric modality that has potential for further exploration is Ear. As a step in this direction, we have made an attempt to explore the potential of time series based Autoregressive (AR) modelling. Performance of AR model using ear biometrics motivated us to make an attempt for 100% RR of a person based on multimodal biometrics. After a study of state of art biometric modalities and potential of second order texture based methods having capability to extract information beyond visual perception, we found it reasonable to fuse AR based feature vector of Ear shape with second order texture based statistics of biometric modality Iris.

The complexities involved in programming industrial robot limits the applicability of the robotic system in a dynamic workspace. The earlier conventional robot programming methods are designed and developed for structured environments, which are unable to tackle the increasing flexibilities of the robotic systems. Moreover, using these conventional methods require highly skilled operators. A natural interface which provides opportunities to program a robot without the requirement of rigorous robot programming skill is Robot Programming by Demonstration (PbD). PbD is an approach programs a robot by simply demonstrating the desired tasks. The robot recognizes the task to be performed and learns how to perform it by imitating the demonstrator. In this book, a multisensor fusion approach to teaching robot through demonstrations is presented.

In the framework of the rigorous fusion of GNSS and InSAR observations, the presented work carries out at a straightforward comparison of the wet delay, caused by water vapor, derived from GNSS and InSAR. The contributions of the two sensors to the wet delay are compared in the line of sight towards the SAR satellite. Comparisons of GNSS observations with the satellite-directed InSAR data show that only a partial component of the wet delay remains after the interferogram formation.

This Book is focused on the combination of multiple biometric trait for person authentication in what called as multimodal biometric system. In this book, multimodal biometric system integrating face and ear at feature level is proposed. Feature Extraction is done by PCA and FLD. Multimodal biometric systems elegantly address several of the problems present in unimodal systems. By combining multiple sources of information, these systems improve matching performance, increase population coverage, deter spoofing, and facilitate indexing. Various fusion levels and scenarios are possible in multimodal systems. Incorporating user-specific parameters can further improve performance of these systems

Since the beginning of time, Man, by nature, has sought safety and well being for both himself and his kin. This instinct has obviously led him to develop an inquisitive, questioning disposition. He seeks information about his environs, but his cautious mind also demands reassurance that the data he receives is accurate, timely and not fraudulent or misleading. In striving to make modern pervasive technology systems as useful and as secure as possible, researchers aim to develop systems that can rely on similar guarantees. Ubiquitous computing is growing and emerging as an increasingly significant part of our everyday lives. Context awareness will play a substantial role in achieving this. Location is a major part of context but many factors have contrived to prevent the widespread deployment of location-aware technologies outside of a few niche areas. A Redundant Positioning Architecture will go a long way to combating the drawbacks that currently inhibit pervasive usage and this research endeavour aims to evaluate data fusion techniques which might be applicable for deployment within such a framework.

 This new edition presents the essential theoretical and analytical methods needed to understand the recent fusion research of tokamak and alternate approaches. The author describes magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic theories of cold and hot plasmas in detail. The book covers new important topics for fusion studies such as plasma transport by drift turbulence, which depend on the magnetic configuration and zonal flows. These are universal phenomena of microturbulence. They can modify the onset criterion for turbulent transport, instabilities driven by energetic particles as well as alpha particle generation and typical plasma models for computer simulation. The fusion research of tokamaks with various new versions of H modes are explained. The design concept of ITER, the international tokamak experimental reactor, is described for inductively driven operations as well as steady-state operations using non-inductive drives. Alternative approaches of reversed-field pinch and its relaxation process, stellator including quasi-symmetric system, open-end system of tandem mirror and inertial confinement are also explained. Newly added and updated topics in this second edition include zonal flows, various versions of H modes, and steady-state operations of tokamak, the design concept of ITER, the relaxation process of RFP, quasi-symmetric stellator, and tandem mirror. The book addresses graduate students and researchers in the field of controlled fusion.

In the last few years the scientific community has realized that obtaining a better understanding of interactions between natural systems and the man-made environment across different scales demands more research efforts in remote sensing. An integrated Earth system observatory that merges surface-based, air-borne, space-borne, and even underground sensors with comprehensive and predictive capabilities indicates promise for revolutionizing the study of global water, energy, and carbon cycles as well as land use and land cover changes. The aim of this book is to present a suite of relevant concepts, tools, and methods of integrated multisensor data fusion and machine learning technologies to promote environmental sustainability. The process of machine learning for intelligent feature extraction consists of regular, deep, and fast learning algorithms. The niche for integrating data fusion and machine learning for remote sensing rests upon the creation of a new scientific architecture in remote sensing science that is designed to support numerical as well as symbolic feature extraction managed by several cognitively oriented machine learning tasks at finer scales. By grouping a suite of satellites with similar nature in platform design, data merging may come to help for cloudy pixel reconstruction over the space domain or concatenation of time series images over the time domain, or even both simultaneously. Organized in 5 parts, from Fundamental Principles of Remote Sensing; Feature Extraction for Remote Sensing; Image and Data Fusion for Remote Sensing; Integrated Data Merging, Data Reconstruction, Data Fusion, and Machine Learning; to Remote Sensing for Environmental Decision Analysis, the book will be a useful reference for graduate students, academic scholars, and working professionals who are involved in the study of Earth systems and the environment for a sustainable future.

Iter - the Giant Fusion Reactor,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c911440400?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Fusion%20360&pi=2,"Claessens, Michel",Copernicus Books,9783030275808.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5808/9783030275808.jpg,"

This book provides for the first time an insider's view into ITER, the biggest fusion reactor in the world, which is currently being constructed in southern France.Aimed at bringing the ""energy of the stars"" to earth, ITER is funded by the major economic powers (China, the EU, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US). Often presented as a ""nuclear but green"" energy source, fusion could play an important role in the future electricity supply. But as delays accumulate and budgets continue to grow, ITER is currently a star partially obscured by clouds. Will ITER save humanity by providing a clean, safe and limitless source of energy, or is it merely a political showcase of cutting-edge technology? Is ITER merely an ambitious research project and partly a PR initiative driven by some politically connected scientists? In any case, ITER has already helped spur on rival projects in the US, Canada and the UK. This book offers readers a behind-the-scenes look at this controversial project, which France snatched from Japan, and introduces them to a world of superlatives: with the largest magnets in the world, the biggest cryogenic plant and tremendous computing power, ITER is one of the most fascinating, and most international, scientific and technological endeavours of our time.

The pursuit of nuclear fusion as an energy source requires a broad knowledge of several disciplines. These include plasma physics, atomic physics, electromagnetics, materials science, computational modeling, superconducting magnet technology, accelerators, lasers, and health physics. Nuclear Fusion distills and combines these disparate subjects to create a concise and coherent foundation to both fusion science and technology. It examines all aspects of physics and technology underlying the major magnetic and inertial confinement approaches to developing nuclear fusion energy. It further chronicles latest developments in the field, and reflects the multi-faceted nature of fusion research, preparing advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics and engineering to launch into successful and diverse fusion-related research. Nuclear Fusion reflects Dr. Morse's research in both magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, working with the world's top laboratories, and embodies his extensive thirty-five year career in teaching three courses in fusion plasma physics and fusion technology at University of California, Berkeley.

With Anatomy 360, you'll get a complete picture of every part of your body--from your head to your toes, inside and out, and from every angle. Our bodies are a mystery to us. We see our arms and legs move, but may have no idea how the muscles beneath look as they contract. We know that our stomachs digest food and our hearts pump blood, but the images we have in our heads of these organs are often inaccurate or incomplete. Even seeing pictures of our internal systems and organs can be misleading if these pictures don't offer a full, 360-degree view. This new flexibound edition of Anatomy 360 shows the human body in its entirety--from the skin to the muscles to the organs to the bones. This stunning book provides a unique perspective on our most crucial parts, showing how the structures of our bodies influence their functions. You'll learn about the vagus nerve, which allows us to swallow, speak, and cough, and the frontalis muscle, which raises our eyebrows when we're surprised. You'll also learn why our noses run when we cry and why our brains are so important even though they weigh just one kilogram each. With Anatomy 360, you'll finally get a complete look at the human body--even the parts you thought you'd never see! The hardcover edition of Anatomy 360 won the Gold Award in Reference from ForeWord's 2011 Book of the Year Awards

At eleven, his grandmother's cancer diagnosis inspired him to investigate new ways to produce medical isotopes. And by fourteen, Wilson had built a 500-million-degree reactor and become the youngest person in history to achieve nuclear fusion. How could someone so young achieve so much, and what can Wilson's story teach parents and teachers about how to support high-achieving kids?

Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change by Martin Silberberg and Patricia Amateis has been recognized in the general chemistry market as an unparalleled classic. The revision for the eighth edition focused on continued optimization of the text. To aid in this process, we were able to use data from literally thousands of student responses to questions in LearnSmart, the adaptive learning system that assesses student knowledge of course content. The data, such as average time spent answering each question and the percentage of students who correctly answered the question on the first attempt, revealed the learning objectives that students found particularly difficult, which we addressed by revising surrounding text or adding additional learning resources such as videos and slideshows. The text still contains unprecedented macroscopic-to-microscopic molecular illustrations, consistent step-by-step worked exercises in every chapter, and an extensive range of end-of-chapter problems, which provide engaging applications covering a wide variety of interests, including engineering, medicine, materials, and environmental studies. Changes have been made to the text and applications throughout to make them more succinct, to the artwork to make it more teachable and modern, and to the design to make it more simplistic and open.

The Miller/O'Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Beginning Algebra 4e. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognize which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.
