A Story of Big Tech Censorship and Bias and the Fight to Save Our Country  The madness of Big Tech and their attempt to mold our reality into a version compatible with their globalist view of the world has never been portrayed better than in this chilling account by Google whistleblower, Zach Vorhies. As a senior engineer at Google for many years, Zach was aware of their bias, but watched in horror as the 2016 election of Donald Trump seemed to drive them into dangerous territory. The American ideal of an honest, hard-fought battle of ideas--when the contest is over, shaking hands and working together to solve problems--was replaced by a different, darker ethic alien to this country's history.  Working with New York Times bestselling author Kent Heckenlively (Plague of Corruption), Vorhies and Heckenlively weave a tale of a tech industry once beloved by its central figure for its innovation and original thinking, turned into a terrifying intellectual wasteland of brutality and censorship. For Zach, an intuitive counter-thinker, brought up on the dystopian futures of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Ray Bradbury, it was clear that Google was attempting nothing less than a seamless rewriting of the operating code of reality in which many would not be allowed to participate.  Using Google's own internal search engine, Zach discovered their six-part plan for complete information dominance and released 950 pages of these documents to the world in June 2019 with an appearance with James O'Keefe on Project Veritas, which quickly became one of their most popular stories.  From the globalist enclaves of Silicon Valley in 2016 in the wake of the Trump victory to the November 3, 2020 election, Zach provides a ""you are there"" perspective on these events and where we may be headed as a country. Read this book if you care about the future of America.

Many companies claim to have gone to the cloud, yet returns from their efforts are meager or worse. Why? Because they've defined cloud as a destination, not a capability. Using cloud as a single-vendor, one-stop destination is fiction; in practice, today's organizations use a mosaic of capabilities across several vendors. Your cloud strategy needs to follow a hybrid multicloud model, one that delivers cloud's value at destinations you choose.This practical guide provides business leaders and C-level executives with guidance and insights across a wide range of cloud-related topics, such as distributed cloud, microservices, and other open source solutions for strengthening operations. You'll apply in-the-field best practices and lessons learned as you define your hybrid cloud strategy and drive your company's transformation strategy.Learn cloud fundamentals and patterns, including basic concepts and historyGet a framework for cloud acumen phases to value-plot your cloud futureKnow which questions to ask a cloud provider before you signDiscover potential pitfalls for everything from the true cost of a cloud solution to adopting open source the right way

Faced with the 'globalisation of violence' against humans and the wider Earth community, a key question of our time is: Where can humanity turn for inspiration? Voices in international law, the UN system, labour and social movements, intellectual circles, religious and ethical traditions are calling for a shift from 'Just War' to 'Just Peace'. At the heart of this book is a wider call, for a 'Just and Ecologically Sustainable Peace'. This book reflects the conviction that the arts, literature, activism and scholarly research can together contribute to the kinds of cultural shift requisite for a peace that flows from and extends to human relations with the natural world. Six artworks by peace artist William Kelly and five commissioned poems in response to those works, form the framework of the book. Interspersed with poems are creative prose and short thematic essays (of 1000-1200 words) from selected Indigenous, ecological, feminist and religious scholars and activists.

Cloud technology seems to be the business driver of the last few years. According to several studies, international corporations as well as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are looking to move their information technology to the cloud. Expectations are high and briefly summarised: Low costs for the use of information technology, flexible use and invoicing, always technologically up to date, high availability, high agility, no commitment of own resources, no responsibility for operation and maintenance. But what about governance compliance, responsibility towards information security and data protection? How is the cloud technology integrated into the company in compliance with laws, regulations and specifications, what responsibility does the management have, how are processes to be adapted, what effects arise for the company, what are the risks? Will changes occur in the company, what needs to be adapted? How are data protection laws complied with and how is information security? And how does the company protect itself against data theft, manipulation, destruction and possibly espionage? Cloud Security Basics in the updated 2nd edition shows which measures are necessary to be able to use cloud technology securely. After discussing the cloud technology with its architecture and the different objects that are available, the book describes the necessary organisational and technical measures to achieve security. It looks at governance, compliance, risk management, information security management and specifically addresses the situation of data protection. Finally, the book provides recommendations on which measures should be implemented.

Nowadays, data security is playing a significant role in the communication system as the hackers between transmissions media are more. The level of security depends on the secret key according to the work, the security level is more for the key size of higher bits and also larger data size becomes a major challenge task for further process. Therefore, the generation of a key with more size is a major challenging task. At present, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a better cryptography system where the encryption and decryption can perform with a secure key. The literature says the holomorphic function is well suitable for data size reduction. To address this issue, novel Holomorphic based encryption and decryption and AES are combined to increase the security level. The second novelty is the variable key generation using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) due to its enlarged proportion of consideration in industry and researchers. Point addition and Point doubling are employed for ECC to produce 256 values and multiplication operations can be avoided. After the generation of a matrix, each matrix value is encrypted and decrypted using a Holomorphic algorithm.

Cloud computing describes a new supplement, consumption and delivery model for IT services based on internet protocols and it typically involves provisioning of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. Most cloud computing infrastructures consist of services delivered through shared data centres and appearing as a single point of access for consumers computing needs. The main aim is to get the inhibitors of cloud environment and pursue a research using ISM so as to unfold the interrelationship among the inhibitors. These inhibitors will affect the services of the cloud computing directly or indirectly. Inhibitors are classified into four clusters based on the driving power and dependence power relation. In this way an action plan has been formulated for mitigating the most sensible inhibitors. The analysis should help the new and exciting cloud computing environment and should be useful to analyze the security issues of cloud computing.

Fast and Scalable Cloud Data Management,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c106307738?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Google%20Cloud&pi=2,"Felix,Gessert",Springer    ,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5080/9783030435080.jpg,9783030435080.0,"

The unprecedented scale at which data is both produced and consumed today has generated a large demand for scalable data management solutions facilitating fast access from all over the world. As one consequence, a plethora of non-relational, distributed NoSQL database systems have risen in recent years and today's data management system landscape has thus become somewhat hard to overlook. As another consequence, complex polyglot designs and elaborate schemes for data distribution and delivery have become the norm for building applications that connect users and organizations across the globe - but choosing the right combination of systems for a given use case has become increasingly difficult as well. To help practitioners stay on top of that challenge, this book presents a comprehensive overview and classification of the current system landscape in cloud data management as well as a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for efficient data distribution and delivery to end-user devices. The topics covered thus range from NoSQL storage systems and polyglot architectures (backend) over distributed transactions and Web caching (network) to data access and rendering performance in the client (end-user).By distinguishing popular data management systems by data model, consistency guarantees, and other dimensions of interest, this book provides an abstract framework for reasoning about the overall design space and the individual positions claimed by each of the systems therein. Building on this classification, this book further presents an application-driven decision guidance tool that breaks the process of choosing a set of viable system candidates for a given application scenario down into a straightforward decision tree.

Coud reliability engineering is a leading issue of cloud services. Cloud service providers guarantee computation, storage and applications through service-level agreements (SLAs) for promised levels of performance and uptime. Cloud Reliability Engineering: Technologies and Tools presents case studies examining cloud services, their challenges, and the reliability mechanisms used by cloud service providers. These case studies provide readers with techniques to harness cloud reliability and availability requirements in their own endeavors. Both conceptual and applied, the book explains reliability theory and the best practices used by cloud service companies to provide high availability. It also examines load balancing, and cloud security. Written by researchers and practitioners, the book's chapters are a comprehensive study of cloud reliability and availability issues and solutions. Various reliability class distributions and their effects on cloud reliability are discussed. An important aspect of reliability block diagrams is used to categorize poor reliability of cloud infrastructures, where enhancement can be made to lower the failure rate of the system. This technique can be used in design and functional stages to determine poor reliability of a system and provide target improvements. Load balancing for reliability is examined as a migrating process or performed by using virtual machines. The approach employed to identify the lightly loaded destination node to which the processes/virtual machines migrate can be optimized by employing a genetic algorithm. To analyze security risk and reliability, a novel technique for minimizing the number of keys and the security system is presented. The book also provides an overview of testing methods for the cloud, and a case study discusses testing reliability, installability, and security. A comprehensive volume, Cloud Reliability Engineering: Technologies and Tools combines research, theory, and best practices used to engineer reliable cloud availability and performance.

In there, you can select which features you wish to implement.Documents are stored on Google Drive and editable for applications such as Google Docs, Tickets, etc. But, what distinguishes Google Classroom from the standard Google Drive experience is the interface between teacher and student, developed by Google for the way teachers and students think and work. Google Classroom is a free Google created program.The platform helps communicate with teachers and students and can be used to coordinate and manage to learn. Google Classroom is considered an essential paperless teaching aid to help teachers and students collaborate. The software also allows teachers to teach from a distance and can provide much-needed support in the current environment. Teachers are going to be able to monitor each student's progress and return work after it has been graded. The teacher can comment on homework so that the students know what they did wrong and what they can improve. Teachers are also going to be able to create class announcements which students will have the ability to comment on.

Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Informatik - Internet, neue Technologien, Note: 1,2, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Ziel der Seminararbeit ist es, wesentliche Chancen und Risiken des Cloud Computings zu untersuchen und daraufhin festzustellen, ob es sich f羹r die Nutzung innerhalb eines Unternehmen eignet. Mittlerweile sind Informationstechnologien aus dem Alltag nicht mehr wegzudenken, da Bestellungen beispielsweise 羹ber Amazon get瓣tigt und Finanztransaktionen online durchgef羹hrt werden. Diese Aktivit瓣ten bringen einen wachsenden Bedarf an Datenverarbeitungs- und Speichersystemen, der teilweise durch die eigene Rechenleistung im Unternehmen oder im privaten Umfeld nicht abgedeckt werden kann. Der in den 90er-Jahren erstmals von Ramnath Chellappa (Chellappa, 1997) genutzte Begriff des Cloud Computing kann einen L繹sungsansatz darstellen, um den stetig wachsenden Bedarf an IT-Ressourcen zu decken. Durch das Cloud Computing werden dem Anwender scheinbar unendliche Ressourcen zur Verf羹gung gestellt, die auf den eigenen Bedarf angepasst und flexibel genutzt werden kann. Somit liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass das Cloud Computing dazu beitr瓣gt, die zuk羹nftigen Herausforderungen zu bew瓣ltigen. Jedoch stellt sich die Frage, welche Potentiale das Cloud Computing tats瓣chlich erf羹llen kann, welche Herausforderungen den Anwender erwarten und wie diese zu bew瓣ltigen sind.

Software Engineering in the Era of Cloud Computing,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c102170582?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Google%20Cloud&pi=6,"Muthu,Ramachandran",Springer    ,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6264/9783030336264.jpg,9783030336264.0,"

This book focuses on the development and implementation of cloud-based, complex software that allows parallelism, fast processing, and real-time connectivity. Software engineering (SE) is the design, development, testing, and implementation of software applications, and this discipline is as well developed as the practice is well established whereas the Cloud Software Engineering (CSE) is the design, development, testing, and continuous delivery of service-oriented software systems and applications (Software as a Service Paradigm). However, with the emergence of the highly attractive cloud computing (CC) paradigm, the tools and techniques for SE are changing. CC provides the latest software development environments and the necessary platforms relatively easily and inexpensively. It also allows the provision of software applications equally easily and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Business requirements for the use of software are also changing and there is a need for applications in big data analytics, parallel computing, AI, natural language processing, and biometrics, etc. These require huge amounts of computing power and sophisticated data management mechanisms, as well as device connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. In terms of hardware, software, communication, and storage, CC is highly attractive for developing complex software that is rapidly becoming essential for all sectors of life, including commerce, health, education, and transportation. The book fills a gap in the SE literature by providing scientific contributions from researchers and practitioners, focusing on frameworks, methodologies, applications, benefits and inherent challenges/barriers to engineering software using the CC paradigm.

In October 2011 Gartner highlighted cloud computing as one of the Top Ten Strategic Technologies for 2012, whereby a strategic technology is a technology ""with the potential for significant impact on the enterprise in the next three years"". Also Gartner forecasts the ""worldwide market for business intelligence (BI) software is [...] to grow 9.7 percent to reach US $ 10.8 billion in 2011"". These two reports from Gartner show that any company working either with cloud computing or business intelligence technologies should consider combining their approach with the other one. Moreover companies which are planning to make the move to one of these technologies should also think about the benefit of this combination. Also the increasing relevance of concepts like mobile business intelligence, which provides the ability to do analytical work on a phone or a tablet, makes cloud services more and more attractive for companies. This thesis will show how to build a business intelligence application from end to end with Windows Azure. It shows what is currently possible, what can be done with some effort and where current limitations are. The result of this thesis will be a roadmap for decisions makers, which will help IT managers decide if subsets of a business intelligence solution in Windows Azure can be completely or partly created in their company.

Cloud computing is the provision of IT resources (IaaS) on-demand using a pay as you go model over the internet. It is a broad and deep platform that helps customers builds sophisticated, scalable applications. To get the full benefits, research on a wide range of topics is needed. While resource over-provisioning can cost users more than necessary, resource under provisioning hurts the application performance. The cost effectiveness of cloud computing highly depends on how well the customer can optimize the cost of renting resources (VMs) from cloud providers. The issue of resource provisioning optimization from cloud-consumer potential is a complicated optimization issue, which includes much uncertainty parameters. There is a much research avenue available for solving this problem as it is in the real-world. Here, in this paper we provide details about various optimization techniques for resource provisioning.

Cloud computing moves computing and data away from desktop and mobile devices into large data center distributed around the world. As a result, this will create a need for a considerable risk assessment approach to manage the various types of risks. Risk assessment is a concept that has developed to the point where it has the potential to address current limitations in cloud computing assessment methodologies. The novelty of this book comes from the use of machine learning technique as a novel and efficient technique to assess risk in cloud computing environment. To build the model; first data mining algorithms are applied, then the ensemble method is used to combine the outputs of the data mining algorithms. The results of this research demonstrate the strengths of the use of data mining algorithms to assess risks, and it indicates that the methodology of using ensemble of machine learning algorithm represent a valuable alternative to existing methodologies.

Servers are stored on the Internet, allowing companies to handle data ""in the cloud"" instead of on a local server. It is a virtual space in which devices on the network can access data from anywhere. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Introduction to Famous Amazon Web Services is a robust cloud platform developed by Amazon's e-commerce giant. It offers software-as - a-Service (SaaS), platform-as - a-Service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as - a-Service (IaaS) services. Think about the history of the electricity supply to grasp the logic of AWS.Initially, factories will build their plants to fuel their facilities. Over time, governments and private investors have developed large power plants that supply electricity to numerous towns, factories, and homes. Under this new model, the factories will pay even less per unit of power due to the economies of scale enjoyed by the massive power plants. AWS was designed and built based on similar logic. This book covers the following topics:  - Cloud Concepts;- Security;- Technology;- Billing and pricing;- AWS Services. And Much More! By 2006, Amazon had established itself as the world's largest online retailer, a role it still holds. Seamlessly running such a vast operation required a large and sophisticated infrastructure. It imbued Amazon with deep expertise in the management of large-scale network and server networks. As a result, AWS was launched in 2006 as Amazon tried to make accessible to companies and individuals the technology infrastructure it had developed and the expertise it had gained. AWS was one of the first pay-as-you-go (PAYG) computing models that could scale performance, storage, and computing based on the evolving needs of the user.

Cloud computing offers enterprises a method to access computing resources on-demand. This allows enterprises to save on capital expenses related to periodic hardware upgrades, maintenance and energy costs. However data traversing in cloud, leads to data breaching and data loss by third party intruders affecting the managing and reliability of sensitive information. A virtual private network, VPN, is a typical way of interconnecting networks over a public network infrastructure securing data transferred across the private subnets. The goal of this project is to provide VPN as a service using virtualized VPN software, essentially making the VPN yet another building block for a service in the cloud.

This book provides a comprehensive review of the most up to date research related to cloud security auditing and discusses auditing the cloud infrastructure from the structural point of view, while focusing on virtualization-related security properties and consistency between multiple control layers. It presents an off-line automated framework for auditing consistent isolation between virtual networks in OpenStack-managed cloud spanning over overlay and layer 2 by considering both cloud layers' views. A runtime security auditing framework for the cloud with special focus on the user-level including common access control and authentication mechanisms e.g., RBAC, ABAC and SSO is covered as well. This book also discusses a learning-based proactive security auditing system, which extracts probabilistic dependencies between runtime events and applies such dependencies to proactively audit and prevent security violations resulting from critical events. Finally, this book elaborates the design and implementation of a middleware as a pluggable interface to OpenStack for intercepting and verifying the legitimacy of user requests at runtime.Many companies nowadays leverage cloud services for conducting major business operations (e.g., Web service, inventory management, customer service, etc.). However, the fear of losing control and governance still persists due to the inherent lack of transparency and trust in clouds. The complex design and implementation of cloud infrastructures may cause numerous vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, while the unique properties of clouds (elastic, self-service, multi-tenancy) can bring novel security challenges. In this book, the authors discuss how state-of-the-art security auditing solutions may help increase cloud tenants' trust in the service providers by providing assurance on the compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards. This book introduces the latest research results on both traditional retroactive auditing and novel (runtime and proactive) auditing techniques to serve different stakeholders in the cloud. This book covers security threats from different cloud abstraction levels and discusses a wide-range of security properties related to cloud-specific standards (e.g., Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) and ISO 27017). It also elaborates on the integration of security auditing solutions into real world cloud management platforms (e.g., OpenStack, Amazon AWS and Google GCP).This book targets industrial scientists, who are working on cloud or security-related topics, as well as security practitioners, administrators, cloud providers and operators.Researchers and advanced-level students studying and working in computer science, practically in cloud security will also be interested in this book.

Scheduling is the assignment of limited resources to tasks in time, to optimizing one or more objective functions. Therefore it is necessary to find appropriate solutions to this problem. Because of their deterministic and sequential nature, the traditional problems are not able to handle the completely non-linear space of job shop scheduling problem. In order to find an appropriate solution, the genetic algorithm must have the chance of producing a big part of the solution space, in its population. Therefore for a very hard problem such as job shop scheduling, the genetic algorithm population must be as large as possible. However the larger population introduces a big computational time, especially in a single common computer, the genetic algorithm is executed sequentially and therefore it is unable to handle larger populations. In this book, we introduced a cloud computing framework to execute the genetic algorithms with large population sizes and overcome limited resource problem of common single computers.

This work investigates in a forecast application whether the forecast accuracy of the US unemployment growth rate can be improved when the time series model is augmented with Google Trends data. The empirical analysis is based on up to 10 distinct Google Trends search terms, which show a sufficiently high correlation with the target variable US unemployment rate. A Google index from the 10 Google search terms is derived by estimating a Factor model with the method of principal component analysis. By using a VAR model it is empirically shown that the forecast accuracy of the US unemployment growth rate can be improved by augmenting the model with the Google search terms.

Durch den Wandel von Investitionen zu variablen Kosten kann Cloud Computing zu Geld- und Aufwandseinsparungen sowie zu h繹herer Flexibilit瓣t in Unternehmen f羹hren. SOA basierte Business Workflows in eine Cloud Computing Umgebung auszulagern ist somit nur die logische Fortsetzung des SOA Grundprinzips zur Erh繹hung der Flexibilit瓣t. In dieser Arbeit soll ein Konzept zur Migration vorgegebener Softwarebestandteile in die Cloud entwickelt werden. Neben den betriebswirt-schaftlichen Aspekten, unter denen diese L繹sung betrachtet wird, wird auch gekl瓣rt, ob alle Softwarebestandteile ausgelagert werden sollten. Dabei werden z. B. Datenschutzaspekte und technische Fragestellungen wie die Verf羹gbarkeit und die ben繹tigte Rechenkapazit瓣t betrachtet. Weiterhin wird auch gekl瓣rt, welche Anbieter besonders geeignet scheinen, die definierten Anspr羹che zu erf羹llen. Abschlie?end wird anhand einer prototypischen Implementierung gezeigt, dass das erarbeitete Konzept zum Einsatz gebracht werden kann.

In this book, a novel technique kFloWar for job submission in Cloud environment is proposed and tested. kFloWar technique considers both cloudlet transfer time and file transfer time while selecting appropriate hosts for cloudlet (job) submission on distributed resources with an objective to minimize execution time and cost. As cloud computing itself is a bigger umbrella that is merged with different technologies. This complex integration is also having a bad impact on the performance of cloud environment. This work is aimed to improve the performance of cloud environment with Dynamic Resource allocation Algorithm using Clustering. It arranges the virtual machines in cluster form before allocating them to the datacenters. This arrangement provides an efficient CPU utilization and load sharing among the datacenters, so the performance can be enhanced in some aspects. It has been proved through experiments that kFloWar algorithm is having better performance than the existing algorithms.

Cloud computing gives an opportunity to use Internet-based services by business organizations. Use of cloud infra structure will reduce start-up costs, lower capital expenditures for organizations. Organizations use cloud services on a pay-as-you-use basis, access applications only as needed, and quickly reduce or increase capacities. Security is a major concern for data stored on cloud.Security to the data and applications is provided by authorization and authentication. Authorization for accessing the data is provided by access control models.Traditional access control models are not sufficient to cater applications running on cloud due to its dynamic nature. Various attribute based access control models are proposed for cloud computing. This book discusses the various authorization security challenges and proposed attribute based access control models to ensure security. The authors discuss the extremely challenging topics of data ownership, privacy protection, majorly focuses on encryption based access control models. This book is mandatory reading for research scholars, students involved in security aspects of cloud computing.

There are inhabitory planetary systems in different galaxies and it is paradoxical that human beings are not come into contact with alien intelligence. The intergalactic archaeal quantal computing clouds serves as the master of the universe and as the ubiquitous universal observer. The quantal computing archaeal clouds seed life in different planetary systems of galaxies. The universe can exist in the particulate and quantal state with swings between the two states determined by the master archaeal quantal computing cloud which functions as ubiquitous observer and intelligence controlling, creating and regulating the universe. Each civilization has a particulate and quantal counterpart. The particulate part of the civilization is not sensed by another civilization. The quantal computing cloud serving as the master intelligence is a universal observer and prevents particulate civilizations from coming to contact. The quantal civilizations inhabiting multiverses are in contact with each other through worm holes. Every civilization is a dark forest. Contact with another civilization results in annihilation. Therefore contact with other galactic civilizations is an impossibility.

For easier accessing of files and to generate file indexes, each file is stored in cloud server. Now cloud users search files and again send download request to cloud server. This process is time consuming and also there is a chance that the cloud service provider might access those files which is stored in the cloud server, because both the encrypted file with correspondent keys and file indexes are stored in cloud server. To overcome these problems, this system introduces storage nodes for storing file indexes and encrypted files and cloud server stores files keys. When a cloud user uploads file, the file index is generated automatically and file is encrypted by using AES algorithm with automatically generated key. After that by Visual cryptography scheme, the key is converted into image and then generated as key image and source images respectively. The encrypted file and the file indexes are stored in storage node, key and source image are stored in cloud server and key image is passed to file owner. Whenever file owner or file users want to download or access files then perform search and then put key image as an input.

The optimization of traffic management operations has become a considerable challenge in today's global scope due to the significant increase in the number of vehicles, traffic congestions, and automobile accidents. Fortunately, there has been substantial progress in the application of intelligent computing devices to transportation processes. Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are a specific practice that merges the connectivity of wireless technologies with smart vehicles. Despite its relevance, empirical research is lacking on the developments being made in VANETs and how certain intelligent technologies are being applied within transportation systems. IoT and Cloud Computing Advancements in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks provides emerging research exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of intelligent transportation systems and analyzing the modern techniques that are being applied to smart vehicles through cloud technology. Featuring coverage on a broad range of topics such as health monitoring, node localization, and fault tolerance, this book is ideally designed for network designers, developers, analysists, IT specialists, computing professionals, researchers, academics, and post-graduate students seeking current research on emerging computing concepts and developments in vehicular ad-hoc networks.

Bachelorarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Informatik - Wirtschaftsinformatik, Note: 1,7, AKAD University, ehem. AKAD Fachhochschule Stuttgart, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit sollen die Vor- und Nachteile sowie die Chancen und Risiken untersucht werden, die sich f羹r ein Unternehmen ergeben, wenn computergest羹tzte Systeme, die unter gesetzliche Regularien fallen und zu validieren sind, in eine externe Cloud 羹berf羹hrt oder implementiert werden. Da die verschiedenen Regelwerke und ihre Anforderungen - n瓣mlich, dass computergest羹tzte Systeme zu validieren sind - sich sehr 瓣hneln, liegt der Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit auf den Regeln der europ瓣ischen Good Manufacturing Practice. Andere geltende Richtlinien werden erw瓣hnt, wenn dies angebracht ist. Die Untersuchung ber羹cksichtigt prim瓣r den operationellen Lebenszyklus, beginnend mit der Installation eines computergest羹tzten Systems und den Anforderungen, die von einer IT-Einheit bzw. einem Dienstleister erbracht werden m羹ssen. Cloud-Computing erfreut sich seit Jahren einer zunehmenden Beliebtheit. So nutzt heute schon mehr als die H瓣lfte der Unternehmen in Deutschland diese Technologie. Schlie?lich verspricht sie finanzielle, operative und strategische Vorteile. Durch die zunehmende Verbreitung von Cloud-L繹sungen kommen diese auch vermehrt in pharmazeutischen Unternehmen zum Einsatz. Aber gerade in der pharmazeutischen Industrie ist es wichtig zu verstehen, in welchem Umfeld IT-L繹sungen eingesetzt werden.

What is ""the cloud""? Is it here or there? Should it be allowed? Should I even care? Have you ever imagined the internet as a giant Rube Goldberg machine? Or the fast-evolving cloud computing space as a literal jungle filled with prehistoric beasts? Does a data breach look like a neo-noir nightmare full of turned-up coat collars and rain-soaked alleys? Wouldn't all these vital concepts be easier to understand if they looked as interesting as they are? And wouldn't they be more memorable if we could explain them in rhyme? Whether you're a kid or an adult, the answer is: YES! The medicine in this spoonful of sugar is a sneaky-informative tour through the past, present and future of cloud computing, from mainframes to serverless and from the Internet of Things to artificial intelligence. Forrest is a professional explainer whose highly-rated conference talks and viral cartoon graphics have been teaching engineers to cloud for years. He knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But he has plenty of words, too. Your hotel key, your boarding pass, The card you swipe to pay for gas, The smart TV atop the bar, The entertainment in your car, Your doorbell, toothbrush, thermostat, The vacuum that attacked your cat, They all connect the cloud and you.Maybe they shouldn't, but they do.  As a graduation gift (call it ""Oh the Places You'll Go"" for engineering students), a cubicle conversation starter, or just a delightfully nerdy bedtime story for your kids, ""The Read-Aloud Cloud"" will be the definitive introduction to the technologies that everyone uses and nobody understands. You can even read it silently if you want. But good luck with that.

Cloud computing applications are growing exponentially because of the increase in demand. Cloud is a complex distributed system in which hundreds of components interact with each other. An important risk is cloud computing platform is to provide a secure computing platform to the cloud users. Trusted third party based scheme used in traditional security systems cannot be used directly in cloud platforms. Swarm based trust verification scheme enables security in cloud platform. Cloud computing offers different sets of services to the users and gaining popularity in recent years because of its ease of use. Dynamically configurable virtualized resources make the physical location of the data independent from its representation and the users have no control over the physical placement of data. Providing flexible computing services via internet pose high security challenge to the cloud users. Because of these security risks making the cloud computing environment trustable is the need of the hour.

Cloud computing is a virtualized shared pool of hardware. It is playing a prominent role in service-oriented computing paradigm. Service-oriented computing is a subset of utility computing. There are various features of utility-based computing. Utility computing paradigm includes cloud computing and grid computing. It provides hardware and application software as a service. Efficient resource management is one of the claiming concern in scalable shared pool of blade servers. The shared pool of servers places in different time zone. In scalable cloud aura, trust-based dependent tasks scheduling is the prominent affair. Specifically we focus on dependent tasks provisioning. The performance metrics include execution time, failure probability, and reliability. The performance metrics are measured using the trust aware Max-Min and trust aware Min-Min scheduling. The proposed trust aware Min-Min scheduling, and trust aware Max-Min techniques outperform the Min-Min, and Max-Min approaches. The performance metrics are measured using various types of tasks. The failure probability, Reliability, and execution time measure the level of trust of the TMax-Min and TMin-Min techniques.

In the cloud environment, cloud storage is considered to be an essential service in the present day. Since users can store personal data online and can be able to retrieve the data or remotely store and manage via the internet. Authentication and authorization must be provided perfectly as illegal users may reveal the Information of data stored and the symmetric key information used by the users. Long-standing data or keys are sensitive to brute force attacks and any other attacks. So Cloud Server has to take care of these issues.

Cloud is completely the internet dependent technology where client data is stored and maintained in the data centre of a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.som and Microsoft etc. CSP is responsible for maintaining and monitoring the outsourced data. Limited control over the data may incur various security issues and threats which include data leakage, insecure interface, sharing of resources, data availability and inside attacks. The issues start from Security, Availability, Performance, Lack of Standards, Increased Usage Cost, and Struggle in integrating with on-premise IT resources. So many customers do not fully depend on the cloud environment because of their unawareness of the location where their data would be stored, its availability in their need, and data processing by others. For these reasons many of the researchers concentrates on the ""Security"" aspect of the cloud. Data security can be achieved by the parameters like confidentiality, integrity and availability. This research work fully concentrated on the parameter like confidentiality. In this book, various algorithms have been proposed to enhance the security of data at rest.

A crypto faucet is a website that will give you satoshis in exchange for viewing ads or completing simple tasks. Crypto currency mining is the process in which transactions between users are verified and added into the block chain. The process of mining is also responsible for introducing new coins into the existing circulating supply and is one of the key elements that allow cryptocurrencies to work as a peer-to-peer decentralized network, without the need for a third party central authority. Cloud mining happens in the ""cloud."" That basically means that the hardware used for mining is not physically located at your premises, but it is accessed remotely through the internet. An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending free coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. In Bounty programs, participants get cryptocurrencies in exchange for promotion. A cryptocurrency exchange is any system that operates on the basis of trading cryptocurrencies with other assets. There are also some on-line service designed for those who wants to exchange electronic currencies quickly, safely and at a favorable rate, such as: Webmoney, Perfect Money, AdvCash, Payeer, Skrill, Neteller, Epay, Payza, PayPal, Visa/Master Card, Western uniоn, MoneyGram, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin.

This book is a list of facts about the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which I created when I was preparing for Google's cloud architecture exam. It's an extremely concise summary, that goes straight to what architects need to know. To be a cloud architect you need to know tons of facts, and I've focused here on those details which I found tricky and not obvious.In addition to the key features of each GCP service, I've also included in this book several tables that compare these services to each other. This can help as a reference when you need to choose between architecture options - in an exam, interview or in your real work.Read more about the book at economo.tech.

Life in earth would have evolved by seeding of viroids & archaea from the outer space consequent to asteroidal hits. The universe would have a biological origin and it is plausible that there is an extraterrestrial intelligence in the form of a quantal computing cloud formed of archaea, viroids and porphyrions controlling & creating the universe- a biological God. The quantal computing cloud in the intergalactic space can seed organisms into the earth off & on through asteroidal impacting infusing a fresh set of cometary genes into the planet and regulating the planet organization and function. Evolution of life and species on earth would have occurred by the phenomena of panspermia. Viral pandemics like covid-19 occurring in earth at recurrent periods of time would be generated by the extraterrestrial quantal computing biological cloud due to asteroidal impacts. A microbiological origin of the universe formed of intergalactic magnetic fields generated by magnetotactic bacteria is plausible. The seeding of the earth by the extraterrestrial quantal computing biological cloud can be a deliberate act of communication by alien quantal computing cloud.

Bachelorarbeit aus dem Jahr 2019 im Fachbereich Informatik - Wirtschaftsinformatik, Note: 1,00, Universit瓣t Augsburg, Veranstaltung: Wirtschaftsinformatik und Management Support, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Die Ressource ""Daten"" und die daraus gewonnenen Informationen erhalten f羹r Unternehmen in der heute zunehmend digitalisierten Welt einen immer h繹heren Stellenwert. Der Zugang zu richtigen Informationen zur richtigen Zeit und am richtigen Ort und die M繹glichkeit, diese sinnvoll auszuwerten, ist dabei essenziell. Die zu diesem Zweck entwickelten Visualisierungsformen von Berichten und Dashboards variieren sogar innerhalb von einzelnen Unternehmen erheblich. Um diese zu vereinheitlichen und zu standardisieren, wurden die sogenannten International Business Communication Standards (IBCS) formuliert. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, das marktf羹hrende Webanalyse-Tool Google Analytics auf diese Standards hin zu pr羹fen. Hierbei wurden die M繹glichkeiten innerhalb der Erstellung von personalisierten Dashboards auf Notationsstandards der IBCS gepr羹ft und die daraus gewonnenen Erkenntnisse f羹r Anwender und Softwarehersteller zusammengefasst. Google Analytics bietet eine kontinuierliche Webseitenanalyse und statistische Auswertungen. Dank zahlreicher vorgefertigter Berichte kann man einen schnellen Einblick in das Verhalten der Webseitennutzer bzw. in die Webseitenperformance bekommen. Es vereinfacht auch die Erstellung eigener Dashboards zur Darstellung unternehmensspezifischer Kennzahlen. Die Visualisierungsformen von Google Analytics sind auf den ersten Blick ansprechend und f羹r eine ?bersicht von Echtzeitdaten oder Kennzahlen des Nutzerverhaltens oder des E-Commerce Bereichs sehr hilfreich. Allerdings dringt Google mit der Visualisierung von Webseiten- und Gesch瓣ftsdaten in den Bereich der Informationsvisualisierung vor. Hierbei muss nicht nur die Korrektheit der Darstellungen gew瓣hrleistet sein, auch Faktoren wie Informationsdichte oder Einheitlichkeit spielen eine wichtige

Are you ready to enter the cloud?Remember when you used to pay for things?! When computer software was almost as much as your new computer. Times have certainly changed! Today many companies are giving you all that stuff you used to pay hundreds of dollars for--for free! What's the catch? There has to be a catch! Sometimes there definitely is a catch...it's free, but you have to watch a 30 second commercial every five minutes. Or it's free but you have to pay a subscription once you start to really like it. In the case of Google Apps, it truly is free. No annoying ads. No money grabs. Nothing.  For the price of nothing you are getting online software that is on par with the Office suite you grew to love--and pay hundreds of dollars for. That means you get writing software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, and more...and you don't pay a dime! Now you see why so many people are making the switch to Google Apps? Who wouldn't want to pay nothing for good software? This book covers: Google Drive. Google Docs. Google Sheets. Google Slides. Google Forms. If you are interested in learning more about it, or you are ready to make the leap and become a free user, then this guide will show you the ropes and get you started as quickly as possible. Let's get started! This book is not endorsed by Alphabet, Inc.

◎應用數學權威理性解析演算法與社會，讓我們對演算法不再害怕的第一本書

◎資訊社會學專家曹家榮（世新大學社會心理學系助理教授）專文導讀

 

從選餐廳到選總統，演算法正全面影響我們的生活？

Facebook和劍橋分析公司分享用戶個資，讓演算法操弄人心？

Google的搜尋演算法暗藏性別與種族歧視？

 

讓應用數學權威帶我們一一解答以上的問題。

		 

		　　我們對科技與網路的仰賴有如開了一扇窗，讓數學家和資料研究者得以窺探我們的生活。他們不斷蒐集資料，了解我們去哪裡旅行、上哪裡購物、買些什麼、對什麼感興趣，進而預測我們的生活習慣。有些人甚至宣稱，這些資料就足以操弄人心、改變國家輿論。但這些資料到底多可靠？唯有了解數學做得到和做不到什麼，才能明白演算法正如何改變我們的生活。

		 

演算法到底能多了解我們？

		2018年Facebook爆出與劍橋分析公司分享用戶個資的事件。劍橋分析公司宣稱，他們能從資料中分析出個人的政治傾向，以針對這些人投放量身打造的競選宣傳。然而這些劍橋分析公司取得的資料，真的能讓他們做成一個完整的「人格分析」演算法嗎？另外，Google引以為傲的搜尋演算規則，是否會擴大我們的偏見，讓我們「學會」歧視？

		 

了解演算法，不必再對科技擔心受怕

		　　演算法和操弄人心的恐慌正在蔓延，而本書作者帶領我們遍觀各種演算法，看見數學不為人知的一面。藉由訪問走在演算法研究最前端的科學家並自己做數學實驗分析佐證，作者除了解釋數學與統計如何運用於現實生活，也說明了現今社群演算法的能力與極限，讓我們更了解現今的網路服務是如何影響我們。

This book provides a comprehensive review of the most up to date research related to cloud security auditing and discusses auditing the cloud infrastructure from the structural point of view, while focusing on virtualization-related security properties and consistency between multiple control layers. It presents an off-line automated framework for auditing consistent isolation between virtual networks in OpenStack-managed cloud spanning over overlay and layer 2 by considering both cloud layers' views. A runtime security auditing framework for the cloud with special focus on the user-level including common access control and authentication mechanisms e.g., RBAC, ABAC and SSO is covered as well. This book also discusses a learning-based proactive security auditing system, which extracts probabilistic dependencies between runtime events and applies such dependencies to proactively audit and prevent security violations resulting from critical events. Finally, this book elaborates the design and implementation of a middleware as a pluggable interface to OpenStack for intercepting and verifying the legitimacy of user requests at runtime.Many companies nowadays leverage cloud services for conducting major business operations (e.g., Web service, inventory management, customer service, etc.). However, the fear of losing control and governance still persists due to the inherent lack of transparency and trust in clouds. The complex design and implementation of cloud infrastructures may cause numerous vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, while the unique properties of clouds (elastic, self-service, multi-tenancy) can bring novel security challenges. In this book, the authors discuss how state-of-the-art security auditing solutions may help increase cloud tenants' trust in the service providers by providing assurance on the compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards. This book introduces the latest research results on both traditional retroactive auditing and novel (runtime and proactive) auditing techniques to serve different stakeholders in the cloud. This book covers security threats from different cloud abstraction levels and discusses a wide-range of security properties related to cloud-specific standards (e.g., Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) and ISO 27017). It also elaborates on the integration of security auditing solutions into real world cloud management platforms (e.g., OpenStack, Amazon AWS and Google GCP).This book targets industrial scientists, who are working on cloud or security-related topics, as well as security practitioners, administrators, cloud providers and operators.Researchers and advanced-level students studying and working in computer science, practically in cloud security will also be interested in this book.

Network revolutions of the past have shaped the present and set the stage for the revolution we are experiencing todayIn an era of seemingly instant change, it's easy to think that today's revolutions--in communications, business, and many areas of daily life--are unprecedented. Today's changes may be new and may be happening faster than ever before. But our ancestors at times were just as bewildered by rapid upheavals in what we now call ""networks""--the physical links that bind any society together.In this fascinating book, former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler brings to life the two great network revolutions of the past and uses them to help put in perspective the confusion, uncertainty, and even excitement most people face today. The first big network revolution was the invention of movable-type printing in the fifteenth century. This book, its millions of predecessors, and even such broad trends as the Reformation, the Renaissance, and the multiple scientific revolutions of the past 500 years would not have been possible without that one invention. The second revolution came with the invention of the telegraph early in the nineteenth century. Never before had people been able to communicate over long distances faster than a horse could travel. Along with the development of the world's first high-speed network--the railroad--the telegraph upended centuries of stability and literally redrew the map of the world.Wheeler puts these past revolutions into the perspective of today, when rapid-fire changes in networking are upending the nature of work, personal privacy, education, the media, and nearly every other aspect of modern life. But he doesn't leave it there. Outlining ""What's Next,"" he describes how artificial intelligence, virtual reality, blockchain, and the need for cybersecurity are laying the foundation for a third network revolution.

The cloud is your company's biggest risk - if you don't adopt it. Regulated companies have a hard problem to solve. They run the existential risk of becoming obsolete due to an inability to adopt new technology fast enough. The cloud can help, but balancing the requirements of compliance is hard to understand. Complete Cloud Compliance gives the playbook for how regulated companies can adopt the cloud with confidence.

Cloud service benchmarking can provide important, sometimes surprising insights into the quality of services and leads to a more quality-driven design and engineering of complex software architectures that use such services. Starting with a broad introduction to the field, this book guides readers step-by-step through the process of designing, implementing and executing a cloud service benchmark, as well as understanding and dealing with its results. It covers all aspects of cloud service benchmarking, i.e., both benchmarking the cloud and benchmarking in the cloud, at a basic level.The book is divided into five parts: Part I discusses what cloud benchmarking is, provides an overview of cloud services and their key properties, and describes the notion of a cloud system and cloud-service quality. It also addresses the benchmarking lifecycle and the motivations behind running benchmarks in particular phases of an application lifecycle. Part II then focuses on benchmark design by discussing key objectives (e.g., repeatability, fairness, or understandability) and defining metrics and measurement methods, and by giving advice on developing own measurement methods and metrics. Next, Part III explores benchmark execution and implementation challenges and objectives as well as aspects like runtime monitoring and result collection. Subsequently, Part IV addresses benchmark results, covering topics such as an abstract process for turning data into insights, data preprocessing, and basic data analysis methods. Lastly, Part V concludes the book with a summary, suggestions for further reading and pointers to benchmarking tools available on the Web.The book is intended for researchers and graduate students of computer science and related subjects looking for an introduction to benchmarking cloud services, but also for industry practitioners who are interested in evaluating the quality of cloud services or who want to assess key qualities of their own implementations through cloud-based experiments.

This book intends to change the perception of modern day telecommunications. Communication systems, usually perceived as ""dumb pipes"", carrying information / data from one point to another, are evolved into intelligently communicating smart systems. The book introduces a new field of cloud communications. The concept, theory, and architecture of this new field of cloud communications are discussed. The book lays down nine design postulates that form the basis of the development of a first of its kind cloud communication paradigm entitled Green Symbiotic Cloud Communications or GSCC. The proposed design postulates are formulated in a generic way to form the backbone for development of systems and technologies of the future. The book can be used to develop courses that serve as an essential part of graduate curriculum in computer science and electrical engineering. Such courses can be independent or part of high-level research courses. The book will also be of interest to a wide range of readers including both scientific and non-scientific domains as it discusses innovations from a simplistic explanatory viewpoint.

Melanie Holloway explores a cloud broker offering service level agreement negotiation and monitoring as a service to consumers. She proposes a negotiation mechanism, which enables the achievement of economically efficient agreements, and an approach for reliable consumer side availability monitoring in conjunction with strategies for robust monitor placement. The author addresses the loss of control of consumers over critical aspects, specifically quality of service, when using services from the cloud.Basically, the cloud computing paradigm places the responsibility for resource management on the provider side. Hence, the control over cloud service performance is very limited on the consumer side.

This book develops a crowdsourced sensor-cloud service composition framework taking into account spatio-temporal aspects. This book also unfolds new horizons to service-oriented computing towards the direction of crowdsourced sensor data based applications, in the broader context of Internet of Things (IoT). It is a massive challenge for the IoT research field how to effectively and efficiently capture, manage and deliver sensed data as user-desired services. The outcome of this research will contribute to solving this very important question, by designing a novel service framework and a set of unique service selection and composition frameworks.Delivering a novel service framework to manage crowdsourced sensor data provides high-level abstraction (i.e., sensor-cloud service) to model crowdsourced sensor data from functional and non-functional perspectives, seamlessly turning the raw data into ""ready to go"" services. A creative indexing model is developed to capture and manage the spatio-temporal dynamism of crowdsourced service providers.Delivering novel frameworks to compose crowdsourced sensor-cloud services is vital. These frameworks focuses on spatio-temporal composition of crowdsourced sensor-cloud services, which is a new territory for existing service oriented computing research. A creative failure-proof model is also designed to prevent composition failure caused by fluctuating QoS.Delivering an incentive model to drive the coverage of crowdsourced service providers is also vital. A new spatio-temporal incentive model targets changing coverage of the crowdsourced providers to achieve demanded coverage of crowdsourced sensor-cloud services within a region.The outcome of this research is expected to potentially create a sensor services crowdsourcing market and new commercial opportunities focusing on crowdsourced data based applications. The crowdsourced community based approach adds significant value to journey planning and map services thus creating a competitive edge for a technologically-minded companies incentivizing new start-ups, thus enabling higher market innovation.This book primarily targets researchers and practitioners, who conduct research work in service oriented computing, Internet of Things (IoT), smart city and spatio-temporal travel planning, as well as advanced-level students studying this field.

This bestselling book, originally published as a companion volume for public television's Nature series, Cloud: The Wild Stallion of the Rockies is documentary filmmaker Ginger Kathrens's personal retelling of her years following the wild horse she named Cloud. Beautifully designed, the book is elaborately photographed and divided into seventeen chapters that follow the life of a wild stallion, just one of hundreds of horses that have roamed wild in the Rocky Mountains for two hundred years. The book begins with the author and filmmaker witnessing the birth of a helpless white colt, that will soon capture her heart and imagination. Each subsequent chapter documents Cloud's interaction with his mare Raven, his brother Diamond, and other colts in the wild as well as his adventures encountering dangerous predators, older stallions, and human trappers. The author follows Cloud over the course of five years, taking note of his physical and behavioral development, as his begins to take on more of a leadership role in the band of wild bachelors he's joined, to become a fighter, a survivor, and a father. Kathrens's emotional involvement in Cloud's story is palpable, such as when she tearfully watches the young stallion get captured by trappers. Due to his unusual coloration, he is set free, though the other members of his band and sisters are removed and sold. Returning to the mountains every season, the author continues to look for Cloud in the vast wild habitat, always relieved to find him still living, despite fights, predators, and encounters with trappers. She is later is touched to see how Cloud, the five-year-old mare, grazes with his yearling son, the first of his new family. Kathrens's gripping observations of wild horses of the Arrowheads, their fights, struggles, and alliances, give the reader much insight into the fascinating behavior of these wild horses. Now published in paperback for the first time, this updated and fully redesigned volume coincides with the one year anniversary of the last sighting of Cloud.

你要聽特斯拉馬斯克的或是臉書祖克伯的？
前者認為人工智慧（AI）會毁滅人類，後者說不會！
其實你應聽Google的，
它提供平台讓中小企業也可以搭上人工智慧的特快車！


	將衝擊世界的人工智慧類型基本上是指會自己學習的電腦，也就是所謂的機器學習（Machine Learning）及深度學習（Deep learning），而非過去大家習慣的電腦依程式行事。前者是指機器自己由大量資料中，得出某結論，如給電腦一堆貓的圖片，他會自己替貓做定義，進而由一張被切割的照片中，判斷那是不是貓。而深度學習則是電腦自行處理多層結構的訊息，而進行判讀。

人工智慧用5000部影片，就可以自己學會讀唇語！

	曾有研究單位利用「深度學習」學習唇語的判讀，他們將英國BBC電視頻道的多個節目系列、合計約五千小時的影片做為學習的資料。學習後的電腦，在兩百支影片測驗組合中，光靠唇部動作便成功解讀出大約百分之五十的單字。而即使是在法庭上擁有十年以上經驗的唇語術專家，在相同的測驗中也只能判讀四分之一左右的單字。

	電腦具備自主學習及判斷能力的事實將對人類社會產生重大衝擊，本書不只以一般人能理解的方式說明人工智慧在技術方面的進展，更以大量的實例，說明目前全球各種規模的企業如何利用會「學習」的電腦，來改變企業的運作。例如客戶服務的工作，原本極為依靠人力，但是，現在只要投入大量過去的QA，電腦會自己學會如何對應客戶；如語文的翻譯，電腦也可以自己由大量的翻譯資訊中學習，讓翻譯的品質提升。

	善用人工智慧技術的企業，將在企業的經營上（至少成本的控制上），取得領先。問題是人工智慧的發展是否有很高的技術門檻？阻擋一般的中小企業於門外？其實不然。

中小企業也可以利用Google平台提供的應用程式介面，發展自己的深度學習運用

	谷歌在其雲端服務「Google Cloud Platform（GCP）」中，將谷歌研究開發至今的深度學習成果透過兩種方式開放一般大眾使用（Google目前將人工智慧用在公司一千種服務以上）：一種是將機器學習訓練完畢的模型，以應用程式介面 (Application Programming Interface；API)方式提供服務。另一種是提供機器學習程式庫「開源機器學習系統（Tensor Flow）」。

	應用程式介面（API）一般是指能將擁有特定機能的電腦程式由外部程式叫出使用的介面。透過應用程式介面與電腦程式連結，就可以直接利用其功能。

	谷歌將許多不同種類具有「機器學習」或是「深度學習」能力的「模型」放在「谷歌雲端平台（GCP）」。中小企業可以利用應用程式介面，直接利用其功能。而這些「模型」已經經過基本的「訓練」，因此使用者只要提供少量的資料，就可以達成學習的目的。

	因為有了應用程式介面（API）的提供，使得「機器學習」與「深度學習」為一般企業所用的門檻大幅降低了。只需以程式介面（API）程式將「模型」叫出，就能使用圖像辨識與語音辨識的最新成果，真的很方便。

	不過另一方面，許多太專業的運用，如人體器官病徵的辨識或是機械故障的預兆判斷等，無法以應用程式介面（API）套用現有的「模型」。谷歌所準備的機器學習程式庫「開源機器學習系統 TensorFlow」將派上用場。使用者可以下載程式，自行發展所需要的功能。「使用TensorFlow最大的好處，是只要以Python語言寫出簡單的程式碼，就能運用深度學習」。

	本書不只告訴你人工智慧是什麼？將改變什麼？更告訴你可以做什麼，讓公司保持在科技的浪潮尖端。

本書特色

從定義到駕御：讓你徹底搞懂將對人類產生鉅大影響的科技

	本書在觀察大量企業的運用後，在第五章《架構活用篇》提出導入的深度學習的具體架構，讓讀者不只能懂，也能縮短運用時摸索的時間。本書發現人工智慧（機器學習、深度學習）的風潮席捲全球，不過其在企業運用的目的不外以下幾種：1、刪減成本。2、提高附加價值創造出新的商機。3、提升創意性。而在觀察幾百家企業的操作後，發現以刪減成本的目的最容易產生效果。

用案例讓讀者完全理解

	對沒有技術背景的民眾而言，最關心的是人工智慧（機器學習、深度學習）要如何運用，本書以實際的案例說明相關問題：

	■ 安藤HAZAMA――用以判斷隧道工程之岩盤硬度

	為了建設隧道工程時能兼具安全與效率，安藤HAZAMA與日本系統軟體共同開發的「隧道開挖面AI自動評價系統」。將挖掘隧道時最尖端之開挖面照片輸入後，該系統就會自動評價其岩盤的硬度、脆性等工學特性。透過人工智慧帶來的岩盤工學特性評價自動化，即使沒有專家或資深技師在場，也能給予正確的判斷。

	在學習之際，將五百張左右的相片進行分割，製作成五萬張的相片資料。結合相片岩石所代表的彈性波速度，一起讓機器學習的結果，在拍攝開挖面相片後，就能得到彈性波的速度值。新系統在從開挖面的相片辨識其相對應的彈性波速度上，正確率大約有百分之八十五。

	■ AUCNET IBS――從車輛相片就能鎖定款式

	深度學習特別適用於圖片的識別。從事支援中古車等業者間交易的AUCNET（位於東京都港區）系統開發子公司之AUCNET IBS就是圖片識別運用的例子。該公司運用深度學習技術，開發了能自動將車輛不同部位照片歸類上傳到網站的系統「konpeki（紺碧）」。二〇一六年十一月集團旗下的中古車經銷商FLEX（東京都港區）採用了這個系統，提升網站上資訊登錄作業的效率。

	中古車經銷商經常需要為購入的中古車拍攝許多相片、進行上傳到自家網站或資訊網站的作業。車子的左斜前方、右斜前方、右側、左側、後方、還有車內的前座及後座、儀表板、導航等……。這些相片如果由店員手工整理的話，大概要花個五分鐘左右。Konpeki系統只要經銷商店員將拍攝的相片登錄，就立刻能自動依部位別分類，輕鬆地上傳至中古車資訊網站。

	它將車輛外部區分為十八種、内部區分為十二種。它也會將包含車輛的相片、但並非銷售對象的圖像（如廣告）區分出來。甚至還能鎖定某品牌、車名、款式，顯示平均銷售價格帶。

	「konpeki（紺碧）」系統的開發便是採用了谷歌的「谷歌雲端平台（GCP）」上為了開發深度學習模型的程式庫「開源機器學習系統（Tensor Flow）」、讓機器學習大量圖像資料而成。

	■ 以少量的訓練資料構築出車輛台數檢測的系統

	Aerosense與大數據的BrainPad公司共同合作、運用了深度學習技術的作法。開發了從空拍圖像中測出停車車輛數的系統。先從實驗結果來看的話，使用了深度學習的空拍圖辨識汽車模型，在顯示了一百一十六輛汽車的測試圖資料中，測岀結果為一百二十二輛。

	Aerosense的汽車辨識模型，其特點在於其從空拍圖辨識汽車用的深度學習模型，並非是從零開始打造的。研發人員說明：「若要製作專用的模型，將需要大量的訓練資料。即使有一萬張也不夠吧！這次是運用了現有的模型，大約只有一百三十張的少量訓練資料，就顯示出其高精確度，很有價值。」

	在深度學習模型的開發上，活用了谷歌的深度學習程式庫「TensorFlow」。利用TensorFlow中名為「Inception-V3」之一般圖像辨識模型，從圖像資料中製作抽取了特徵值的向量。此時，使用約一百三十張的汽車空拍照作為訓練資料。抽取了特徵值的向量，再以一種名為SVM（支援向量機；Support Vector Machine）的機器學習進行學習，得出結果。

結合500家企業的導入經驗，系統化說明著手運用深度學習的方法

	作者輔導了500家以上企業導入深度學習於工作之中，他用資料×目的的矩陣，描繪出活用展望圖，協助讀者理清頭緒，讓公司縮短導入摸索的時間。

This book offers a comprehensive guide to implementing SAP and HANA on private, public and hybrid clouds. Cloud computing has transformed the way organizations run their IT infrastructures: the shift from legacy monolithic mainframes and UNIX platforms to cloud based infrastructures offering ubiquitous access to critical information, elastic provisioning and drastic cost savings has made cloud an essential part of every organization's business strategy. Cloud based services have evolved from simple file sharing, email and messaging utilities in the past, to the current situation, where their improved technical capabilities and SLAs make running mission-critical applications such as SAP possible. However, IT professionals must take due care when deploying SAP in a public, private or hybrid cloud environment. As a foundation for core business operations, SAP cloud deployments must satisfy stringent requirements concerning their performance, scale and security, while delivering measurable improvements in IT efficiency and cost savings. The 2nd edition of ""SAP on the Cloud"" continues the work of its successful predecessor released in 2013, providing updated guidance for deploying SAP in public, private and hybrid clouds. To do so, it discusses the technical requirements and considerations necessary for IT professionals to successfully implement SAP software in a cloud environment, including best-practice architectures for IaaS, PaaS and SaaS deployments. The section on SAP's in-memory database HANA has been significantly extended to cover Suite on HANA (SoH) and the different incarnations of HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC) and Tailored Datacenter Integration (TDI). As cyber threats are a significant concern, it also explores appropriate security models for defending SAP cloud deployments against modern and sophisticated attacks. The reader will gain the insights needed to understand the respective benefits and drawbacks of various deployment models and how SAP on the cloud can be used to deliver IT efficiency and cost-savings in a secure and agile manner.

The militarized legacy of the digital cloud: how the cloud grew out of older network technologies and politics.We may imagine the digital cloud as placeless, mute, ethereal, and unmediated. Yet the reality of the cloud is embodied in thousands of massive data centers, any one of which can use as much electricity as a midsized town. Even all these data centers are only one small part of the cloud. Behind that cloud-shaped icon on our screens is a whole universe of technologies and cultural norms, all working to keep us from noticing their existence. In this book, Tung-Hui Hu examines the gap between the real and the virtual in our understanding of the cloud. Hu shows that the cloud grew out of such older networks as railroad tracks, sewer lines, and television circuits. He describes key moments in the prehistory of the cloud, from the game ""Spacewar"" as exemplar of time-sharing computers to Cold War bunkers that were later reused as data centers. Countering the popular perception of a new ""cloudlike"" political power that is dispersed and immaterial, Hu argues that the cloud grafts digital technologies onto older ways of exerting power over a population. But because we invest the cloud with cultural fantasies about security and participation, we fail to recognize its militarized origins and ideology. Moving between the materiality of the technology itself and its cultural rhetoric, Hu's account offers a set of new tools for rethinking the contemporary digital environment.

Why cloud computing represents a paradigm shift for business, and how business users can best take advantage of cloud services.Most of the information available on cloud computing is either highly technical, with details that are irrelevant to non-technologists, or pure marketing hype, in which the cloud is simply a selling point. This book, however, explains the cloud from the user's viewpoint--the business user's in particular. Nayan Ruparelia explains what the cloud is, when to use it (and when not to), how to select a cloud service, how to integrate it with other technologies, and what the best practices are for using cloud computing. Cutting through the hype, Ruparelia cites the simple and basic definition of cloud computing from the National Institute of Science and Technology: a model enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Thus with cloud computing, businesses can harness information technology resources usually available only to large enterprises. And this, Ruparelia demonstrates, represents a paradigm shift for business. It will ease funding for startups, alter business plans, and allow big businesses greater agility. Ruparelia discusses the key issues for any organization considering cloud computing: service level agreements, business service delivery and consumption, finance, legal jurisdiction, security, and social responsibility. He introduces novel concepts made possible by cloud computing: cloud cells, or specialist clouds for specific uses; the personal cloud; the cloud of things; and cloud service exchanges. He examines use case patterns in terms of infrastructure and platform, software information, and business process; and he explains how to transition to a cloud service. Current and future users will find this book an indispensable guide to the cloud.

Meant to be read aloud around campfires, especially to people who think only rich people or rednecks ride horses, Prechtel credits both his own physical and spiritual survival in ""modernity's mad rush to nowhere"" with the sanity of riding and living with his Southwestern horses. These little horses took him flying over ravines into deep-mountain Holy places, backwards over streams, into churches--mounted--to win a bet by kissing antagonistic preachers on the pulpit, and in general keeping alive an older spirit in an age where horses have been sadly removed from our own everyday lives after three millennia as the closest companions of our ancestors' dreams and mythologies. If you want to have good memory, you have to do things that are worth remembering. Time to get busy!

Despite the buzz surrounding the cloud computing, only a small percentage of organizations have actually deployed this new style of IT--so far. If you're planning your long-term cloud strategy, this practical book provides insider knowledge and actionable real-world lessons regarding planning, design, operations, security, and application transformation. This book teaches business and technology managers how to transition their organization's traditional IT to cloud computing.

Author James Bond provides useful guidance and best-practice checklists based on his field experience with real customers and cloud providers. You'll view cloud services from the perspective of a consumer and as an owner/operator of an enterprise private or hybrid cloud, and learn valuable lessons from successful and less-than-successful organization use-case scenarios.

◎應用數學權威理性解析演算法與社會，讓我們對演算法不再害怕的第一本書

◎資訊社會學專家曹家榮（世新大學社會心理學系助理教授）專文導讀

 

從選餐廳到選總統，演算法正全面影響我們的生活？

Facebook和劍橋分析公司分享用戶個資，讓演算法操弄人心？

Google的搜尋演算法暗藏性別與種族歧視？

 

讓應用數學權威帶我們一一解答以上的問題。

		 

		　　我們對科技與網路的仰賴有如開了一扇窗，讓數學家和資料研究者得以窺探我們的生活。他們不斷蒐集資料，了解我們去哪裡旅行、上哪裡購物、買些什麼、對什麼感興趣，進而預測我們的生活習慣。有些人甚至宣稱，這些資料就足以操弄人心、改變國家輿論。但這些資料到底多可靠？唯有了解數學做得到和做不到什麼，才能明白演算法正如何改變我們的生活。

		 

演算法到底能多了解我們？

		2018年Facebook爆出與劍橋分析公司分享用戶個資的事件。劍橋分析公司宣稱，他們能從資料中分析出個人的政治傾向，以針對這些人投放量身打造的競選宣傳。然而這些劍橋分析公司取得的資料，真的能讓他們做成一個完整的「人格分析」演算法嗎？另外，Google引以為傲的搜尋演算規則，是否會擴大我們的偏見，讓我們「學會」歧視？

		 

了解演算法，不必再對科技擔心受怕

		　　演算法和操弄人心的恐慌正在蔓延，而本書作者帶領我們遍觀各種演算法，看見數學不為人知的一面。藉由訪問走在演算法研究最前端的科學家並自己做數學實驗分析佐證，作者除了解釋數學與統計如何運用於現實生活，也說明了現今社群演算法的能力與極限，讓我們更了解現今的網路服務是如何影響我們。

 Google是目前公認最好的雲端服務提供者，我們不僅可以利用Google的雲端硬碟存放工具，還可以利用Google本身以及許多廠商提供的外掛軟體，來強化我們的各種辦公應用。

 你絕對沒想到Google可以幫你這麼多！

 我們一般都以為Google服務只是能夠免費使用信箱、看看地圖、查查想要的資料，其實在現在行動裝置如此普及的環境下，Google還有更多非常實用的雲端服務，可以幫助我們提升工作效能。例如：

 出差途中忘記攜帶檔案了嗎？

About the Technical Reviewer ? Rob Drimmie is a software developer with a bias toward web-based applications. The best things about him are his wife and children. He likes pho and hamburgers but has never eaten both at the same sitting. xiv ? INTRODUCTION Acknowledgments First of all, I would like to thank my beloved fianc矇e, Petronella Frisk, for putting up with me spending evenings and weekends writing this book. Thank you for your patience and support! I couldn't have done it without you! Many thanks to Tom Skinner for helping me with the initial reviews of the chapters and with testing the examples. Your help has been immensly valuable to me. If not for you, the book would have been a lot poorer. I would also like to thank you for your words of encouragement at the times when I needed it the most. Also thanks to Charlie Irish, who helped proofread Chapter 5, before I used it as a beta chapter. My former college Chris Jangel繹v has been a source of inspiration over the years. I probably owe it to him that I entered into the world of web standards, usability, and blogging in the first place. Thank you, Chris, for always having new ideas and being encouraging.

Cloud Computing Explained provides an overview of Cloud Computing in an enterprise environment. There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm around cloud-based solutions and services as well as the cost-savings and flexibility that they can provide. It is imperative that all senior technologists have a solid understanding of the ramifications of cloud computing since its impact is likely to permeate the entire IT landscape. However, it is not trivial to introduce a fundamentally different service-delivery paradigm into an existing enterprise architecture. This book describes the benefits and challenges of Cloud Computing and then leads the reader through the process of assessing the suitability of a cloud-based approach for a given situation, calculating and justifying the investment that is required to transform the process or application, and then developing a solid design that considers the implementation as well as the ongoing operations and governance required to maintain the solution in a partially outsourced delivery model.

Over the last couple of years, we've noticed that our customers have gotten more demanding when it comes to the usability of their web applications. Inspired by the ""web 2.0"" trend and applications such as Gmail and the like, we've tried many approaches to building these rich Internet applications (RIAs). But all of these had one big flaw: they required us to learn a different language, including adhering to a whole new set of conventions and best practices. Only with the introduction of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) have we begun to feel confident about building this kind of application in a maintainable fashion. This book introduces GWT within the context just described, and will guide you through the first steps of using it to build real-world applications. The goal is to get you as a Java developer up to speed quickly by providing just enough background and a lot of hands-on code samples. During the course of the book, we'll guide you through the different aspects of GWT that we feel are important, and leave out the ones we feel are out-of-scope for beginners. Most of the code samples will gradually build to make up a real-world sample application that allows you to manage your tasks using a web application. After reading this book, you'll be equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to start building real-world applications using GWT.

Google.com is one of the most popular sites on the Internet and is used around the world by millions of people every day. Sure, you know how to ""Google it"" when you're searching for something--anything!--on the Web. It's plenty fast and easy to use. But did you know how much more you could achieve with the world's best search engine by clicking beyond the ""Google Search"" button?  While you can interface with Google in 97 languages and glean results in 35, you can't find any kind of instruction manual from Google. Lucky for you, our fully updated and greatly expanded second edition to the bestselling Google: The Missing Manual covers everything you could possibly want to know about Google, including the newest and coolest--and often most underused (what is Froogle, anyway?)--features. There's even a full chapter devoted to Gmail, Google's free email service that includes a whopping 2.5 GB of space).  This wise and witty guide delivers the complete scoop on Google, from how it works to how you can search far more effectively and efficiently (no more scrolling through 168 pages of seemingly irrelevant results); take best advantage of Google's lesser-known features, such as Google Print, Google Desktop, and Google Suggest; get your website listed on Google; track your visitors with Google Analytics; make money with AdWords and AdSense; and much more.  Whether you're new to Google or already a many-times-a-day user, you're sure to find tutorials, tips, tricks, and tools that take you well beyond simple search to Google gurudom.

What Is This Book About? This is a book about Web Services. Web Services are still more like a movement than a mature technology. The movement is motivated by a vision of a semi-auto- mated Web that can support long chains of interactions between autonomous agents. There are three important components to that vision. One is interoperabil- ity: a service can have clients (agents) from any platform, in any language. Another is autonomy: an agent can discover the services it needs from their published descriptions that include both what the service can do and how it does it (the interfaces of available actions). The third is (semi) automatic code creation: one description can be used by a development framework to automate the creation of code for clients and by the services themselves. As of today, interoperability is close to full realization, with only occasional glitches; autonomy is a distant vision; but it still has problems. Interoperability has been achieved code creation is useful in part by using an XML-based high-level protocol (SOAP) for message exchanges between clients and services. As long as the client can produce messages in the right format, it doesn't matter what language they're written in or on what platform they run. The first three chapters of our book show how to write platform-independent Web Services clients in Javascript and Java running from within a browser (IE6 or Mozilla).

In the tradition of The Sense of Wonder by Rachel Carson and On the Loose by Terry and Renny Russell, Earth & Eros combines words and photographs to inspire readers to deepen their connection with the good Earth. The book awakens readers to the full force of eros -- life force that connects us to our bodies, other humans, all living beings, and the Earth as a living being. Intended as an antidote to an age obsessed by speed, screens, and machines, this book brings together previously published prose and poetry with 25 fine art landscape photographs to explore the sacred erotic dimension of humans' relationship to the Earth. The writings in Earth & Eros were chosen for their brevity, readability, beauty, and potency, and the photographs for their sensuality. Readers engage with writers such as David James Duncan, Hart Crane, Diane Ackerman, Sherman Alexie, D. H. Lawrence, Mary Oliver, and Pablo Neruda. Some of the pieces of writing are explicitly sexual, while others appreciate the sensuality of tree limbs, seeping water, mushrooms, and ferns. Earth and Eros is beautifully produced and a pleasure to hold and to look at, a book to read and reread slowly, out loud.

Today, an interdisciplinary and international group of scientists, inventors, and engineers are turning to nature to find elegant solutions to human problems. The principle driving this transformation is called biomimicry, and Harman shares a wide range of examples of how we're borrowing from natural models to invent profitable, green solutions to pressing industrial challenges. Aimed at a business audience, aspiring entrepreneurs, environmentalists, and general science readers, The Shark's Paintbrush reflects a force of change in the new global economy that does more than simply gratify human industrial ambition; it teaches us how to live in harmony with nature and opens bright opportunities for a better future.

Why does the bumblebee have better aerodynamics than a 747? What structural design is shared by a tornado and a blood vessel? Since the Industrial Revolution, manufacturers have built things by a process known as ""heat, beat, and treat."" They use enormous amounts of energy to heat raw material, shape it with heavy machinery, and maintain its design, strength, and durability with toxic chemicals. Now, in a world of depleted natural resources, entrepreneurs and scientists are turning to nature to inspire future products that are more energy- and cost-efficient. Biomimicry, the science of employing nature to advance sustainable technology, is arguably one of the hottest new business concepts. At the center of this growing movement has been award-winning inventor and biomimetic entrepreneur Jay Harman. In The Shark's Paintbrush,  Harman introduces us to pioneering engineers in a wide array of businesses who are uncovering and copying nature's hidden marvels. He shows business leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs how we can reconcile creating more powerful, lucrative technologies with maximizing sustainability. He injects a whole new vocabulary and way of thinking into the business sphere that speaks to both small start-ups and corporate giants.

Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers. Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters--the Googleplex--to show how Google works.  While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google's earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.  The key to Google's success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers--free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses--and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.  But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?  No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.
