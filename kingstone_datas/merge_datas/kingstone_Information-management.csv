Nowadays, sufficient amount of information is created within the frameworks of enterprises. It's necessary that this information be preserved in a most effective way, processed and put into meaningful practice in order to achieve effective business and institutional decisions. Consequently, those enterprises which aim at making effective decisions, sharing their knowledge and facilitating the use of information, need institutional portal solutions. Enterprises and Institutions with the aid of information management aim to realize their goals through collecting, editing and documenting the information they have in order to enable right people to access it at the right time and right place. This book covers what enterprise level system information management is, its development and importance. Furthermore, considering all these issues, it includes deductions related to enterprise information management, solution proposals with the help of an information management application, web portal with case study of National Open University of Nigeria. In this respect, this book aims to demonstrate the use and importance of web portal in enterprise level system information management.
