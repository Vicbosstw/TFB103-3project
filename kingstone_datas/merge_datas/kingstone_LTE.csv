NB-IoT is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology used for cellular communication. NB-IoT devices deliver much better capability and performance, such as: increased area coverage of up to one kilometer; a massive number of devices--up to 200,000--per a single base-station area; longer battery lifetime of ten years; and better indoor and outdoor coverage for areas with weak signal, such as underground garages.  The cellular NB-IoT technology is a challenging technology to use and understand. With more than 30 projects presented in this book, covering many use cases and scenarios, this book provides hands-on and practical experience of how to use the cellular NB-IoT for smart applications using Arduino(TM), Amazon Cloud, Google Maps, and charts.  The book starts by explaining AT commands used to configure the NB-IoT modem; data serialization and deserialization; how to set up the cloud for connecting NB-IoT devices; setting up rules, policy, security certificates, and a NoSQL database on the cloud; how to store and read data in the cloud; how to use Google Maps to visualize NB-IoT device geo-location; and how to use charts to visualize sensor datasets.  Projects for Arduino are presented in four parts. The first part explains how to connect the device to the mobile operator and cellular network; perform communication using different network protocols, such as TCP, HTTP, SSL, or MQTT; how to use GPS for geo-location applications; and how to upgrade NB-IoT modem firmware over the air. The second part explains the microcontroller unit and how to build and run projects, such as a 7-segment display or a real-time clock. The third part explains how NB-IoT can be used with sensor devices, such as ultrasonic and environmental sensors. Finally, the fourth part explains how NB-IoT can be used to control actuators, such as stepper motors and relays.  This book is a unique resource for understanding practical uses of the NB-IoT technology and serves as a handbook for technical and non-technical readers who are looking for practicing and exercising the cellular NB-IoT technology. The book can be used by engineers, students, researchers, system integrators, mobile operators' technical staff, and electronics enthusiasts.

Performance Analysis of Long Term Evolution (LTE) Physical Layer,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011122327?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=LTE&pi=0,"Iraj S,Amiri",Createspace Independent Publishi,9781727515503,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5503/9781727515503.jpg,"

In recent years, mobile communication has been evolving rapidly, and demand for fast, secure and higher quality mobile services has increased dramatically. Thus, mobile communication service providers have been trying many different digital mobile communication standards to fulfill their customers' demands. During the last few years, major service providers have committed to a single standard known as Long Term Evolution (LTE), and within a very short period LTE has emerged as the fourth generation network choice for almost all mobile service providers. 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution), which is one of the latest standards for mobile communications, was proposed by a cooperation between groups of telecommunications consortium named as 3rd Generation Partnership Project to improve the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) mobile phone standard to meet the demands and ensure the coping with future technology evolutions. This technology describes a mobile communication standard which supports up to 300 Mbps of data transmission in downlink using the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing scheme as well as up to 75 Mbps throughput for uplink using the SC-FDMA modulation. In this dissertation, an in-depth study of LTE performance evaluation is conducted for downlink transmission under different scenarios. The focus of this book is a comprehensive analysis of LTE physical layer performance for different channel bandwidths, antenna diversities, modulation schemes and other scenarios. In addition, this study presents Bit Error Rate (BER), Block Error Rate (BLER) and throughput results based on different parameters. Overall, this book provides a comprehensive investigation of the LTE performance analysis based on detailed physical layer parameters to fill in the gap in the existing literature in LTE physical layer performance study.

In Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system, multi-access interference coordination has been planned to optimize the exploitation of radio resources, thus maximizing service quality, coverage and capacity. Many techniques aim to minimize inter-cell interference in LTE, such as fractional power control and spatial antenna techniques, including MIMO and SDMA. In LTE, the access technique rests on the OFDM modulation technique. The allocation of resources takes place both in time and frequency. These resources are allocated to user equipment according to a given frequency reuse approach.

In this book, three different methods are presented to enhance the capacity and coverage area in LTE-A cellular networks. The scope involves the evaluation of the effect of the RN location in terms of capacity and the determination of the optimum location of the relay that provides maximum achievable data rate for users with limited interference at the cell boundaries. This book presents a new model to enhance both capacity and coverage area in LTE-A cellular network by determining the optimum location for the RN with limited interference. The new model is designed to enhance the capacity of the relay link by employing two antennas in RN. This design enables the relay link to absorb more users at cell edge regions. An algorithm called the Balance Power Algorithm (BPA) is developed to reduce MR power consumption. The book pertains to postgraduate students and researchers in wireless & mobile communications.

This book introduces the Vienna Simulator Suite for 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compatible Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) simulators and presents applications to demonstrate their uses for describing, designing, and optimizing wireless cellular LTE-A networks.Part One addresses LTE and LTE-A link level techniques. As there has been high demand for the downlink (DL) simulator, it constitutes the central focus of the majority of the chapters. This part of the book reports on relevant highlights, including single-user (SU), multi-user (MU) and single-input-single-output (SISO) as well as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions. Furthermore, it summarizes the optimal pilot pattern for high-speed communications as well as different synchronization issues. One chapter is devoted to experiments that show how the link level simulator can provide input to a testbed. This section also uses measurements to present and validate fundamental results on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions that are not limited to LTE-A. One chapter exclusively deals with the newest tool, the uplink (UL) link level simulator, and presents cutting-edge results.In turn, Part Two focuses on system-level simulations. From early on, system-level simulations have been in high demand, as people are naturally seeking answers when scenarios with numerous base stations and hundreds of users are investigated. This part not only explains how mathematical abstraction can be employed to speed up simulations by several hundred times without sacrificing precision, but also illustrates new theories on how to abstract large urban heterogeneous networks with indoor small cells. It also reports on advanced applications such as train and car transmissions to demonstrate the tools' capabilities.
