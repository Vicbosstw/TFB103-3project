This book focuses on the modeling, optimization, and applications of 5G green mobile communication networks, aimed at improving energy efficiency and spectrum utilization in 5G systems. It offers a balance between theoretical analysis and engineering practice, providing in-depth studies of a number of major topics, such as energy consumption models, optimization, system design, implementation, and performance evaluation. It also discusses four aspects of green communication in detail: cellular networks, resource management, wireless transmissions and multi-media communications. Further, this unique book comprehensively and systematically discusses green optimization in wireless mobile communications. As such it is a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and graduate students in various fields, including telecommunications engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, and computer engineering, particularly those interested in green communications.

Spectral Efficiency of Next Generation Mobile Communication Systems,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011381070?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Mobile-communication&pi=0,"Laurits,Hamm",AV Akademikerverlag,9783639438659,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8659/9783639438659.jpg,"

Revision with unchanged content. Future mobile communication systems have to provide high data rates for multimedia services. The radio spectrum is a natural and scarce resource and therefore spectral efficiency is the most essential factor for future systems. This work investigates the spectral efficiency of the next generation cellular system WINNER. The focus is on multihop relay enhanced cell deployments as well as multicast and broadcast transmission. To develop realistic deploy-ments, quality of service constraints from the user and deployment con-straints from the operator side are considered. The investigations are part of the European research project WINNER and results are presented in this context. The first part introduces the WINNER wide area deployment. Further, solutions for relay enhanced cell deployments and for multicast and broadcast transmission are developed. System-level simulations are used to evaluate the proposed deployments. Final results for both parts and combined solutions are presented. This book addresses engineers and researchers working in the field of wireless and mobile communications.
