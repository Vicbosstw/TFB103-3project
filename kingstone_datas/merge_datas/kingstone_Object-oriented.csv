A comprehensive guide to exploring modern Python through data structures, design patterns, and effective object-oriented techniquesKey Features: Build an intuitive understanding of object-oriented design, from introductory to mature programs Learn the ins and outs of Python syntax, libraries, and best practices Examine a machine-learning case study at the end of each chapterBook Description: Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a friendly, comprehensive tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. UML class diagrams are generously used throughout the text for you to understand class relationships. Beyond the book's focus on OOP, it features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced in this book. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs.What You Will Learn: Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methodsExtend class functionality using inheritanceUse exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanlyUnderstand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use themDiscover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in PythonUncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so importantLearn to statically type check your dynamic codeUnderstand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programsWho this book is for: If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.

Discovering Identical Frequent Sub-Graphs in Object-Oriented Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108662539?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Object-oriented&pi=0,"Appala Srinuvasu,Muttipati",Ingram      ,9786203472646,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/2646/9786203472646.jpg,"

This book describes the identification of Subgraphs in the Object-Oriented Design using a Closed subgraph mining Algorithm. Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) allows to leverage the best practices and principles, thus reduces a human effort for reinventing new design. Further, understanding a software design is not an easy task, it requires a lot of domain and a deep understanding of OOP principles. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify similar design structures in a group.Further, for large object-oriented systems, it is difficult to understand the functionalities because of their topological and behavioral complexity. It is even more difficult to extend or modify an existing design, which can be error-prone and can even lead to poor quality of software. Developers who work with software systems tend to break large and complex systems into smaller sub-components. Therefore, this research work proposes a partitioning based graph mining approach to discover frequent identical design patterns in an object-oriented design model.

Do modern programming languages, IDEs, and libraries make coding easy? Maybe, but coding is not design. Large-scale or expensive apps clearly require evaluation of design choices. Still, software design directly impacts code reuse and longevity even for small-scale apps with limited overhead. This text evaluates and contrasts common object-oriented designs. A given problem may have many solutions. A developer may employ different design techniques - composition, inheritance, dependency injection, delegation, etc. - to solve a particular problem. A skilled developer can determine the costs and benefits of different design responses, even amid competing concerns. A responsible developer documents design choices as a contract with the client, delineating external and internal responsibilities. To promote effective software design, this book examines contractual, object-oriented designs for immediate and sustained use as well as code reuse. The intent of identifying design variants is to recognize and manage conflicting goals such as short versus long-term utility, stability versus flexibility, and storage versus computation. Many examples are given to evaluate and contrast different solutions and to compare C# and C++ effects. No one has a crystal ball; however, deliberate design promotes software longevity. With the prominence of legacy OO code, a clear understanding of different object-oriented designs is essential. Design questions abound. Is code reuse better with inheritance or composition? Should composition rely on complete encapsulation? Design choices impact flexibility, efficiency, stability, longevity, and reuse, yet compilers do not enforce design and syntax does not necessarily illustrate design. Through deliberate design, or redesign when refactoring, developers construct sustainable, efficient code.

Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.

Object-Oriented Design for Temporal GIS,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200903008?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Object-oriented&pi=0,"Monica,Wachowicz",CRC Press,9780367579173,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9173/9780367579173.jpg,"

There has been an increasing demand in GIS for systems that support historical data: time-series data as well as mobility information. From a modelling perspective, there are advantages in integrating object-oriented analysis and design to databases as well as to visualisation capabilities of GIS.Object-Oriented Design for Temporal GIS explores the major components of the object-oriented analysis and design methods, how they can be used for modelling spatio-temporal data, and how these components are developed and maintained within a GIS. It also offers practical guidance to object-oriented methods by demonstrating the feasibility of applying such methods to issues involved in handling spatio-temporal data. The author demonstrates how this knowledge might be used in a wide range of applications such as political boundary record maintenance (historical data), disease incidence rate analysis in epidemics (diffusion rate), and environmental studies of climate change (time-series data). This understanding contributes to the development of theory in GIS and improves the design of GIS to support the modelling of semantics, space and time elements of geographical information.

Change Proness of Metrics and Classes in Object-Oriented Systems,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011451667?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Object-oriented&pi=0,"Amandeep,Kaur",LAP Lambert Academic Publishing,9786200311009,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1009/9786200311009.jpg,"

Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) is a software engineering approach that models a system as a group of interacting objects. Each object represents some entity of interest in the system being modeled and is characterized by its class, its state (data elements), and its behavior. Various models can be created to show the static structure, dynamic behavior, and run-time deployment of these collaborating objects. In OOAD the boundary between analysis and design is blurred. One reason for this blurring is the similarity of basic constructs (i.e., objects and classes) that are used in analysis and design. The fundamental difference between OOA and OOD is that OOA models the problem domain, leading to an understanding and specification of the problem, while OOD models the solution to the problem. That is analysis deal with the problem domain, while design deals with the solution domain. However, in OOAD it is believed that the problem domain representation created by OOA is generally subsumed in the solution domain representation. That is, the solution domain representation, created by OOD, generally contains much of the representation created by OOA.

My first experiments with object-oriented programming in PHP took place about six years ago. Unfortunately, the book that introduced me to the subject concentrated on the mechanics of writing classes and paid little heed to principles underlying OOP. As a result, I wrote classes that were closely intertwined with a specific project (""tightly coupled,"" to use the OOP terminology). Everything worked exactly the way I wanted, but the design had a fundamental flaw: the classes couldn't be used for any other project. Worse still, it was a large project--a bilingual, searchable database with more than 15,000 records--so any changes I wanted to make to it involved revising the whole code base. The purpose of this book is to help you avoid the same mistake. Although most chapters revolve around mini-projects, the classes they use are project-neutral. Rather than being a ""how to"" cookbook, the aim is to help developers with a solid knowledge of PHP basics add OOP to their skill set.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is something that is usually considered a black art for hardcore programmers, not a topic of conversation for Flash developers. However, when adobe introduced ActionScript 3.0 to the mix, it changed everything. ActionScript 3.0 is much more powerful than previous versions, allowing Flash developers to produce robust object-oriented applications. But with that power comes great responsibility--OOP is now a requirement, rather than optional, and there are new things to learn. This book, based on the ever-popular Object-Oriented ActionScript for Flash 8, provides you all you need to delve into the world of OOP with confidence, whether you are using the Flash IDE, Flex builder, or even command-line tools for your development work. First, you are taken gently through all the principles of OOP that you need to know, and then given a guide to designing and implementing applications in ActionScript 3.0. Next, we step up a gear, showing you the Flex builder development environment and teaching about creating reusable, extensible component frameworks, manager classes, animation and effects classes, UI widgets, and more. lastly, we look at some more advanced topics such as communication between Flash and the browser and Web services. case studies are included that apply the knowledge presented, giving you real-world projects to learn from and adapt for use in your own work. Mastering object-oriented programming is essential for modern Flash development, and Object-Oriented ActionScript 3.0 is the only guide you'll need.

If there's one thing I've learned as a developer, it's this: Complexity happens; simplicity, you have to consistently strive for. Nowhere is this truer than in education. Our role as teachers, by definition, is to simplify subjects so that they can be easily understood. A good teacher dispels trepidation with anecdote, abstraction with analogy, superstition and magic with knowledge. Simplicity, however, is not easily attained. In order to simplify, you must first gain an enc- passing understanding of the complex. It is a rare person who can simultaneously exist in both the simple and complex plains of a problem domain and communicate effectively at both levels. It is, however, these rare people who make the best teachers. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a subject that many Flash developers do not approach due to a widespread erroneous perception of its enormous scope and complexity. Nothing could be further from the truth. The core concepts behind OOP are simple enough for a primary school student with a p- ticularly nasty case of Hynerian flu to understand in a single sitting.

As you work your way through 聶An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET聶, you'll learn how to analyze the business requirements of an application, model the objects and relationships involved in the solution design, and, finally, implement the solution using Visual Basic .NET. Along the way you'll also learn the fundamentals of software design, the Unified Modeling Language, object-oriented programming, and Visual Basic .NET. 聶An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET聶 is logically organized into three parts. Part One delves into object-oriented programming methodology and design--concepts that transcend a particular programming language. The concepts presented are important to the success of an object-oriented programming solution regardless of the implementation language chosen. At the conclusion of this part, a case study walks you through the design of a solution based on a real-world scenario. Part Two looks at how object-oriented programming is implemented in Visual Basic .NET. You will explore the structure of classes, class hierarchies, inheritance, and interfaces. The .NET Framework is introduced along with the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment. Part Three returns to the case study introduced at the end of Part One. Using the knowledge gained in Part Two, programmers will transform the design into a functional VB .NET application. The application includes a graphical user interface, a business logic class library, and integration with a backend database.

One of the most significant features of Visual Basic .NET is the full support of object-oriented programming. For years, developers have been asking for it, but you may not be quite sure how it can help to create and maintain scalable .NET applications. VB.NET is a language that facilitates object-oriented programming, but does not guarantee good object-oriented code. That's where Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET comes in. It will show you how to think about similarities in your application logic and how to design and create objects that maximize the benefit and power the .NET Framework enables.The concept of separating the interface from the implementation has been around for years, but with Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET you'll put it all into practice and you'll never willingly go back to those old ways. With chapters on object fundamentals and class anatomy, you'll lay a foundation that will prepare you to think and apply code reuse principles. Following that, you'll be ready to dive deep into code and the dynamic ecology that it interacts with. Inheritance, containment, polymorphism, overloading, and overriding are just the beginning of this adventure. From there, you'll discover exception handling, reflection, serialization, and I/O.Packed with examples that will guide you through every step, Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET is a guide for those with some programming experience. This book is for those who know Visual Basic 6.0 and are ready or have started the process of developing with Visual Basic .NET. It is an essential tool that will build your skills, as you become a master of Visual Basic .NET.It is one thing to know how to write object-oriented code. Knowing the when and the why is what makes good programmers. That's exactly what you'll know after reading this book.

 Sams Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming in 21 Days differs from other OOP books in two main ways. Many classic OOP books are designed for software engineers and teach at an academic level. Sams Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming in 21 Days presents accessible, user-friendly lessons designed with the beginning programmer in mind. Other OOP books work to present both OOP and to teach a programming language (for example: Object-Oriented Programming in C++). Although Sams Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming in 21 Days uses Java to present the examples, the book is designed to present concepts that apply to any OOP environment.
