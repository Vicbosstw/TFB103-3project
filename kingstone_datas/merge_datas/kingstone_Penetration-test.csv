Optimal Penetration of Distributed Generations in Distribution Network,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c106328880?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Penetration-test&pi=0,"Amandeep,Gill",Ingram      ,9786203307719.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7719/9786203307719.jpg,"

There is a need to increase the distributed generation (DGs) penetration into the distribution network to meet the increasing energy consumption. Line/Power losses and voltage profile maintenance are the most significant restrictions of the existing power system. Random DGs penetration also causes many problems in the distribution system like system islanding, relay tripping, reverse power flow, etc. To avoid such issues, to reduce power losses and to enhance voltage profile penetration of optimal sized distributed generations at optimal locations in the distribution network is required. These distribution networks will be the IEEE 33 bus and IEEE 69 bus radial distribution networks. Adaptive schemes based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, biogeography based optimization and particle swarm optimization techniques will do this optimal sizing and penetration of DGs for minimizing the power loss, enhancing the voltage profile and fitness rate.

Build a better defense against motivated, organized, professional attacks Advanced Penetration Testing: Hacking the World's Most Secure Networks takes hacking far beyond Kali linux and Metasploit to provide a more complex attack simulation. Featuring techniques not taught in any certification prep or covered by common defensive scanners, this book integrates social engineering, programming, and vulnerability exploits into a multidisciplinary approach for targeting and compromising high security environments. From discovering and creating attack vectors, and moving unseen through a target enterprise, to establishing command and exfiltrating data--even from organizations without a direct Internet connection--this guide contains the crucial techniques that provide a more accurate picture of your system's defense. Custom coding examples use VBA, Windows Scripting Host, C, Java, JavaScript, Flash, and more, with coverage of standard library applications and the use of scanning tools to bypass common defensive measures. Typical penetration testing consists of low-level hackers attacking a system with a list of known vulnerabilities, and defenders preventing those hacks using an equally well-known list of defensive scans. The professional hackers and nation states on the forefront of today's threats operate at a much more complex level--and this book shows you how to defend your high security network.  Use targeted social engineering pretexts to create the initial compromise Leave a command and control structure in place for long-term access Escalate privilege and breach networks, operating systems, and trust structures Infiltrate further using harvested credentials while expanding control  Today's threats are organized, professionally-run, and very much for-profit. Financial institutions, health care organizations, law enforcement, government agencies, and other high-value targets need to harden their IT infrastructure and human capital against targeted advanced attacks from motivated professionals. Advanced Penetration Testing goes beyond Kali linux and Metasploit and to provide you advanced pen testing for high security networks.

Originally, the term ""hacker"" referred to a programmer who was skilled in computer operating systems and machine code. Today, it refers to anyone who performs hacking activities. Hacking is the act of changing a system's features to attain a goal that is not within the original purpose of the creator. The word ""hacking"" is usually perceived negatively especially by people who do not understand the job of an ethical hacker. In the hacking world, ethical hackers are good guys. What is their role? They use their vast knowledge of computers for good instead of malicious reasons. They look for vulnerabilities in the computer security of organizations and businesses to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of them. For someone that loves the world of technology and computers, it would be wise to consider an ethical hacking career. You get paid (a good amount) to break into systems. Getting started will not be a walk in the park--just as with any other career. However, if you are determined, you can skyrocket yourself into a lucrative career. When you decide to get started on this journey, you will have to cultivate patience. The first step for many people is usually to get a degree in computer science. You can also get an A+ certification (CompTIA)--you must take and clear two different exams. To be able to take the qualification test, you need to have not less than 500 hours of experience in practical computing. Experience is required, and a CCNA or Network+ qualification to advance your career. This book should be your start into the world of ethical hacking.

Simulating Information Retrieval Test Collections,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c103909046?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Penetration-test&pi=1,"David,Hawking",Ingram      ,9781681739571.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9571/9781681739571.jpg,"

Simulated test collections may find application in situations where real datasets cannot easily be accessed due to confidentiality concerns or practical inconvenience. They can potentially support Information Retrieval (IR) experimentation, tuning, validation, performance prediction, and hardware sizing. Naturally, the accuracy and usefulness of results obtained from a simulation depend upon the fidelity and generality of the models which underpin it. The fidelity of emulation of a real corpus is likely to be limited by the requirement that confidential information in the real corpus should not be able to be extracted from the emulated version. We present a range of methods exploring trade-offs between emulation fidelity and degree of preservation of privacy. We present three different simple types of text generator which work at a micro level: Markov models, neural net models, and substitution ciphers. We also describe macro level methods where we can engineer macro properties of a corpus, giving a range of models for each of the salient properties: document length distribution, word frequency distribution (for independent and non-independent cases), word length and textual representation, and corpus growth. We present results of emulating existing corpora and for scaling up corpora by two orders of magnitude. We show that simulated collections generated with relatively simple methods are suitable for some purposes and can be generated very quickly. Indeed it may sometimes be feasible to embed a simple lightweight corpus generator into an indexer for the purpose of efficiency studies. Naturally, a corpus of artificial text cannot support IR experimentation in the absence of a set of compatible queries. We discuss and experiment with published methods for query generation and query log emulation. We present a proof-of-the-pudding study in which we observe the predictive accuracy of efficiency and effectiveness results obtained on emulated versions of TREC corpora. The study includes three open-source retrieval systems and several TREC datasets. There is a trade-off between confidentiality and prediction accuracy and there are interesting interactions between retrieval systems and datasets. Our tentative conclusion is that there are emulation methods which achieve useful prediction accuracy while providing a level of confidentiality adequate for many applications.

This thesis presents two significant results in the field of precision measurements in low-energy nuclear physics. Firstly, it presents a precise half-life determination of 11C, leading to the most precise ft-value for a beta decay transition between mirror nuclides, an important advance in the testing of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Secondly, it describes a high-precision mass measurement of 56Cu, a critical nucleus for determining the path of the astrophysical rapid-proton capture process, performed by the author using the LEBIT Penning trap at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. This new measurement resolves discrepancies in previously-reported calculated mass excesses. In addition, the thesis also presents the construction and testing of a radio-frequency quadrupole cooler and buncher that will be part of the future N = 126 factory at Argonne National Laboratory aimed at producing nuclei of interest for the astrophysical rapid-neutron capture process for the first time.

Water injection is one of the most promising technologies to improve the engine combustion efficiency, by mitigating knock occurrences and controlling exhaust gas temperature before turbine. As result, the engine can operate at stoichiometric conditions over the whole engine map, even during the more power-demanding RDE cycles. Antonino Vacca presents a methodology to study and optimize the effect of water injection for gasoline engines by investigating different engine layouts and injection strategies through the set-up of a 3D-CFD virtual test bench. He investigates indirect and direct water injection strategies to increase the engine knock limit and to reduce exhaust gas temperature for several operating points.

Today, the world's population and biodiversity are exposed to a high level of threat when considering water security. Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnostic studies from the local to the global level. This book provides a broad perspective on the application of the common onion as a warning monitoring system for screening environmental contaminants as an indicator of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The Allium test has been frequently used to determine water quality and ecosystem health as well as a tool to public health purposes in various areas of application. This assay includes macro (root growth) and microscopic (chromosomal aberration in the root tip cells) parameters by cultivating the onion bulb in the liquid sample. Simplicity, low cost and good chromosomal conditions make the Allium test a highly suitable genetic model for assessing biological risks of contaminants with ethical advantages, since the results can be extrapolated to humans. Its remarkable importance in toxicological and ecotoxicological studies increases as ecology emerges as a new integrative discipline, since the quest for human health is the quest for ecology.

Parkinson gear tester is used to test the error in the gear. Here the carriage has two spindle. One main gear is fixed in one spindle and another testing gear is fixed in the second spindle. They can slide both side and these gears are mounted in mesh by spring pressure. When the gear are rotated, the moment of sliding carriage can be measured by the dial indicator. This values are recorded in the recorder. The spindles can be adjusted so that axial distance is equal and scale is attached to one side and vernier to the other side for measure the centre distance. If errors occur in the tooth form moment of carriage due to the error in the pitch and tooth thickness. This moment is indicated in the dial gauge. The maximum gear diameter 150 mm can be tested.

Development and Validation of Mathematics Achievement Test using Rasch,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011373837?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Penetration-test&pi=2,"Taiwo,Aliyu",LAP Lambert Academic Publishing,9783659977947.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7947/9783659977947.jpg,"

This study centres on the development and validation of Mathematics Achievement Test using the Rasch model. The scales used to measure achievement test in Nigeria rely on classical test theory (CTT) approach. As a result of this, they are faced with some challenges like, poor precision, sample dependence and undue focus on aggregate scores that deny test developers the opportunity of determining how the examinees performed on a test item. This problem was overcome with the application of item response theory (IRT) of the Rasch model. Nine research questions and four hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The study was reviewed under both theoretical and empirical study. It is an instrumentation research design which adopted a multistage sampling technique in selecting the 1500 samples used from the adopted states in the study. The instrument consisted of a self developed 150 items and 25 questionnaires on SES. The content validity was examined using the table of specification while face validity was based on some experts' judgment on the development of the items. The reliability value of the items was 0.85.

Public Key Encryption with Equality Test. Construction of Public key Encryption with Equality Test With Provable Security. With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a growing number of users choose to store the data collected from their smart devices on a cloud server for saving costs. However, the security and privacy issues that accompany the cloud-assisted IoT are also becoming increasingly apparent. Considering the untrusted nature of cloud server, the data collected by the smart sensor should be encrypted before being transmitted to the cloud. Nevertheless, the above mechanism raises another serious problem. For users of another public key cryptosystem, it is impractical to download all the data stored in the cloud to find the data they need. Therefore, in this book, we chose the equality test to solve the problem of performing the search functionality on the ciphertext stored in the cloud server without disclosing any information related to these ciphertexts.

Revision with unchanged content. The project is based on the benefits of Design by Contract on testing. If contracts - preconditions, postconditions, class invariants - are systematically associated with classes, they provide an invaluable source of information for producing systematic tests, directly based on the software's expressly intended semantics. The goal of this project is to develop a tool called ""Test Wizard"", which generates test cases automatically from contract-equipped classes. The Test Wizard will serve as a workbench to try out different testing strategies.

Monitoring Fluid-Fluid Interface by Well Test Analysis,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011355523?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Penetration-test&pi=2,"Azunna I B,Ekejiuba",LAP Lambert Academic Publishing,9786200496850.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6850/9786200496850.jpg,"

This project involves the monitoring of fluid-fluid interface by well test analysis in the presence of wellbore storage and skin effects. The study therefore is on the interpretation of well tests data obtained for both short and long duration well tests. The term ""short-duration"" is used herein to indicate either drawdown or build-up tests run for a period of time insufficient to reach the usual straight-line portion of a well test. The analytical solution is presented to the problem of flow of slightly compressible fluid in a limited, composite reservoir with radial symmetry which is produced by a well at the centre. The system is composed of two zones of different permeability in concentric series. The solution to this problem is useful in the fundamental study of the behavior of reservoirs having low permeability ""rim"" and in the pressure transient behavior of some wells having horizontal fracture or a large fractured area such as would be created by a nuclear explosion.

As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are now taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn't always straightforward.With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity--and get the most value out of their test suites.Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)Domain-driven design's distinction between entities, value objects, and aggregatesRepository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storageEvents, commands, and the message busCommand-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices

This book summarizes the latest developments in the area of human factors test and evaluation methods for automated vehicles. Future vehicles will allow a transition of responsibility from the driver to the automated driving system and vice versa. Drivers will have the opportunity to use a wide variety of different driver assistance systems within the same vehicle. This coexistence of different automation levels creates new challenges in the design of the vehicle's human-machine interface (HMI), which have to be accounted for by human factors experts, both in industrial design and in academia. This book brings together the latest developments, empirical evaluations and guidelines on various topics, such as the design and evaluation of interior as well as exterior HMIs for automated vehicles, and the assessment of the impact of automated vehicles on non-automated road users and driver state assessment (e.g., fatigue, motion sickness, fallback readiness) during automated driving.

As flexible and online learning arbitrated by ICT becomes more ubiquitous, there is a developing need for educators to consider methods of assessment using comparable tools. Computer Based Test (CBT) is an effective solution for mass education assessment. However, a diversity of e-assessment methods and systems have been developed in recent times but in the developing world it is still transitional, so far lack of flexible timing functionality to automatically log-off candidates upon expiration of allotted time, result integrity compromise, stand-alone positioning, lack of flexibility, robustness and scalability as well as human error are major limitations of the existing platforms. To ensure maximum security, various security measures/ techniques are used to authenticate the user and check if the person who is logging into the system is the right person or not; various techniques are used like biometric authentication, fingerprint or face recognition via webcam.

ADC testing is an important activity which plays main role in deciding accuracy of a system. Many applications observe measurement using ADC. Such application entails high accuracy and resolution, thus it is provided by signal's dynamic range. The values of ADC parameters can be improved in future by increasing the number of samples, frequency and overdrive. the test algorithm can be applied to real time ADC experimental analysis. Modified code density algorithm that reduces the effect of errors on the histogram data. This algorithm can achieve the same level of accuracy as that of the conventional code-density algorithm but using a significantly smaller number of samples, which means shorter test time and lower test cost. The new method is very efficient and can be used to enable testing of high-resolution ADCs with better coverage and reduce the time and cost of testing medium-resolution ADCs. Sophisticated test instruments required for testing high resolution and high speed ADCs are expensive and bigger in size. Therefore the test methodology followed for new methods of testing is to simulate ADC transfer function with software using sine wave as stimuli inputs.

Charlie promised to be a ""Big Shot,"" as the press dubbed the nation's twenty-fifth nuclear weapons test. With a projected explosive yield equivalent to thirty-three kilotons of TNT, Charlie would be the largest test conducted to date at the Nevada Proving Ground, formerly-and again to be-the Nevada Test Site. Charlie also was big in the sense that for the first time a nuclear weapons test would be held as an ""open"" shot that allowed a significant degree of public access. For the first time, as well, ground and airborne troops would conduct military maneuvers on a simulated nuclear battlefield following the shot. By 9:00 a.m. on April 22, 1952, at H-hour minus thirty minutes, * all was ready and in place for Charlie. Hundreds of observers, dignitaries, and reporters, previously banned from the site, had gathered on a small hill newly christened ""News Nob,"" about nine miles south of ground zero, to await the blast

We have proposed a flexible cuckoo search algorithm to address the problem. The existing cuckoo search algorithm doesn't possess any mechanism to control the stepsize during iterations, which may direct the algorithm to attain global minima or maxima. Here, we have attempted to incorporate a stepsize which is directly proportional to the fitness value of the cuckoo search at present iteration.Within our proposed work we will simulate a flexible cuckoo search algorithm to sort various issues. We will implement the approach in MATLAB [57] [60] and also examine the impact by applying the adaptive cuckoo search using execution time, fitness function, cost and decide the best algorithm for regression tests using adaptive cuckoo search.

What artificial intelligence can tell us about the mind and intelligent behavior.What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation illuminate thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to ""good old fashioned artificial intelligence,"" which is based not on heaps of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns--as we do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test for intelligence--the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. ""If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the difference between making it and faking it,"" he observes. He identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.

Becoming an automated software testing expert first requires knowledge and understanding of an organizations development methodology, tools, schedules, and resources. Within this context, an overall strategy for implementing automated testing can unfold. Development of automated tests needs to be coordinated alongside other test activity and become part of the overall testing strategy. To successfully build and maintain a suite of automated tests requires the adoption of a process similar to application software development. In the world of automated tests, a framework describes those reusable components which form the basis of an automated testing program. An automated testing expert will assess the requirements of an organization, navigate the challenges posed by people and technology, and recommend, plan, implement, and maintain a process that maximizes the participation of all testers in creating automated scripts and analyzing run results. Expert automators should have broad knowledge of technical environments, hands-on experience with a variety of automated testing tools, and a technical background to ensure customization can be achieved.

With rising global warming there has been more focus on using renewable energy to cut green house gasses emitted from burning fossil fuels. Due to the distributed nature of the renewable energy it is not possible to accommodate large quantities of renewable generators in out conventional electricity grid which supports only unidirectional flow of electricity. This forces us to redevelop the electricity grid into something called Smart Grids. Due to the distributed nature the smart grid field components are also distributed and communication is one of the major components in the smart grids. Due to lack of well accepted standards in this relatively new industry manufacturers use a proprietary communication protocol or form an alliance to create a standard. This would lead to compatibility issues when a heterogeneous mixture of components have to be installed in an ecosystem. With no inexpensive test tool which supports multiple protocols to test the compatibility it would be difficult to ensure inter-operability between these devices. In this book we propose a prototype for a communication protocol test bench which can be used to partially automate testing these components.

In this book, the researcher examined the effect of some school related variables such as school size, type, and location to the Mathematics performance of high school students. The researcher being a teacher for ten years in a public secondary school is puzzled about the cause of low performance of students in Mathematics. She experiences public schools problem on poor Mathematics achievement and proficiency consistently. Though leaps and efforts are done to drastically create innovations and progress to the Mathematics Education in the Philippines still low scores is a dilemma. Thinking about this, and considering the scores of some schools that attained Mastery Level in achievement tests like National Achievement Test (NAT) had make the researcher theorized that there might be ""some special ingredient"" in these schools that made them performed better than other schools. She claimed that if other schools will align the local school policies and practices of these schools hence probable positive changes in the Mathematics performance in the country can be guaranteed.

Another day without Test-Driven Development means more time wasted chasing bugs and watching your code deteriorate. You thought TDD was for someone else, but it's not! It's for you, the embedded C programmer. TDD helps you prevent defects and build software with a long useful life. This is the first book to teach the hows and whys of TDD for C programmers.TDD is a modern programming practice C developers need to know. It's a different way to program---unit tests are written in a tight feedback loop with the production code, assuring your code does what you think. You get valuable feedback every few minutes. You find mistakes before they become bugs. You get early warning of design problems. You get immediate notification of side effect defects. You get to spend more time adding valuable features to your product.James is one of the few experts in applying TDD to embedded C. With his 1.5 decades of training, coaching, and practicing TDD in C, C++, Java, and C# he will lead you from being a novice in TDD to using the techniques that few have mastered.This book is full of code written for embedded C programmers. You don't just see the end product, you see code and tests evolve. James leads you through the thought process and decisions made each step of the way. You'll learn techniques for test-driving code right nextto the hardware, and you'll learn design principles and how to apply them to C to keep your code clean and flexible.To run the examples in this book, you will need a C/C++ development environment on your machine, and the GNU GCC tool chain or Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ (some project conversion may be needed).

In test driven development, you first write an executable test ofwhat your application code must do. Only then do you write thecode itself and, with the test spurring you on, you improve yourdesign. In acceptance test driven development (ATDD), you usethe same technique to implement product features, benefiting fromiterative development, rapid feedback cycles, and better-definedrequirements. TDD and its supporting tools and techniques leadto better software faster. Test Driven brings under one cover practical TDD techniquesdistilled from several years of community experience. With examplesin Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both the techniquesand the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully chosen examplesto illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in the abstractbut concretely in the context of the technologies you face at work.It is accessible to TDD beginners, and it offers effective and less wellknown techniques to older TDD hands.  Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book. What's InsideLearn hands-on to test drive Java codeHow to avoid common TDD adoption pitfallsAcceptance test driven development and the Fit frameworkHow to test Java EE components-Servlets, JSPs, and SpringControllersTough issues like multithreaded programs and data access code

This book discusses the new roles that the VLSI (very-large-scale integration of semiconductor circuits) is taking for the safe, secure, and dependable design and operation of electronic systems.The book consists of three parts. Part I, as a general introduction to this vital topic, describes how electronic systems are designed and tested with particular emphasis on dependability engineering, where the simultaneous assessment of the detrimental outcome of failures and cost of their containment is made. This section also describes the related research project ""Dependable VLSI Systems,"" in which the editor and authors of the book were involved for 8 years. Part II addresses various threats to the dependability of VLSIs as key systems components, including time-dependent degradations, variations in device characteristics, ionizing radiation, electromagnetic interference, design errors, and tampering, with discussion of technologies to counter those threats. Part III elaborates on the design and test technologies for dependability in such applications as control of robots and vehicles, data processing, and storage in a cloud environment and heterogeneous wireless telecommunications.  This book is intended to be used as a reference for engineers who work on the design and testing of VLSI systems with particular attention to dependability. It can be used as a textbook in graduate courses as well. Readers interested in dependable systems from social and industrial-economic perspectives will also benefit from the discussions in this book.

Rely on this robust and thorough guide to build and maintain successful test automation. As the software industry shifts from traditional waterfall paradigms into more agile ones, test automation becomes a highly important tool that allows your development teams to deliver software at an ever-increasing pace without compromising quality.Even though it may seem trivial to automate the repetitive tester's work, using test automation efficiently and properly is not trivial. Many test automation endeavors end up in the ""graveyard"" of software projects. There are many things that affect the value of test automation, and also its costs. This book aims to cover all of these aspects in great detail so you can make decisions to create the best test automation solution that will not only help your test automation project to succeed, but also allow the entire software project to thrive.One of the most important details that affects the success of the test automation is how easy it is to maintain the automated tests. Complete Guide to Test Automation provides a detailed hands-on guide for writing highly maintainable test code.What You'll LearnKnow the real value to be expected from test automationDiscover the key traits that will make your test automation project succeedBe aware of the different considerations to take into account when planning automated tests vs. manual testsDetermine who should implement the tests and the implications of this decisionArchitect the test project and fit it to the architecture of the tested applicationDesign and implement highly reliable automated testsBegin gaining value from test automation earlierIntegrate test automation into the business processes of the development teamLeverage test automation to improve your organization's performance and quality, even without formal authorityUnderstand how different types of automated tests will fit into your testing strategy, including unit testing, load and performance testing, visual testing, and moreWho This Book Is ForThose involved with software development such as test automation leads, QA managers, test automation developers, and development managers.
