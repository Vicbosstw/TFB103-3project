A stunning new edition of the best-selling photographic guide to the moths of the British Isles--now covering all species on the British list. British Moths is the most comprehensive collection of photographs of British moths ever published. It covers both macro and micro species, and the images are all of living insects, taken in natural conditions. Concise text descriptions cover wingspan, status and distribution, flight period, habitat and larval foodplants, while thumbnail maps provide a quick overview of geographical distributions. This third edition has been significantly expanded so that it includes all species on the British list, approximately 2,500 in total, representing a magnificent achievement by the author, Chris Manley. It also includes updates to the text, improvements to the photographic selection, and extra identification hints. For the leaf-mining micros, photographs are included to demonstrate the all-important feeding signs that can often be a more reliable identification method than seeing the adult. This revised and now comprehensive edition is an essential part of the library of any moth- or butterfly enthusiast.
