Part 2 then focuses on different strategies for selecting web content to be preserved and on the media types that different web archives host. It provides an overview of efforts to address the preservation of web content as well as smaller-scale but high-quality collections of social media or audiovisual content. Next, Part 3 presents examples of initiatives to improve access to archived web information and provides an overview of access mechanisms for web archives designed to be used by humans or automatically accessed by machines. Part 4 presents research use cases for web archives. It also discusses how to engage more researchers in exploiting web archives and provides inspiring research studies performed using the exploration of web archives. Subsequently, Part 5 demonstrates that web archives should become crucial infrastructures for modern connected societies. It makes the case for developing web archives as research infrastructures and presents several inspiring examples of added-value services built on web archives. Lastly, Part 6 reflects on the evolution of the web and the sustainability of web archiving activities. It debates the requirements and challenges for web archives if they are to assume the responsibility of being societal infrastructures that enable the preservation of memory. This book targets academics and advanced professionals in a broad range of research areas such as digital humanities, social sciences, history, media studies and information or computer science. It also aims to fill the need for a scholarly overview to support lecturers who would like to introduce web archiving into their courses by offering an initial reference for students.

This project deals with the problem of administrative overload in managing students, faculty; support personnel, and course data in the University, taking a case study of the University of Uyo, AKS, Nigeria. It proposes a Secure Student Information System (SSIS). This is expected to be a secure web-based data management system as a solution. Having this goal in mind, object-oriented design, client-server architectures, server-side application development tools, and database technologies are explored. Security measures are designed where necessary on the system to prevent unauthorized access and the best configuration of these tools is selected. These application development tools will be mainly open source software - where the user can have access to and modify the source code. As a result of the study, PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and Apache server pages are found as the optimal servers side programming tools for the application. A working prototype of the system is provided based on MySQL DBMS, Apache web server, and PHP server pages.

The semantic web is similar to the normal web with the structured format and hence the machine learning techniques can easily process the data. Standard format to represent the semantic web data is Resource Description Framework (RDF). In this, the query is structured as SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) to process the data. Various methods have been applied in the semantic web to increase the efficiency and to reduce the computation time.

Web Semantics strengthen the description of web resources to exploit them better and make them more meaningful for both humans and machines, thereby contributing to the development of a knowledgeintensive data web. The world is experiencing the movement of concept from data to knowledge and the movement of web from document model to data model. The underlying idea is making the data machine understandable and processable. In the light of these trends, conciliation of Semantic and the Web is of paramount importance for further progress in the area. Web Semantics: Cutting Edge and Future Directions in Healthcare describes the three major components of the study of Semantic Web, namely Representation, Reasoning, and Security with a special focus on the healthcare domain. This book summarizes the trends and current research advances in web semantics, emphasizing the existing tools and techniques, methodologies, and research solutions. It provides easily comprehensible information on Web Semantics including semantics for data and semantics for services.

This book focuses on finding a way to sustain or enhance the learners' motivation during the learning process within a Web-Based Intelligent Tutoring System (WITS) environment. Studies showed that one of the biggest challenges in asynchronous e-learning environments (such as WITS) is how to keep learners motivated for the entire learning process. Thus, the main question was how best the system should behave in order to sustain or enhance the learners' motivation in such environments. This book suggested that the WITS may use motivational tactics rules to sustain/enhance the learners' motivation during the learning process. The first phase of this study uses an interview approach to extract the motivational tactics rules. The result of the interviews was extracting 64 motivational tactics rules in the form of event-condition-action. Those rules were validated in the second phase of this study using a questionnaire involving 120 participants. After extracting and validating the motivational tactics rules the third phase of this study was conducted in the form of quasi-experimental, using quantitative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted motivational tactics rules

Experience the raw, unannotated version of the original course, Design In Object Technology, created by Dr. Alistair Cockburn. In the 1990s, Dr. Cockburn was one of the leading methodologists in the new area of object-oriented design. Hired by the IBM Consulting Group to create their methodology for object-technology projects, he taught the entire design team on a live project all they would need to know to run the project they were embarking on. This book is that course. Offering a rare glimpse into a moment in time where the standards and practices of object technology were being chartered by the leaders of the day, this book gives an unfiltered look into the approach and techniques used to educate practitioners. Now, in 2021, that course has historical significance. It was at the time a tour-de-force of complete project education, from project management tips to requirements gathering to software design. It set the stage for modern ""agile"" development techniques. Old-timers will enjoy seeing the presentation of these core topics. Newcomers can learn subtleties of techniques they may only have heard of. Everyone will enjoy the depth and liveliness of what might otherwise be a boring Powerpoint deck.

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are invaluable resources for Industry 4.0 and allied areas and are considered as the future of computing. A subfield called neural networks, to recognize and understand patterns in data, helps a machine carry out tasks in a manner similar to humans. The intelligent models developed using ML and DL are effectively designed and are fully investigated - bringing in practical applications in many fields such as health care, agriculture and security. These algorithms can only be successfully applied in the context of data computing and analysis. Today, ML and DL have created conditions for potential developments in detection and prediction. Apart from these domains, ML and DL are found useful in analysing the social behaviour of humans. With the advancements in the amount and type of data available for use, it became necessary to build a means to process the data and that is where deep neural networks prove their importance. These networks are capable of handling a large amount of data in such fields as finance and images. This book also exploits key applications in Industry 4.0 including: - Fundamental models, issues and challenges in ML and DL.- Comprehensive analyses and probabilistic approaches for ML and DL.- Various applications in healthcare predictions such as mental health, cancer, thyroid disease, lifestyle disease and cardiac arrhythmia.- Industry 4.0 applications such as facial recognition, feather classification, water stress prediction, deforestation control, tourism and social networking. - Security aspects of Industry 4.0 applications suggest remedial actions against possible attacks and prediction of associated risks. - Information is presented in an accessible way for students, researchers and scientists, business innovators and entrepreneurs, sustainable assessment and management professionals.This book equips readers with a knowledge of data analytics, ML and DL techniques for applications defined under the umbrella of Industry 4.0.

The first book to be published on the work of their partnership (in 2001), Design Noir is the essential primary source for understanding the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings for Dunne & Raby's work. Consisting of three elements - a 'manifesto' on the possibilities of designing with and for the 'secret life' of electronic objects; notes for an embryonic network of critical designers and, most famously, the presentation of the Placebo Project - a prototype for a critical design poetics enacted around electronic furniture-objects - Design Noir offers an in-depth exploration of one of the most seminal design projects of the last two decades, one that arguably initiated speculating through design in its contemporary forms. By detailing the logic and character of the objects that were constructed; the involvement of users with these objects over-time, and in the creation of a new kinds of spatially and temporally distributed moments of critique and engagement with things, Design Noir presents the case-study of the Placebo projectas a far more complex and subtler project than is often thought. As a bold and in many ways unprecedented experiment in design writing and book designing, Design Noir is itself an instance of the speculative propositional design it expounds.

Optimal Reliability-Based Design of Structures Against Several Natural Hazards,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109918861?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=3,"Alfredo H-S,Ang",Ingram      ,9781032011301.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1301/9781032011301.jpg,"

Interest in the topic of structural reliability and optimal design has been rapidly growing in recent years. Besides, the field of numerical methods and artificial intelligence is experiencing a surge of new methods and the refinement of existing ones to expand opportunities to apply robust formulations to complex engineering problems. Today, more than ever, the field is receiving fresh ideas on how to face the challenges of finding a balance between cost and benefits that may lead towards the optimal design of systems. Recently, the probability density evolution method (PDEM) was proposed by Prof. Jie Li as an alternative way to obtain the stochastic and dynamic solution of the safety level of engineering systems under any kind of hazard. This work deals with the application of this powerful method to derive optimal design recommendations for large engineering systems under natural hazards. The three case studies illustrate to engineers and academic specialists how to strike a cost-effective balance in designing such systems.

Design Research uses scientific methods to evaluate designs and build design theories. This book starts with recognizable questions in Design Research, such as A/B testing, how users learn to operate a device and why computer-generated faces are eerie. Using a broad range of examples, efficient research designs are presented together with statistical models and many visualizations. With the tidy R approach, producing publication-ready statistical reports is straight-forward and even non-programmers can learn this in just one day. Hundreds of illustrations, tables, simulations and models are presented with full R code and data included. Using Bayesian linear models, multi-level models and generalized linear models, an extensive statistical framework is introduced, covering a huge variety of research situations and yet, building on only a handful of basic concepts. Unique solutions to recurring problems are presented, such as psychometric multi-level models, beta regression for rating scales and ExGaussian regression for response times. A ""think-first"" approach is promoted for model building, as much as the quantitative interpretation of results, stimulating readers to think about data generating processes, as well as rational decision making. New Statistics for Design Researchers: A Bayesian Workflow in Tidy R targets scientists, industrial researchers and students in a range of disciplines, such as Human Factors, Applied Psychology, Communication Science, Industrial Design, Computer Science and Social Robotics. Statistical concepts are introduced in a problem-oriented way and with minimal formalism. Included primers on R and Bayesian statistics provide entry point for all backgrounds. A dedicated chapter on model criticism and comparison is a valuable addition for the seasoned scientist.

An observational study is an empiric investigation of effects caused by treatments when randomized experimentation is unethical or infeasible. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies.  Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum's Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher's striking advice for observational studies, ""make your theories elaborate.""  The second edition of his book, Observational Studies, was published by Springer in 2002.

Reconfigurable systems have pervaded nearly all fields of computation and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Reconfigurable System Design and Verification provides a compendium of design and verification techniques for reconfigurable systems, allowing you to quickly search for a technique and determine if it is appropriate to the task at hand. It bridges the gap between the need for reconfigurable computing education and the burgeoning development of numerous different techniques in the design and verification of reconfigurable systems in various application domains. The text explains topics in such a way that they can be immediately grasped and put into practice. It starts with an overview of reconfigurable computing architectures and platforms and demonstrates how to develop reconfigurable systems. This sets up the discussion of the hardware, software, and system techniques that form the core of the text. The authors classify design and verification techniques into primary and secondary categories, allowing the appropriate ones to be easily located and compared. The techniques discussed range from system modeling and system-level design to co-simulation and formal verification. Case studies illustrating real-world applications, detailed explanations of complex algorithms, and self-explaining illustrations add depth to the presentation. Comprehensively covering all techniques related to the hardware-software design and verification of reconfigurable systems, this book provides a single source for information that otherwise would have been dispersed among the literature, making it very difficult to search, compare, and select the technique most suitable. The authors do it all for you, making it easy to find the techniques that fit your system requirements, without having to surf the net or digital libraries to find the candidate techniques and compare them yourself.

The last three decades have marked an era of technological upheaval as frenetic and groundbreaking as there ever has been. From early desktop computers and mobile phones to virtual reality: the web is now virtually inseparable from all facets of human interaction and daily life. But it wasn't always funny cat videos and sleek interfaces.This collection is a visual journey through time, gathering the very earliest examples of what we today take for granted: the first website to use surround sound, the first drag-and-drop navigation, the first page-turn effect, the first website to use seamless video integration, the first viral site, the first parallax website, the first 'upload-your-face' website, the first site to incorporate a mobile phone, the first ever YouTube-like ""website"", and many more.It gathers more than 200 websites, and each comes with quotes and insights from the creators themselves--an invaluable peek into the minds of pioneers who paved the pixelized way for many to follow, including Jonathan Gay (Flash), Gabo Mendoza (Gabocorp), Yugo Nakamura (Yugop), Peter Van Den Wyngaert (NRG.BE), Joshua Davis (Praystation), and Eric Jordan (2Advanced).This comprehensive visual history gathers 21 chapters that detail, for every year since 1998, the best websites and examples of hardware used at the time, and explore how user experience, usability, and technological milestones have influenced the development of the internet we use today. Year-by-year factsheets and smart Google insights orient the reader through major developments across such categories as world news headlines, highest grossing films, new soft and hardware, greatest website traffic, and many more.For many, this collection will offer a virtual trip down nostalgia lane--but all generations will find a sweeping reference work as well as a celebration of how the earliest creative minds came to define the web, and eventually the world, as we know it.

Sewage is the wastewater generated by the community of human beings. Around 70 % of freshwater consumption is converting into wastewater. Wastewater is contaminated by domestic, industrial, and commercial use that changes its parameters continuously such as COD, BOD, pH, harness, TSS, etc. Water scarcity is a big challenge to fulfill the per capita demand of the city. Hence there is an urgent need to treat the wastewater and utilize it effectively so that the demand for water can be full fill. It is observed that 99% of water is characterized by the rate of flow of its biological, chemical, and physical factors (BOD, COD, pH, TDS, TSS). Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a promising process combination of activated sludge treatment and membrane filtration for biomass reduction retention. MBR is the emerging treatment technology that was implemented to treat sewage wastewater and reuse the water for various purposes like gardening, toilet flushing, farming, etc. The design of the sewage treatment plant was carried out for Dr. Vithalrao Vikhe Patil College of Engineering Ahmednagar, (M.S), India. MBR technology was implemented successfully for Imagica water park Khopoli, Maharashtra.

Design of Contemporary Inland Waterway Vessels,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108627231?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=4,"Dejan,Radojčic",Springer    ,9783030773243.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3243/9783030773243.jpg,"

Inland Waterway (IW), or river vessels are in every respect different from the seagoing ships. The professional literature is mostly focused on conventional seagoing fleets, leaving a gap in the documentation of design practices for IW vessels. The principal attribute that differentiates river vessels from the seagoing ships is the low, or shallow, draught due to water depth restrictions.This book addresses key aspects for the design of contemporary, shallow draught IW vessels for the transport of dry cargo (containers and bulk cargo). Most of the logic that is presented is applicable to the design of river vessels for any river, but the material that is presented is focused on vessels for the River Danube and its tributaries. The term 'contemporary river vessel' assumes that the present-day technology and current Danube river infrastructure are taken into consideration in its design. It is believed that the technologies and concepts that are proposed here are applicable for all new vessel designs for the next 10 to 15 years. Other innovative technologies should be considered for designs beyond that horizon. Moreover, nowadays contemporary IW vessel must be in harmony with the Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST) policies and hence special attention is paid to both ecology and efficiency. Note however that shipowners and ship operators usually tend to choose the conventional cost-effective transport technologies. Given that potential divergence of interests, the concepts and technologies treated here may be regarded as innovative.

The present work provides a platform for leading Data designers whose vision and creativity help us to anticipate major changes occurring in the Data Design field, and pre-empt the future. Each of them strives to provide new answers to the question, ""What challenges await Data Design?"" To avoid falling into too narrow a mind-set, each works hard to elucidate the breadth of Data Design today and to demonstrate its widespread application across a variety of business sectors. With end users in mind, designer-contributors bring to light the myriad of purposes for which the field was originally intended, forging the bond even further between Data Design and the aims and intentions of those who contribute to it. The first seven parts of the book outline the scope of Data Design, and presents a line-up of ""viewpoints"" that highlight this discipline's main topics, and offers an in-depth look into practices boasting both foresight and imagination. The eighth and final part features a series of interviews with Data designers and artists whose methods embody originality and marked singularity. As a result, a number of enlightening concepts and bright ideas unfold within the confines of this book to help dispel the thick fog around this new and still relatively unknown discipline. A plethora of equally eye-opening and edifying new terms, words, and key expressions also unfurl. Informing, influencing, and inspiring are just a few of the buzz words belonging to an initiative that is, first and foremost, a creative one, not to mention the possibility to discern the ever-changing and naturally complex nature of today's datasphere. Providing an invaluable and cutting-edge resource for design researchers, this work is also intended for students, professionals and practitioners involved in Data Design, Interaction Design, Digital & Media Design, Data & Information Visualization, Computer Science and Engineering.

Agriculture is an important sector of the economy. In order to produce food takes a lot of processes using dedicated machines. One such machine is the plough. Its construction has changed over the centuries. Many research centers and companies conduct continuing studies to improve the construction of ploughs. It is important to reduce the cost of fuel during plowing .One of the important parts of the plow is a mould board. Its shape and tribological properties have a great influence on the work of the plough. In this paper the influence of pressure directed at the working surfaces of the plough body to the stresses inside the structure was analyzed. The analysis was performed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in Auto Desk Inventor Professional 2015. FEA analysis allows pre-testing of the properties of the part before manufacturing. Creating model and adding forces and pressures to it allows for huge savings for companies. It is possible to find weaknesses in designed products before they cause problems

Old age is currently the greatest risk factor for developing dementia. Since older people make up a larger portion of the population than ever before, the resulting increase in the incidence of dementia presents a major challenge for society. Dementia is complex and multifaceted and impacts not only the person with the diagnosis but also those caring for them and society as a whole.  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design and development are pivotal in enabling people with dementia to live well and be supported in the communities around them. HCI is increasingly addressing the need for inclusivity and accessibility in the design and development of new technologies, interfaces, systems, services, and tools. Using interdisciplinary approaches HCI engages with the complexities and 'messiness' of real-world design spaces to provide novel perspectives and new ways of addressing the challenge of dementia and multi-stakeholder needs. HCI and Design in the Context of Dementia brings together the work of international experts, designers and researchers working across disciplines. It provides methodologies, methods and frameworks, approaches to participatory engagement and case studies showing how technology can impact the lives of people living with dementia and those around them. It includes examples of how to conduct dementia research and design in-context in the field of HCI, ethically and effectively and how these issues transcend the design space of dementia to inform HCI design and technology development more broadly. The book is valuable for and aimed at designers, researchers, scholars and caregivers that work with vulnerable groups like people with dementia, and those directly impacted.

Starting from the core of a copper-wound transformer, we design a winding transformer in aluminum and compare the results obtained in Matlab's Simulink simulation.Companies such as Rymel and ABB have implemented the construction of large power transformers with aluminum sheets, so it is important to propose a discussion about the subject for future research. This paper presents the design of an aluminum-wound transformer, showing the advantages and disadvantages of this material. The aluminum-wound transformer is 40% lighter and 30% larger compared to the copper-wound transformer. However, the heat dissipation presented by the aluminum winding is superior to that of a copper winding due to the cross section of the aluminum conductor and the coefficient of thermal conductivity.

In Wireless Communication, an equalizer is the inversion of bending caused by a signal transmitted through a channel. Equalizers are utilized to render the recurrence reaction-for example of a phone line level from start to finish. At the point when a channel has been evened out the recurrence space qualities of the signal at the information are loyally imitated at the yield. Phones, DSL lines and TV links use equalizers to get ready information signals for transmission. Equalizers are basic to the effective activity of electronic frameworks, for example, simple communicate TV. In this application the genuine waveform of the transmitted flag must be protected, not simply its recurrence content. Evening out channels must counterbalance any gathering postponement and stage delay between various recurrence parts

The application of modern machineries in agricultural production has been one of the outstanding developments in the world of agriculture. Mechanization is particularly advantageous in minimizing labour demand, enhance timeliness, increases production and productivity etc. The reduction in the yield due to weed alone is estimated about 30-60 per cent and one third of the cost of cultivation is being spent for weeding alone. Weeding problems are facing farmers everywhere. Development of self propelled walking type weeder may contribute to fulfill the mechanization gap to do the weeding operation at the faster rate. In this book an attempt has been made to provide information on methodology followed for design principles, development and optimization of operational parameters and performance evaluation of self propelled weeder.

There are many systems which uses RAM as it's primary memory for example spacecraft, our home computer etc. Energy efficient RAM is even more important in outer space exploration as the power source is very limited and the environmental condition is very extreme. Energy efficiency is not only based on the architecture of the system but also on the environmental condition. Therefore energy efficient RAM will increase the performance of the system even in the extreme condition. In this work, we are going to design a RAM that will energy efficient even in extreme condition. Four different FPGA are taken under consideration and our RAM design is implemented on these four ICs and we find the most energy efficient architecture among these four architectures taken into consideration. There is reduction in power consumption when we migrate our RAM design from Kintex-7 architecture to Artix-7 Architecture.The result are obtained by using Xillinx Vivado 19.1 simulator with verilog hardware description language.

Emerging non-volatile universal memory technology is vital for providing the huge storage capabilities required by the nano-computing facilities. The recently found memristor, ""the missing fourth circuit element"", is a potential candidate for the next-generation memory and has received extra attention in the last few years. In this book, a literature review of different physical realizations of the memristor is discussed. Following that, a comparison between two of the most promising physical realizations is conducted. Besides, memristor-based memory Read/Write circuit design considerations are demonstrated. Current literatures show destructive reading issue when using the memristor as a memory element. This work is targeting at solving this issue by providing three novel Read/Write circuit designs to facilitate the reading and writing operation of the memristor device. The proposed circuits exhibit lower power consumption and less delay when compared to recently published Read/Write circuits. In addition, two of the proposed circuits have the advantage of non-destructive successive reading cycles capability as well as occupying small layout area.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be defined as systems in which physical objects are represented in the digital world and integrated with computation, storage, and communication capabilities and are connected to each other in a network. The goal in the use of the CPS is integrating the dynamics of the physical processes with those of the software and networking, providing abstractions and modelling, design, and analysis techniques for the integrated whole. The notion of CPS is linked to concepts of robotics and sensor networks with intelligent systems proper of computational intelligence leading the pathway. Recent advances in science and engineering improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent systems, increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems. The potential of cyber-physical systems will spread to several directions, including but not limited to intervention, precision manufacturing, operations in dangerous or inaccessible environments, coordination, efficiency, Maintenance 4.0, and augmentation of human capabilities. Design, Applications, and Maintenance of Cyber-Physical Systems gives insights about CPS as tools for integrating the dynamics of the physical processes with those of software and networking, providing abstractions and modelling, design, and analysis techniques for their smart manufacturing interoperation. The book will have an impact upon the research on robotics, mechatronics, integrated intelligent multibody systems, Industry 4.0, production systems management and maintenance, decision support systems, and Maintenance 4.0. The chapters discuss not only the technologies involved in CPS but also insights into how they are used in various industries. This book is ideal for engineers, practitioners, researchers, academicians, and students who are interested in a deeper understanding of cyber-physical systems (CPS), their design, application, and maintenance, with a special focus on modern technologies in Industry 4.0 and Maintenance 4.0.

Sustainability is becoming increasingly more important in this modern age. One of the world's largest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) corporations, Unilever, has sustainability at the forefront of its corporate mission (receiving the 'Internationals Charter's 'Committed to the Environment 2010' award for environmental management and performance') and therefore continue to do their utmost to reduce all areas of environmental impact within the business. Astonishingly, 68% of the carbon footprint is caused by consumer use (after Unilever's products have left the shelves) so it is therefore extremely important that Unilever uses tools, methods and new innovations to help consumers have more sustainable behaviour.

Moore's law has driven the scaling of digital electronic devicesdimensions and performances over the last 50 years. As a result, logic components in a System-On-Chip (SoC) have shown dramatic performance improvement. On the other hand, an on-chip interconnects which was considered only as a parasitic load before 1990s became the real performance bottleneck due to its extremely reduced cross section dimension. The ever decreasing interconnects cross section dimensions give rise to increase in resistance. Putting all these together, degradation of the RC time constant of on-chip metal wires becomes more serious. As a result, the continuous performance degradation of on-chip Cu/low k interconnects is one of the greatest challenges to keep Moore's law alive while the scaling of transistors dimension has provided relentless delay improvement.

A bituminous paving mixture is a combination of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and bitumen mixed with appropriate proportion to result strong and durable mix to have different traffic load. In bituminous paving mixture, normally cement and stone dust are utilized as filler material. For comparison, cement used to prepare control mix. Marshall Stability test is employed to find stability, flow value, % air voids, (VMA) voids in mineral aggregate, voids filled with bitumen (VFB) properties for a bituminous paving mixture. The work is carried out by using specifications as per MORTH (Ministry of road transports & highways, specifications for road & bridge works, 5th revision). By replacing the cement with fly ash at the levels 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% the results are compared. The variation of properties, optimum bitumen and optimum fly ash contents are determined. It is observed that the control mixes with fly ash as filler not much differ in properties when compared with mix and satisfy desired criteria specified by a much higher margin. It has been recommended to use of fly ash, not only reducing the cost of execution, also solve utilization of fly ash and its disposal problems.

The updated and improved second edition of Direct Gear Design details a nonstandard gear design approach that makes it possible to significantly improve gear drive performance. Providing engineers with gear design solutions beyond standard limits, this book delivers engineers with practical and innovative solutions to optimize gearing technologies.The majority of modern gears are over-standardized, not allowing gear design engineers to see possible gear design solutions outside of standard limits. The book explores opportunities to improve and optimize gears beyond these limitations. The method of Direct Gear Design has been proven to maximise gear drive performance, increase transmission load capacity and efficiency, and reduce size and weight. Discussing the use of gears made from powder metal and plastic, the book surveys gear manufacture and makes use of extensive references to encourage further exploration of gear design innovation. Additionally, the book provides an overview of manufacturing technologies and traditional gear design, as well as covering topics such as asymmetric gears, tolerance selection and measurement methods of custom gears.Written accessibly, with a focus on practical examples, this fully updated edition will serve as a guidebook for all professionals exploring high-performance gearing system technologies.

This book is the companion volume to Design Examples for High Strength Steel Reinforced Concrete Columns - A Eurocode 4 Approach.Guidance is much needed on the design of high strength steel reinforced concrete (SRC) columns beyond the remit of Eurocode 4. Given the much narrower range of permitted concrete and steel material strengths in comparison to EC2 and EC3, and the better ductility and buckling resistance of SRC columns compared to steel or reinforced concrete, there is a clear need for design beyond the guidelines. This book looks at the design of SRC columns using high strength concrete, high strength structural steel and high strength reinforcing steel materials - columns with concrete cylinder strength up to 90 N/mm2, yield strength of structural steel up to 690 N/mm2 and yield strength of reinforcing steel up to 600 N/mm2 respectively. The companion volume provides detailed worked examples on use of these high strength materials.This book is written primarily for structural engineers and designers who are familiar with basic EC4 design, and should also be useful to civil engineering undergraduate and graduate students who are studying composite steel concrete design and construction. Equations for design resistances are presented clearly so that they can be easily programmed into design spreadsheets for ease of use.

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) allow many statistical analyses to be extended to important statistical distributions other than the Normal distribution. While numerous books exist on how to analyse data using a GLM, little information is available on how to collect the data that are to be analysed in this way.This is the first book focusing specifically on the design of experiments for GLMs. Much of the research literature on this topic is at a high mathematical level, and without any information on computation. This book explains the motivation behind various techniques, reduces the difficulty of the mathematics, or moves it to one side if it cannot be avoided, and gives examples of how to write and run computer programs using R. Features  The generalisation of the linear model to GLMs  Background mathematics, and the use of constrained optimisation in R  Coverage of the theory behind the optimality of a design  Individual chapters on designs for data that have Binomial or Poisson distributions  Bayesian experimental design  An online resource contains R programs used in the book This book is aimed at readers who have done elementary differentiation and understand minimal matrix algebra, and have familiarity with R. It equips professional statisticians to read the research literature. Nonstatisticians will be able to design their own experiments by following the examples and using the programs provided.

From the development of polymers that make cars lighter to fuels that make them run cleaner, the chemist's role in the automotive industry has evolved to be one that is more outside the laboratory than in it. Drawing on the author's 20 years of experience in vehicle design and laboratory experience, The Role of the Chemist in Automotive Design elucidates how the skills of chemists are put to use in the automotive industry and their effect on all phases of design. A glance through the table of contents provides an overview of the issues commonly encountered by chemists in the automotive industry. The author discusses fuels cells, lithium ion batteries, carbon nanotubes, and nickel metal hydride technology, all of which require the technical knowledge of a chemist but cross the lines of various disciplines. He also covers future technology including items such as battery technology, fuel cell membranes, and environmentally friendly plastics such as nylons that use castor oil as a primary component. The book examines environmental concerns such as CARB legislation and how the industry plans to deal with the new legislation with strategies such as Ozone Reduction Catalyst.The increasing technological, environmental, and economic issues facing the auto industry underscores the need for a basic reference that covers technologies that can be used to make vehicle more fuel efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost efficient. Exploring the expanding role chemists will play in future automotive design and technology, this book delineates the areas and technologies that require the technical knowledge of a chemist but that cross the lines of many disciplines.

We all see what the internet does and increasingly don't like it, but do we know how and more importantly who makes it work that way? That's where the real power lays... The internet was supposed to be a thing of revolutions. As that dream curdles, there is no shortage of villains to blame--from tech giants to Russian bot farms. But what if the problem is not an issue of bad actors ruining a good thing? What if the hazards of the internet are built into the system itself? That's what journalist James Ball argues as he takes us to the root of the problem, from the very establishment of the internet's earliest protocols to the cables that wire it together. He shows us how the seemingly abstract and pervasive phenomenon is built on a very real set of materials and rules that are owned, financed, designed and regulated by very real people. In this urgent and necessary book, Ball reveals that the internet is not a neutral force but a massive infrastructure that reflects the society that created it. And making it work for--and not against--us must be an endeavor of the people as well.

Implement application programming interface (API) usability, security, availability, reliability, and scalability to extend your company's market and potentially generate revenue. Businesses know they need to extend their markets into the digital world, and expose internal data to the Internet. This book shows how stakeholders within an organization can make it a successful journey.  Stakeholder needs are not identical and departments experience difficulties discussing requirements with each other due to their different fundamental understanding of the process. The goal of this book is to introduce a common language for all business groups--developers, security experts, architects, product managers--around APIs and provide an overview of all aspects that need to be considered when exposing internal data. Most of the content in this book is based on feedback from real-world enterprise customer questions, challenges, and business scenarios. Practical guidance is provided on the business value of APIs, the general requirements to know, and how to undertake an audience-based implementation. You will learn how to protect access to data, as well as API error handling, documentation, management, integration, and more. What You'll Learn Know the types of APIs and their business and technical requirementsThe main benefits of APIs, including business value, loose coupling, and frequent updatesProtect access to APIs through role-based access, attribute-based access, and rate limitingDistinguish between OAuth and OpenID Connect, and know how they both workManage API error handling, including what should and should not be handledUnderstand the distinction between runtime, dynamic data, and static dataLeverage external APIs as part of your own APIs       Who This Book Is For API developers, API security experts, software architects, product owners, and business owners

The Design of Rijndael,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c106318891?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=7,"Joan,Daemen",Springer    ,9783662607718.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7718/9783662607718.jpg,"

Rijndael was the surprise winner of the contest for the new Advanced En- cryption Standard (AES) for the United States. This contest was organized and run by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) be- ginning in January 1997; Rijndael was announced as the winner in October 2000. It was the ""surprise winner"" because many observers (and even some participants) expressed scepticism that the D.S. government would adopt as an encryption standard any algorithm that was not designed by D.S. citizens. Yet NIST ran an open, international, selection process that should serve as model for other standards organizations. For example, NIST held their 1999 AES meeting in Rome, Italy. The five finalist algorithms were designed by teams from all over the world. In the end, the elegance, efficiency, security, and principled design of Rijndael won the day for its two Belgian designers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, over the competing finalist designs from RSA, IBM, Counterpane Systems, and an EnglishjIsraelijDanish team. This book is the story of the design of Rijndael, as told by the designers themselves. It outlines the foundations of Rijndael in relation to the previous ciphers the authors have designed. It explains the mathematics needed to and the operation of Rijndael, and it provides reference C code and underst test vectors for the cipher.

Revision with unchanged content. An often stated problem in the state-of-the-art web search is its lack of user adaptation, as all users are presented with the same search results for a given query string. The effectiveness of a personalization of web search shows high variance in performance depending on the query, the user and the search context. To this end, carefully choosing the right personalization strategy in a context sensitive manner is critical for an improvement of search results. In this book, we first introduce some fundamentals of the general information retrieval process as well as incorporating relevance feedback information. We also present a brief summary of current personalization approaches followed by the presentation of a general framework that dynamically adapts the query-result ranking to the different information needs in order to improve the search experience for the individual user. This book is intended to act as a focal point for researchers and practitioners whose work is related to web information seeking and interaction, and with a precise focus on search personalization.

This book describes the identification of Subgraphs in the Object-Oriented Design using a Closed subgraph mining Algorithm. Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) allows to leverage the best practices and principles, thus reduces a human effort for reinventing new design. Further, understanding a software design is not an easy task, it requires a lot of domain and a deep understanding of OOP principles. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify similar design structures in a group.Further, for large object-oriented systems, it is difficult to understand the functionalities because of their topological and behavioral complexity. It is even more difficult to extend or modify an existing design, which can be error-prone and can even lead to poor quality of software. Developers who work with software systems tend to break large and complex systems into smaller sub-components. Therefore, this research work proposes a partitioning based graph mining approach to discover frequent identical design patterns in an object-oriented design model.

The World Wide Web has now been in use for more than 20 years. From early browsers to today's principal source of information, entertainment and much else, the Web is an integral part of our daily lives, to the extent that some people believe 'if it's not online, it doesn't exist.' While this statement is not entirely true, it is becoming increasingly accurate, and reflects the Web's role as an indispensable treasure trove. It is curious, therefore, that historians and social scientists have thus far made little use of the Web to investigate historical patterns of culture and society, despite making good use of letters, novels, newspapers, radio and television programmes, and other pre-digital artefacts. This volume argues that now is the time to ask what we have learnt from the Web so far. The 12 chapters explore this topic from a number of interdisciplinary angles - through histories of national web spaces and case studies of different government and media domains - as well as an introduction that provides an overview of this exciting new area of research.

How can the Web be made situation-aware? Event processing is a suitable technology for gaining the necessary real-time results. The Web, however, has many users and many application domains. Thus, we developed multi-schema friendly data models allowing the re-use and mix from diverse users and application domains. Furthermore, our methods describe protocols to exchange events on the Web, algorithms to execute the language and to calculate access rights.

"Third Space, Information Sharing, and Participatory Design",https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108501328?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=8,Morgan & Claypool,Ingram      ,9781636391731.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1731/9781636391731.jpg,"

Society faces many challenges in workplaces, everyday life situations, and education contexts. Within information behavior research, there are often calls to bridge inclusiveness and for greater collaboration, with user-centered design approaches and, more specifically, participatory design practices. Collaboration and participation are essential in addressing contemporary societal challenges, designing creative information objects and processes, as well as developing spaces for learning, and information and research interventions. The intention is to improve access to information and the benefits to be gained from that. This also applies to bridging the digital divide and for embracing artificial intelligence. With regard to research and practices within information behavior, it is crucial to consider that all users should be involved. Many information activities (i.e., activities falling under the umbrella terms of information behavior and information practices) manifest through participation, and thus, methods such as participatory design may help unfold both information behavior and practices as well as the creation of information objects, new models, and theories. Information sharing is one of its core activities. For participatory design with its value set of democratic, inclusive, and open participation towards innovative practices in a diversity of contexts, it is essential to understand how information activities such as sharing manifest itself. For information behavior studies it is essential to deepen understanding of how information sharing manifests in order to improve access to information and the use of information. Third Space is a physical, virtual, cognitive, and conceptual space where participants may negotiate, reflect, and form new knowledge and worldviews working toward creative, practical and applicable solutions, finding innovative, appropriate research methods, interpreting findings, proposing new theories, recommending next steps, and even designing solutions such as new information objects or services. Information sharing in participatory design manifests in tandem with many other information interaction activities and especially information and cognitive processing. Although there are practices of individual information sharing and information encountering, information sharing mostly relates to collaborative information behavior practices, creativity, and collective decision-making. Our purpose with this book is to enable students, researchers, and practitioners within a multi-disciplinary research field, including information studies and Human-Computer Interaction approaches, to gain a deeper understanding of how the core activity of information sharing in participatory design, in which Third Space may be a platform for information interaction, is taking place when using methods utilized in participatory design to address contemporary societal challenges. This could also apply for information behavior studies using participatory design as methodology. We elaborate interpretations of core concepts such as participatory design, Third Space, information sharing, and collaborative information behavior, before discussing participatory design methods and processes in more depth. We also touch on information behavior, information practice, and other important concepts. Third Space, information sharing, and information interaction are discussed in some detail. A framework, with Third Space as a core intersecting zone, platform, and adaptive and creative space to study information sharing and other information behavior and interactions are suggested. As a tool to envision information behavior and suggest future practices, participatory design serves as a set of methods and tools in which new interpretations of the design of information behavior studies and eventually new information objects are being initiated involving multiple stakeholders in future information landscapes.

This book is designed using Visual ASP .Net 2010 and MS-SQL Server 2008. The coding language used is VB.NET. The project involves settings for various options such as searching the web pages and extracts the mail ids, web URLs, phone numbers, songs download links and tags such as heading tags. The depth level is given so that not only from the given web pages but the pages linked with this web page are searched and the content is extracted. Multi-threading approach is used so that each page is searched by a separate thread and this assists in faster process. In the proposed system multiple web-pages can be searched in same or different web site with an intelligent search, thus it takes the resource from a webpage with the usage of depths. The intelligent search is performed using an advanced extraction called regular expression and so any kind of information can be extracted. For example, the pattern \d{6} retrieves the Indian Pincodes.

Revision with unchanged content. In this book we define a methodology for the semi-automated aggregation and adaptation of Web services capable of suitably overcoming semantic and behaviour mismatches in view of business process integration within and across organisational boundaries. We tackle the aggregation and adaptation of services described by service contracts, which consist of signature (WSDL), ontology information (OWL), and behaviour specification (YAWL). We first describe an aggregation technique that automatically generates contracts of composite services satisfying (behavioural) client requests from a registry of service contracts. Further on, we present a behaviour-aware adaptation technique that supports the customisation of services to fulfil client requests. The adaptation technique can be used to adapt the behaviour of services to satisfy both functional and behavioural requests. We support the generation of service contracts from real-world service descriptions by introducing a pattern-based compositional translator for the automated generation of YAWL workflows from BPEL business processes. In this way, we pave the way for the formal analysis, aggregation, and adaptation of BPEL processes.

Revision with unchanged content. Everyday, we engage in the use of networked information systems and websites to search for information. Whatever information users search for, it is highly possible that it can be found somewhere in the digital world. But, oftentimes, searching for information is neither effective nor efficient. When a user searches for information, a system often returns a large number of irrelevant results. Thus, the critical issue facing the current digital world is not the lack of information, but ill-structured information and inefficient information retrieval.This study concerned the testing of user performance when searching an ontology-driven information retrieval (ONTOIR) system that shows explicit relationships among resources. The goal was to examine whether or not ontology enhances user performance in terms of recall and search time. The experiment was conducted with 40 participants to evaluate and compare the differences in user performance (recall and search time) between an ontology-driven information retrieval system and a traditional, thesaurus-driven information retrieval system. Better recall and shorter search time were found when conducting relationship-based queries in an ontology-driven information retrieval system as compared to a thesaurus-based system. The book is addressed to knowledge managers, information architects, and other information professionals.

For participatory design with its value set of democratic, inclusive, and open participation towards innovative practices in a diversity of contexts, it is essential to understand how information activities such as sharing manifest itself. For information behavior studies it is essential to deepen understanding of how information sharing manifests in order to improve access to information and the use of information. Third Space is a physical, virtual, cognitive, and conceptual space where participants may negotiate, reflect, and form new knowledge and worldviews working toward creative, practical and applicable solutions, finding innovative, appropriate research methods, interpreting findings, proposing new theories, recommending next steps, and even designing solutions such as new information objects or services. Information sharing in participatory design manifests in tandem with many other information interaction activities and especially information and cognitive processing. Although there are practices of individual information sharing and information encountering, information sharing mostly relates to collaborative information behavior practices, creativity, and collective decision-making. Our purpose with this book is to enable students, researchers, and practitioners within a multi-disciplinary research field, including information studies and Human-Computer Interaction approaches, to gain a deeper understanding of how the core activity of information sharing in participatory design, in which Third Space may be a platform for information interaction, is taking place when using methods utilized in participatory design to address contemporary societal challenges. This could also apply for information behavior studies using participatory design as methodology. We elaborate interpretations of core concepts such as participatory design, Third Space, information sharing, and collaborative information behavior, before discussing participatory design methods and processes in more depth. We also touch on information behavior, information practice, and other important concepts. Third Space, information sharing, and information interaction are discussed in some detail. A framework, with Third Space as a core intersecting zone, platform, and adaptive and creative space to study information sharing and other information behavior and interactions are suggested. As a tool to envision information behavior and suggest future practices, participatory design serves as a set of methods and tools in which new interpretations of the design of information behavior studies and eventually new information objects are being initiated involving multiple stakeholders in future information landscapes.

This comprehensive overview of IoT systems architecture includes in-depth treatment of all key components: edge, communications, cloud, data processing, security, management, and uses. Internet of Things: Concepts and System Design provides a reference and foundation for students and practitioners that they can build upon to design IoT systems and to understand how the specific parts they are working on fit into and interact with the rest of the system. This is especially important since IoT is a multidisciplinary area that requires diverse skills and knowledge including: sensors, embedded systems, real-time systems, control systems, communications, protocols, Internet, cloud computing, large-scale distributed processing and storage systems, AI and ML, (preferably) coupled with domain experience in the area where it is to be applied, such as building or manufacturing automation.  Written in a reader-minded approach that starts by describing the problem (why should I care?), placing it in context (what does this do and where/how does it fit in the great scheme of things?) and then describing salient features of solutions (how does it work?), this book covers the existing body of knowledge and design practices, but also offers the author's insights and articulation of common attributes and salient features of solutions such as IoT information modeling and platform characteristics.

This book's main goals are to bring together in a concise way all the methodologies, standards and recommendations related to Data, Queries, Links, Semantics, Validation and other issues concerning machine-readable data on the Web, to describe them in detail, to provide examples of their use, and to discuss how they contribute to - and how they have been used thus far on - the ""Web of Data"". As the content of the Web becomes increasingly machine readable, increasingly complex tasks can be automated, yielding more and more powerful Web applications that are capable of discovering, cross-referencing, filtering, and organizing data from numerous websites in a matter of seconds.The book is divided into nine chapters, the first of which introduces the topic by discussing the shortcomings of the current Web and illustrating the need for a Web of Data. Next, ""Web of Data"" provides an overview of the fundamental concepts involved, and discusses some current use-cases on the Web where such concepts are already being employed. ""Resource Description Framework (RDF)"" describes the graph-structured data model proposed by the Semantic Web community as a common data model for the Web. The chapter on ""RDF Schema (RDFS) and Semantics"" presents a lightweight ontology language used to define an initial semantics for terms used in RDF graphs. In turn, the chapter ""Web Ontology Language (OWL)"" elaborates on a more expressive ontology language built upon RDFS that offers much more powerful ontological features. In ""SPARQL Query Language"" a language for querying and updating RDF graphs is described, with examples of the features it supports, supplemented by a detailed definition of its semantics. ""Shape Constraints and Expressions (SHACL/ShEx)"" introduces two languages for describing the expected structure of - and expressing constraints on - RDF graphs for the purposes of validation. ""Linked Data"" discusses the principles and best practices proposed by the Linked Data community for publishing interlinked (RDF) data on the Web, and how these techniques have been adopted. The final chapter highlights open problems and rounds out the coverage with a more general discussion on the future of the Web of Data.  The book is intended for students, researchers and advanced practitioners interested in learning more about the Web of Data, and about closely related topics such as the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Linked Data, Graph Databases, Ontologies, etc. Offering a range of accessible examples and exercises, it can be used as a textbook for students and other newcomers to the field. It can also serve as a reference handbook for researchers and developers, as it offers up-to-date details on key standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL, SHACL, ShEx, RDB2RDF, LDP), along with formal definitions and references to further literature. The associated website webofdatabook.org offers a wealth of complementary material, including solutions to the exercises, slides for classes, raw data for examples, and a section for comments and questions.

The two main properties of the fractal antennas were investigated. Firstly, the self-similarity property was studied. The cavity model is used to analyze an equilateral triangular patch on a grounded dielectric substrate. A Matlab program was built to calculate the resonant frequencies, the input impedance, the reflection coefficient, etc. Then this triangular patch was used as the initiator of the Sierpinski Gasket fractal antenna with probe feeding. The first three iterations of this antenna were studied. These novel shapes include an air gap between the substrate and the ground plane, inverting the patch to reduce the dielectric loss and consequently increase the antenna efficiency and adding a shorting pin to improve the matching conditions as well as reducing the antenna size. Secondly, the space-filling property was studied and the rectangular microstrip patch was used as an initiator to all iterations. The first three iterations of a single pulse microstrip patch antenna were investigated. The second step was to study other shapes like the two pulses, NRZ (Non Return to Zero), Koch at angles 30o, 60o, 80o and 90o, Pulse 2.45 and Pulse 2.45 + Koch 90o microstrip antennas.

It is important to develop and incorporate the knowledge needed to design, construct, and maintain bridges to have the longest service life as possible. Consequently, the fatigue effects on bridges need to be considered and more accurately reflected within the proper bridge design specifications. This thesis describes the calibration process used to select the load and resistance factors for the fatigue limit states of steel bridge members within the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The process presented within this thesis builds upon work completed as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program No. 2 including the determination of the fatigue load model. The resistance model was developed using available fatigue test data and statistically analyzed using specially developed techniques. Load and resistance factors were finally chosen for both Fatigue I and Fatigue II service limit states. We expect the new load and resistance factors for the fatigue service limit states to more accurately capture the fatigue effects of steel bridges and thus increase their service life.

Onion is one of the most important commercial bulbous vegetable grown indifferent parts of the world. India is at 2nd position in world in onion production. The commonly used manual harvesting of onion is time consuming, less efficient and full of drudgery so the mechanization of harvesting is essentially needed. One of the main reasons of low productivity is insufficient man power availability on the farm and low level of farm mechanization. This is especially true for India. This prototype will be small and less costly compared to other harvesting machinery and provides efficient and effective method for harvesting to reduce human effort which is useful for small scale farmers. When the engine is started, the shaft starts to rotate along with the digger. The digger digs into the ground due to the rotation of the shaft. The assembled setup of digger carries the onion and throws it on to the conveyor. The conveyor is equipped with strips to hold the onion. The onion is carried by the conveyor and is deposited in the container. Due to motion of the machine the vibration is generated which in turn separates the soil from the onion.

Websites are most important for information dissemination in this technological era. One of the important factors for the success of any organization or institution is its websites. Academic websites provide information about universities, institutes and departments, resources and services, faculty members, students, alumni and others. A good and well designed academic website is not only an excellent media for publicizing the activities and services but also helps to bring it, to the notice of the users about all the significant information which they must know in using their products and services. The aim of the academic websites' study is to evaluate the level of accomplishment of required characteristics such as usability, functionality, reliability and efficiency comparing partial and global preferences. In this study, an attempt has been made to identify the credibility factors for academic websites with respect to user perspectives. Based on the credibility factors identified by the Library and Information Science professionals, the academic websites are assessed. The expectations of the academic websites were identified and opinions about credibility factors were evaluated.

In the last decades robots are expected to be of increasing intelligence to deal with a large range of tasks. Especially, robots are supposed to be able to learn manipulation skills from humans. To this end, a number of learning algorithms and techniques have been developed and successfully implemented for various robotic tasks. Among these methods, learning from demonstrations (LfD) enables robots to effectively and efficiently acquire skills by learning from human demonstrators, such that a robot can be quickly programmed to perform a new task.This book introduces recent results on the development of advanced LfD-based learning and control approaches to improve the robot dexterous manipulation. First, there's an introduction to the simulation tools and robot platforms used in the authors' research. In order to enable a robot learning of human-like adaptive skills, the book explains how to transfer a human user's arm variable stiffness to the robot, based on the online estimation from the muscle electromyography (EMG). Next, the motion and impedance profiles can be both modelled by dynamical movement primitives such that both of them can be planned and generalized for new tasks. Furthermore, the book introduces how to learn the correlation between signals collected from demonstration, i.e., motion trajectory, stiffness profile estimated from EMG and interaction force, using statistical models such as hidden semi-Markov model and Gaussian Mixture Regression. Several widely used human-robot interaction interfaces (such as motion capture-based teleoperation) are presented, which allow a human user to interact with a robot and transfer movements to it in both simulation and real-word environments. Finally, improved performance of robot manipulation resulted from neural network enhanced control strategies is presented. A large number of examples of simulation and experiments of daily life tasks are included in this book to facilitate better understanding of the readers.

A unique text integrating numerics, mathematics and applications to provide a hands-on approach to using optimization techniques, this mathematically accessible textbook emphasises conceptual understanding and importance of theorems rather than elaborate proofs. It allows students to develop fundamental optimization methods before delving into MATLAB(R)'s optimization toolbox, and to link MATLAB's results with the results from their own code. Following a practical approach, the text demonstrates several applications, from error-free analytic examples to truss (size) optimization, and 2D and 3D shape optimization, where numerical errors are inevitable. The principle of minimum potential energy is discussed to highlight the deep relationship between engineering and optimization. MATLAB code in every chapter illustrates key concepts and the text demonstrates the coupling between MATLAB and SOLIDWORKS(R) for design optimization. A wide variety of optimization problems are covered including constrained non-linear, linear-programming, least-squares, multi-objective, and global optimization problems.

Revision with unchanged content. This book investigates several research problems which arise in modern Web Information Retrieval. First of all we consider the fact that there are many situations where a flat list of ten search results are not enough, and that the users might desire to have a larger number of results grouped on-the-fly in folders of similar topics. In this book, we describe Snaket, a hierarchical clustering meta-search engine which personalizes searches according to the clusters selected on-the-fly by users. Second, we consider those situations where users might desire to access fresh information such as news articles. We present a new ranking algorithm suitable for ranking those fresh type of information. Third, we will discuss numerical methodologies for accelerating the ranking methodologies used in Web Search. An important achievement for this book is that we show how to address the above predominant issues of Web Information Retrieval by using clustering and ranking methodologies. We demonstrate that both clustering and ranking have a mutual reinforcement property that has not yet been studied intensively.

Revision with unchanged content. At first sight, browsing the World Wide Web is a fairly intuitive and simple activity, but it turns out that users often experience difficulties in finding the information and services that they are looking for - or in returning to items that they have visited before. In order to improve the current design of Web sites and Web browsers, or to provide users with personalized interfaces, one needs to know how users interact with the Web. Although theoretical models and empirical data exist, the knowledge that they provide is limited and scattered. In this book, we integrate current insights and extend this body of knowledge with a number of user studies. Several methods are presented for obtaining, clearing, analyzing and visualizing Web usage data. Various aspects of user navigation styles are discussed. Particular attention is given to the issue why, when and how often users return to Web pages, and how browsers can support this more effectively. An important observation is that the Web has evolved from a hypermedia system to a hybrid between hypermedia and interactive applications. This book targets researchers and professionals who want to better understand and support the users that visit their Web sites or that make use of their applications and tools.

The main objective of reducing the gap between processor speed and memory speed, is achieved by proposing customization techniques to the web caches. These techniques can enhance the performance of the traditional web cache replacement policies deployed at the client side browser caches. This concept can be extended to group of users, so that the cache deployed in intermediate stages can also be customized to cater to a group of users and for co-operative caches.

Revision with unchanged content. Meanwhile web-services are starting to be established through out the busi-ness world, but web-services only offer stateless operation calls. Since workflow management systems are widely accepted to execute long-term (stateful) business processes within companies, the next step of great interest is to make stateful cooperative processes available through the web, so that two or more partners can collaborate in a long-term business process. BPEL is a joint attempt of Microsoft and IBM to establish a standard to make such cooperative processes available through the web. We attempt to enhance robustness and flexibility of these processes by introducing quality cons-traints. The whole of all quality constraints referring to a process ins-tance should provide a frame, in which the flow of this process instance is correct. To prove the concept of our quality constraint approach called WEPD (Web-Flow Extended Process Description) we implemented MaX (Monitoring and eXception handling component). This book defines WEPD and explains the implementation of the monitoring component of MaX. It is written for computer science graduate students as well as IT professionals and IT mana-gers.

Revision with unchanged content. Web 2.0 is a common term in the Internet field nowadays. Services like Youtube or MySpace, which stand for the Internet of the second generation, have attracted attention on the consumer market. The company market on the other hand has not been strongly influenced by the new trend. But Web 2.0 could also be used to improve enterprise information technology. Exam-ples are Web 2.0 concepts, which increase the effectiveness of data handling or concepts, which provide new communication methods. Therefore the use of Web 2.0 concepts in an enterprise context seems worth considering. Claus-M. Menzel explains in this book how the Web 2.0 approach could be used in an enterprise context and why the adoption of Web 2.0 could be a benefit for companies. For this objective the essence of Web 2.0 will first be clarified, as well as why and how this concept is working. It will be deduced which Web 2.0 elements can be used within companies and how they need to be adjusted to be used there. Furthermore this book will introduce technologies and applications which can be used for the realisation of web 2.0 in companies and compare these with the common enterprise infor-mation technologies.

Inhaltlich unver瓣nderte Neuauflage. In den letzten Jahren erfuhren Web Services eine immer gr繹?ere Verbreitung. Mittlerweile ist es mit Hilfe von Prozessbeschreibungssprachen m繹glich, mehrere Web Services miteinander zu einem komplexen Web Service zu kombinieren. Urspr羹nglich wurden Web Services als Kommunikations- und Austauschform zwischen Softwareanwendungen konzipiert. Web Services unterst羹tzen damit in erster Linie B2B (Business-to-Business) Beziehungen. Mittlerweile ist aber auch die Anforderung entstanden, Web Services f羹r B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Beziehungen einzusetzen. Da die Nutzerinteraktion 羹ber ein Benutzerinterface erfasst werden muss, liegt die Problemstellung vor allem darin, abh瓣ngig vom Zustand des Gesch瓣ftsprozesses und je nach Ein- und Ausgabeparameter dynamisch eine passende und nutzerfreundliche Benutzerschnittstelle zu generieren. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, L繹sungen f羹r diese Problemstellung zu finden, zu evaluieren und anhand dieser Analyse ein Konzept vorzustellen, wie menschliche Benutzerinteraktionen in komplexen Web Services m繹glich sind.

A proposed Web Indexing Model Based on Metadata,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011366803?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=10,"Sarah,Hussein",Noor Publishing,9786202788823.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8823/9786202788823.jpg,"

The World Wide Web contains large volumes of Web pages that are poorly characterized in terms of both metadata and structure descriptions. Metadata is the data that describe data, for Web pages, it may provide a significant amount of information about the Web without examining its content and serves a variety of purposes. At the other side, the search engine needs to scrape all Web pages of the target Website, when a new Web page is first available, it will typically take several days-for the page to be detected and indexed by the search engine. Until a page has been indexed, the users cannot find information about it on search engine results. This represents a time and resource-consuming operation and heavy network bandwidth consumption involved with the retrieval of the mark-up code of these Web pages which finally affects the users by increasing the time taken for new content or a content modification to be reflected in the search engines results. For instance, Web-related metadata can improve search efficiency and the quality of the search results. This thesis proposes an approach called Multilateral Web Indexing Model (MWIM), which aims to describe a solution to the previous.

Revision with unchanged content. As Web-based interactive 3D graphics, popularly referred to as Virtual Reality (VR), continue to become more affordable, research and development groups in various fields have been adopting Web-based VR technology. Despite sub-stan-tial adoption, how and how much the technology benefits target users and the providers who choose to adapt the technology is not well un-der-stood. Previous research has established that VR provides users with unique human-computer interaction. However, little is known about how users ex-pe-rience the Web-based VR technology and how user-system interaction con-tri-bu-tes to system usability. This book investigates user perception of Web-based VR comparing to conventional 2D graphics and system usability affec-ted by the user-system interaction process. The impact of Web-based VR on sy-stem usability was empirically examined from an integrated view of tech-no-lo-gy acceptance in information systems and human-computer interaction. In addition, the impact of user characteristics on user-system interaction while using a VR system was examined. This book provides new knowledge about usability, sense of presence and tech-nology acceptance in VR and provides insights for future research, which should be important to anyone designing, developing and evaluating a VR system in general and to an electronic commerce or market research system in particular.

Revision with unchanged content. In the last years, the Web has become an invaluable source of information for almost every domain of knowledge. This has motivated researchers to considering the Web as a valid repository for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Acquisition. In this sense, Ontology Learning from web resources is a particularly interesting topic as Ontologies are required to achieve interoperability and information understanding in knowledge intensive environments such as the Semantic Web. This book analyzes the ontology construction process from the automatic learning point of view. It presents a novel approach for Ontology Learning, introducing new methods for knowledge acquisition from the Web. The adaptation of several learning techniques to the web corpus and the exploitation of particular characteristics of the Web environment composing an automatic, un-supervised and domain independent approach distinguishes the present proposal from previous works. The discussion, methods and results presented in this work should help researchers interested in taking profit from the information available in the Web and to create a consistent base of ontologies required for the Semantic Web.

Energy problems came to the attention of the world in 1973 as a result of the Arab oil embargo and the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Conservation and development of new energy sources or the expansions of existing sources were two major phases of energy programs. Energy conservation was of critical importance to the world; yet despite predictions of severe shortages, conservation attempts had not been entirely successful and great amounts of energy were still wasted. Greater energy efficiency was needed in cars and in electrical and gas equipment. Better insulated home and a general reduction in energy usage was essential. The world had to become less dependent on gas and oil as sources of energy.

Conceptual Design and Shape Optimization of a Pintle Nozzle,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c106355104?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=10,"Jithendra Sai Raja,Chada",Ingram      ,9786138943884.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3884/9786138943884.jpg,"

The nozzle is usually applied to accelerate and expand or compress the fluid. It is generally used to control the rate of flow, velocity, and pressure. The shape of the nozzle also plays a vital role in the process. Simply a nozzle is a tool that extracts the entering fluid which may be a gas or a liquid and rises its velocity. A nozzle can be a channel or canal or tube or pipe that helps in modifying the speed of the stream of fluid. We have convergent and divergent or both convergent-divergent types of nozzles. Ans also the varying cross-sections of the area of the nozzles affect the speed of the fluid. That means when the area of the nozzle is reduced the rate of nozzle fluid raises and in the same way as the area of the nozzle is raised or increased then the rate of nozzle fluid is reduced. The paper concentrate on the study of flow in nozzles. And the application of the nozzles for different shapes of pintle to increase the performance of propulsion.

Pakistan is facing the worst power crisis since last one decade and is passing through its worse economic conditions due to great losses to industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors. There is a dire need of electric power generation plants to fulfill the growing demand for electricity. Pakistan has plenty of potential from water, wind and solar, but the latter two are expensive and difficult to be included in national grid. However, the hydro potential can effectively be utilized either through building dams or run-of-river plants for electrical generation. Studies have shown that most of the villages in district Peshawar of KPK Province have canals with very small head, ranging from 1 to 10 meters. Effective utilization of low head to produce electrical power efficiently is a challenge. The purpose of this study is to implement a mini hydro power plant for remote areas of Pakistan.

This is our book on the Design of Automated JNSP System for Thin Film Device Applications. During my research, I was able to feel that enough work has already been done on the fabrication and characterization of thin films, but lesser research has been reported on improving the quality of thin films and the parameters necessary to isolate good quality thin films. So, we designed an automated jet nebulizer spray pyrolysis (JNSP) system and isolated certain parameters that are responsible for the better quality of thin films, and standardize the process for thin film deposition using automation. Zinc (Zn) doped copper oxide (CuO) thin films were deposited by manual and automated JNSP system and their characterization was compared for p-n junction diode application. To the best of our knowledge, the fabrication of p-Zn: CuO/n-Si diode using an automated JNSP system has been not much studied in the available literature except for a few. To a large extent, we are successful in this research which is presented in this book.

This richly illustrated book provides an overview of the design and analysis of experiments with a focus on non-clinical experiments in the life sciences, including animal research. It covers the most common aspects of experimental design such as handling multiple treatment factors and improving precision. In addition, it addresses experiments with large numbers of treatment factors and response surface methods for optimizing experimental conditions or biotechnological yields.The book emphasizes the estimation of effect sizes and the principled use of statistical arguments in the broader scientific context. It gradually transitions from classical analysis of variance to modern linear mixed models, and provides detailed information on power analysis and sample size determination, including 'portable power' formulas for making quick approximate calculations. In turn, detailed discussions of several real-life examples illustrate the complexities and aberrations that can arise in practice.Chiefly intended for students, teachers and researchers in the fields of experimental biology and biomedicine, the book is largely self-contained and starts with the necessary background on basic statistical concepts. The underlying ideas and necessary mathematics are gradually introduced in increasingly complex variants of a single example. Hasse diagrams serve as a powerful method for visualizing and comparing experimental designs and deriving appropriate models for their analysis. Manual calculations are provided for early examples, allowing the reader to follow the analyses in detail. More complex calculations rely on the statistical software R, but are easily transferable to other software.  Though there are few prerequisites for effectively using the book, previous exposure to basic statistical ideas and the software R would be advisable.

Game Design Deep Dive: Roguelikes examines the history and rise of the often-confusing roguelike genre. Despite being more than 30 years old, the roguelike genre remains a mystery to a lot of consumers and developers. Procedural generation, or having the game generate content, has been a cornerstone and point of complexity since its inception. The 2010s saw an explosion of new designs and examples, along with a debate about what a roguelike is. The genre found its way back to mainstream audiences with the award-winning Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Since then, roguelikes have revolutionized the way we see and design games. Author and game design critic Joshua Bycer explains the differences between the various roguelike designs and give a detailed blueprint showing what makes the best ones work.   The first of its kind talking about the roguelike genre　   Examines the design and methodology of roguelike games and the different variations   A high-level discussion and breakdown of procedural and random content generation  Joshua Bycer is a game design critic with more than seven years of experience critically analyzing game design and the industry itself. In that time, through Game-Wisdom, he has interviewed hundreds of game developers and members of the industry about what it means to design video games. He is also a public speaker and presenter at schools and libraries on game design and game development.

Web applications occupy a large space within the IT infrastructure of a business or a corporation. They simply just don't touch a front end or a back end; today's web apps impact just about every corner of it. Today's web apps have become complex, which has made them a prime target for sophisticated cyberattacks. As a result, web apps must be literally tested from the inside and out in terms of security before they can be deployed and launched to the public for business transactions to occur.  The primary objective of this book is to address those specific areas that require testing before a web app can be considered to be completely secure. The book specifically examines five key areas:    Network security: This encompasses the various network components that are involved in order for the end user to access the particular web app from the server where it is stored at to where it is being transmitted to, whether it is a physical computer itself or a wireless device (such as a smartphone).  Cryptography: This area includes not only securing the lines of network communications between the server upon which the web app is stored at and from where it is accessed from but also ensuring that all personally identifiable information (PII) that is stored remains in a ciphertext format and that its integrity remains intact while in transmission.  Penetration testing: This involves literally breaking apart a Web app from the external environment and going inside of it, in order to discover all weaknesses and vulnerabilities and making sure that they are patched before the actual Web app is launched into a production state of operation.  Threat hunting: This uses both skilled analysts and tools on the Web app and supporting infrastructure to continuously monitor the environment to find all security holes and gaps.  The Dark Web: This is that part of the Internet that is not openly visible to the public. As its name implies, this is the ""sinister"" part of the Internet, and in fact, where much of the PII that is hijacked from a web app cyberattack is sold to other cyberattackers in order to launch more covert and damaging threats to a potential victim.  Testing and Securing Web Applications breaks down the complexity of web application security testing so this critical part of IT and corporate infrastructure remains safe and in operation.

This book introduces several novel approaches to pave the way for the next generation of integrated circuits, which can be successfully and reliably integrated, even in safety-critical applications. The authors describe new measures to address the rising challenges in the field of design for testability, debug, and reliability, as strictly required for state-of-the-art circuit designs. In particular, this book combines formal techniques, such as the Satisfiability (SAT) problem and the Bounded Model Checking (BMC), to address the arising challenges concerning the increase in test data volume, as well as test application time and the required reliability. All methods are discussed in detail and evaluated extensively, while considering industry-relevant benchmark candidates. All measures have been integrated into a common framework, which implements standardized software/hardware interfaces.

Adaptive techniques play a key role in modern wireless communication systems. The concept of adaptation is emphasized in the Adaptation in Wireless Communications Series through a unified framework across all layers of the wireless protocol stack ranging from the physical layer to the application layer, and from cellular systems to next-generation wireless networks. Adaptation and Cross Layer Design in Wireless Networks is devoted to adaptation in the data link layer, network layer, and application layer. The book presents state-of-the-art adaptation techniques and methodologies, including cross-layer adaptation, joint signal processing, coding and networking, selfishness in mobile ad hoc networks, cooperative and opportunistic protocols, adaptation techniques for multimedia support, self -organizing routing, and tunable security services. It presents several new theoretical paradigms and analytical findings which are supported with various simulation and experimental results.Adaptation in wireless communications is needed in order to achieve high capacity and ubiquitous communications. The current trend in wireless communication systems is to make adaptation dependent upon the state of the relevant parameters in all layers of the system. Focusing on simplified cross layer design approaches, this volume describes advanced techniques such as adaptive resource management, adaptive modulation and coding, 4G communications, QoS, diversity combining, and energy and mobility aware MAC protocols. The first volume in the series, Adaptive Signal Processing in Wireless Communications (cat no.46012) covers adaptive signal processing at the physical layer.

The edited volume explores the topic of experiential walks, which is the practice of multi- or mono-sensory and in-motion immersion into an urban or natural environment. The act of walking is hence intended as a process of (re-)discovering, reflecting and learning through an embodied experience. Specific attention is devoted to the investigation of the ambiance of places and its dynamic atmospheric perception that contribute to generating the social experience. This topic is gaining increasing attention and has been studied in several forms in different disciplines to investigate the particular spatial, social, sensory and atmospheric character of places. The book contains chapters by experts in the field and covers both the theory and the practice of innovative methods, techniques, and technologies. It examines experiential walks in the perspective of an interdisciplinary approach to environmental and sensory urban design by organising the contributions according to three specific interrelated focuses, namely the exploration and investigation of the multisensory dimension of public spaces, the different ways to grasp and communicate the in-motion experience through traditional and novel forms of representation, and the application of the approach to urban participatory planning and higher education. Shedding new light on the topic, the book offers both a reference guide for those engaged in applied research, and a toolkit for professionals and students.

Enterprises have made amazing advances by taking advantage of data about their business to provide predictions and understanding of their customers, markets, and products. But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today. The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way. The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.

The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way. The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.

Revision with unchanged content. The wide adoption of XML and related technologies led to the rise of a new paradigm for applications development. Web Services: WS, extend the traditional role of the Web for a stronger support for business to business interactions. The WS paradigm is based on the exposure of WS functionality via an interface description which has the potential of making WS available for various kinds of end-users. Another very promising future of WS consists of the potential of composing basic WS to produce more complex WS with a wide range of functionalities. The SOA was proposed to position the key players in this new paradigm where main operations will be executed using technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. The management of Quality of Web services: QoWS, as integral part of WS management will play an important role for the success of this paradigm. In this work, we investigate the management of QoWS for basic and composite WS by taking it into consideration as part of a systematic process for the development of WS. We studied the development of a new framework that intends to capture major management operations and the necessary extensions of SOA to support QoWS management.

Revision with unchanged content. Descriptions of data in the Semantic Web easily grow larger and more complex than the descriptions of traditional web pages and are thus more difficult to handle. The problem of how to structure complex systems has been addressed in traditional software engineering for decades and is commonly solved by splitting systems into components using different techniques. Recently, new techniques, like Aspect-Oriented Programming or the more generic Invasive Software Composition, were developed to fulfill newly emerging composition needs. These gray-box composition approaches access components through a well-defined interface, but modify internal parts of components during composition. This book investigates in trans-ferring composition techniques from the software engineering to the semantic web domain using the concepts of Invasive Software Composition. It shows how composition operators can be defined for software, query and ontology composition alike and how they can be tailored for specific needs of the Semantic Web domain. This book targets software engineers, researchers and students interested in modern software composition techniques and the emerging challenges of the Semantic Web.

Design and Performance Evaluation of a Propeller,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c106367681?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=13,"Balaji Jayanth,Venkatesh",Ingram      ,9783847370116.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/0116/9783847370116.jpg,"

The selection of small-diameter propellers for Micro-Air Vehicle (MAV) applications are usually carried out arbitrarily due to non-existence of performance data. The presence of vast performance data for larger propellers cannot be applied to these small-diameter propellers that operate at low Reynolds numbers, and the aerodynamic performance data at these low Reynolds numbers seldom exists. Analytical method such as momentum-blade element theory together with computational methods such as CFD can be relied upon to design and optimise the performance of propellers of any class. In the current work, the design and performance evaluation of a propeller applicable to a MAV is carried out for a given thrust of 1 N, diameter of 120 mm and speed of 10,000 rpm. The design was based on one-dimensional momentum theory. Design modifications were done by varying the blade setting angle at 75% radius to enhance the performance of the propeller. As a result, the maximum efficiency was obtained for a blade setting angle of 40簞. Experimental data available in the literature were used to validate the CFD solution procedure applied to predict the performance characteristics of the propeller.

The frequent use of post-installed reinforcements to rehabilitate and strengthen existing buildings and other structures have made this technology increasingly important. The technology, which connects new structural components to existing concrete structures, offers flexibility in design and construction. The international market, however, has a paucity of guides for the design, installation, and quality control of post-installed reinforcements. Guide for Design, Installation, and Assessment of Post-Installed Reinforcements aims to address this gap by proposing a European approach to post-installed reinforcements combined with local design provisions, revealing the possibilities for post-installed reinforcements to designers, contractors, and building control bodies alike.

Revision with unchanged content. Relational.OWL is a technique to automatically convert a relational database into a Semantic Web representation, enabling Semantic Web applications to access data actually stored in relational databases using their own built-in functionality. Since this representation does not result in objects containing real semantics, we additionally show how to create mappings from the rela-tional model to a target ontology using an arbitrary closed RDF query language. Using current Semantic Web techniques, a formerly relational data item, once converted to its Semantic Web representation, can neither be identified unambiguously, nor be backtracked to its original storage location in the relational database. We hence introduce a novel URI scheme for identifying not only databases, but also their schema and data components like tables or columns, giving us the possibility to specify the exact and identifying storage location of any data item in its original data source.

Concepts and Methods for a Librarian of the Web,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200321666?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=14,"Mario,Kubek",Springer    ,9783030231385.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1385/9783030231385.jpg,"

The World Wide Web can be considered a huge library that in consequence needs a capable librarian responsible for the classification and retrieval of documents as well as the mediation between library resources and users. Based on this idea, the concept of the ""Librarian of the Web"" is introduced which comprises novel, librarian-inspired methods and technical solutions to decentrally search for text documents in the web using peer-to-peer technology.The concept's implementation in the form of an interactive peer-to-peer client, called ""WebEngine"", is elaborated on in detail. This software extends and interconnects common web servers creating a fully integrated, decentralised and self-organising web search system on top of the existing web structure. Thus, the web is turned into its own powerful search engine without the need for any central authority.This book is intended for researchers and practitioners having a solid background in the fields of Information Retrieval and Web Mining.

Design is the creative invention to produce anything and everything. Textile design is essentially the process of creating designs for fabrics and it might be woven, knitted or printed fabrics or surface ornamentation. Textiles are basically made to be decorative and are used to embellish and decorate both people and objects. The requisite structure of the fabric as well as its ornamentation, ie, the desired design is responsible to create the desired product.With their knowledge, skill and creativity, textile designers are responsible for producing appropriate and feasible designs for different end products with diverse applications. However, there is at present no fundamental and comprehensive book dealing with all aspects of textile design, including primary, advanced or allied designs.

Modeling Web Services with UML 2.0,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200305823?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=14,"Nickolas,Landry",Wiley       ,9780471227137.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7137/9780471227137.jpg,"

Web services are self-contained applications that can be located on and invoked over the Internet. Because web services are built with standards such as XML, SOAP, UDDI, and WSDL, they are platform-neutral. For example, a sales rep may visit a local buyer who wants to order 10 copies of a book. Rather than waiting until he gets back to the office to place the order, the sales rep can review the inventory of the warehouse on his PDA using a web service and place the order immediately. If the local warehouse is short on inventory, another web service can search other distributors and their inventory and present alternate warehouses and quantities from which the sales rep can choose. The rep can select an option, and place the order via the web service.  The OMG's Unified Modeling Language, UML 2.0,  is a standard language for modeling software systems. The specifications for UML 2.0 is expected to be approved in first quarter 2003.

Design for Sustainability,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200304026?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=14,"S M,Sapuan",Elsevier    ,9780128194829.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4829/9780128194829.jpg,"

Design for sustainability is one of the primary focuses in human advancement nowadays, with the aim of developing products and services that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Yet, total implementation of sustainable design is yet to be achieved in practice due to a lack of practical information on how the philosophy can be implemented. Design for Sustainability: Green Materials and Processes addresses this need by providing fundamental and practical knowledge to readers especially for product development applications throughout the entire life cycle - ranging from conceptual design, material and manufacturing process selection, as well as environmental life cycle assessment. In addition, several topics covering recent advances in the application of sustainable design within the automotive, building and construction, packaging and consumer product industries are also included in this book to provide practical examples of this philosophy in current applications. Lastly, a section on implementation of design for sustainability in education is also added to aid readers whom wish to introduce in practice this philosophy especially to younger students. The book will be beneficial to researchers, students in higher education institutions, design practitioners and engineers in private and public sector organization with aspirations to develop sustainable products in the future.

Website security made easy. This book covers the most common ways websites get hacked and how web developers can defend themselves. Every website today is vulnerable to attack and a compromised website can ruin a company's reputation. Consider the Heartland Payment System data breach of 2008: the Heartland attackers made off with 130 million credit card numbers using a SQL injection attack to gain access to the web-servers that handled payment data. Web Security for Developers covers everything a web developer needs to know about web security. Readers will learn who attackers are and what they have at their disposal, how the Internet and websites operate, and various ways websites get attacked. Author Malcolm McDonald explores common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, as well as common vulnerabilities like information leakage. The first half of the book describes security concepts every developer should know while the second half delves into the individual vulnerabilities themselves, offering real-world examples and code samples.

Design for testability techniques offer one approach toward alleviating this situation by adding enough extra circuitry to a circuit or chip to reduce the complexity of testing.Today's computers must perform with increasing reliability, which in turn depends on the problem of determining whether a circuit has been manufactured properly or behaves correctly. However, the greater circuit density of VLSI circuits and systems has made testing more difficult and costly. This book notes that one solution is to develop faster and more efficient algorithms to generate test patterns or use design techniques to enhance testability - that is, design for testability. Design for testability techniques offer one approach toward alleviating this situation by adding enough extra circuitry to a circuit or chip to reduce the complexity of testing. Because the cost of hardware is decreasing as the cost of testing rises, there is now a growing interest in these techniques for VLSI circuits.The first half of the book focuses on the problem of testing: test generation, fault simulation, and complexity of testing. The second half takes up the problem of design for testability: design techniques to minimize test application and/or test generation cost, scan design for sequential logic circuits, compact testing, built-in testing, and various design techniques for testable systems.Logic Testing and Design for Testability is included in the Computer Systems Series, edited by Herb Schwetman.

The idea was to address on the one hand foundations and computational aspects of query answering, in formalisms, methods and technology, and on the other hand to also spotlight some rising or emerging application fields relating to the Semantic Web in which query answering plays a role, and which by their nature also pose new challenges and problems for this task; linked stream processing, geospatial data, semantic wikis, and argumentation on the web fall in this category.

Design-Centered Introduction to Aerospace Engineering,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c103752482?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=15,"Narayanan M,Komerath",Scv Inc,9781949335002.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5002/9781949335002.jpg,"

This book is the product of a course that was developed to meet a horrifying requirement: introduce Aerospace Engineering a.k.a. Rocket Science to students who are fresh out of high school. Assume no background in Calculus, Graphics, Computing, or College Physics or Chemistry. Well, the Wright Brothers did not have A.E. degrees either, and they flew just fine, in a craft that still amazes designers. Several senior students taking Aircraft Design helped me with the standards that had to be met; a book received as birthday present told me the specifications of a new airliner. Advice at a party on Why First-Year Students Are Different, came in very handy indeed. On the first day, several senior colleagues populated the back row of the auditorium, purportedly to learn but possibly in anticipation of seeing me falling on my face. The students were told that they would be ""flying"" their own airliner designs inside 6 weeks. Whatever they thought of that, they just smiled. And did it. So can you. Hundreds of aerospace engineers have gone through the decades of course experience that now provide the backdrop of this book. The key is for the learner to have a certain amount of faith that there is a method to what looks like madness. It is undeniable that many students who come through the Introduction course, then and now, do better designs, and demonstrate more comfort in the basic disciplines, than what the Seniors could do in a prior era. Somewhere along the way students got tired of designing transonic airliners, and wanted to go straight into their own supersonic planes and spacecraft - and so they did. There is no magic here: just a simplified explanation of how requirements are laid out, a first ""guess"" is made, and how that that is used to successively reduce uncertainty about every part of the vehicle and its life-cycle. The rigorous analysis that comes in the various disciplines of aerospace engineering, is glimpsed but not allowed to drown the learner at this stage. If the book succeeds, perhaps it may inspire a designer who will make the next generation of supersonic airliners happen. Among many other dreams that await determined effort to realize them.

Object-Oriented Design Choices,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c103232287?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=15,"Adair,Dingle",CRC Press,9780367820817.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/0817/9780367820817.jpg,"

Do modern programming languages, IDEs, and libraries make coding easy? Maybe, but coding is not design. Large-scale or expensive apps clearly require evaluation of design choices. Still, software design directly impacts code reuse and longevity even for small-scale apps with limited overhead. This text evaluates and contrasts common object-oriented designs. A given problem may have many solutions. A developer may employ different design techniques - composition, inheritance, dependency injection, delegation, etc. - to solve a particular problem. A skilled developer can determine the costs and benefits of different design responses, even amid competing concerns. A responsible developer documents design choices as a contract with the client, delineating external and internal responsibilities. To promote effective software design, this book examines contractual, object-oriented designs for immediate and sustained use as well as code reuse. The intent of identifying design variants is to recognize and manage conflicting goals such as short versus long-term utility, stability versus flexibility, and storage versus computation. Many examples are given to evaluate and contrast different solutions and to compare C# and C++ effects. No one has a crystal ball; however, deliberate design promotes software longevity. With the prominence of legacy OO code, a clear understanding of different object-oriented designs is essential. Design questions abound. Is code reuse better with inheritance or composition? Should composition rely on complete encapsulation? Design choices impact flexibility, efficiency, stability, longevity, and reuse, yet compilers do not enforce design and syntax does not necessarily illustrate design. Through deliberate design, or redesign when refactoring, developers construct sustainable, efficient code.

Hybrid Atomic-Level Interface Design for Materials Functionality covers a broad range of atomistic, meso and macro scale computational methodologies, including multiphase (hybrid) materials constructs for tailoring structural, thermal and electrical properties. As future materials are expected to perform with increasing efficiency in complex and dynamic environments hybrid materials design, in contrast to monolithic concepts, they are a cost-effective alternative. Taking materials hybridization at smaller scale, even at atomic scale, offers exceedingly high-payoff opportunities for optimizing materials functionality at reduced material consumption and even reduced qualification costs (eliminates many costly component and system level qualification tests).

Object-Oriented Design Choices,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c102115132?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=16,"Adair,Dingle",CRC Press,9780367820183.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/0183/9780367820183.jpg,"

Do modern programming languages, IDEs, and libraries make coding easy? Maybe, but coding is not design. Large-scale or expensive apps clearly require evaluation of design choices. Still, software design directly impacts code reuse and longevity even for small-scale apps with limited overhead. This text evaluates and contrasts common object-oriented designs. A given problem may have many solutions. A developer may employ different design techniques - composition, inheritance, dependency injection, delegation, etc. - to solve a particular problem. A skilled developer can determine the costs and benefits of different design responses, even amid competing concerns. A responsible developer documents design choices as a contract with the client, delineating external and internal responsibilities. To promote effective software design, this book examines contractual, object-oriented designs for immediate and sustained use as well as code reuse. The intent of identifying design variants is to recognize and manage conflicting goals such as short versus long-term utility, stability versus flexibility, and storage versus computation. Many examples are given to evaluate and contrast different solutions and to compare C# and C++ effects. No one has a crystal ball; however, deliberate design promotes software longevity. With the prominence of legacy OO code, a clear understanding of different object-oriented designs is essential. Design questions abound. Is code reuse better with inheritance or composition? Should composition rely on complete encapsulation? Design choices impact flexibility, efficiency, stability, longevity, and reuse, yet compilers do not enforce design and syntax does not necessarily illustrate design. Through deliberate design, or redesign when refactoring, developers construct sustainable, efficient code.

This book seeks to generalize techniques and experiences in designing and analyzing cryptographic schemes for blockchain. It devotes three chapters to review the background and basic knowledge, four chapters to discuss specific types of cryptographic primitive design for blockchain, one chapter to discuss optimization tools and another chapter for blockchain regulation and economies. This book covers the systematic survey of research objects, as well as detailed reviews of cryptographic schemes, lectures and methodologies to practice cryptography.The main findings of this book are summarized as following, first, the practical design and analysis of cryptographic schemes for blockchain can address major problems in blockchain at algorithmic level. Then, some intrinsic deficiencies in some traditional cryptographic primitives, like centralized setup, impractical design, etc, prevent the successful application of these primitives in blockchain. However, huge efforts are being made to make these primitives practical and applicable for researchers. Finally, the formal and rigorous design and analysis of public key cryptographic algorithms is vital to blockchain. Design and Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms in Blockchain is a useful textbook for graduate students and PhD students, or researches who wish to connect cryptography with blockchain for research and developing projects.

Most professional programmers that I've encountered are not well prepared to tacklealgorithmdesignproblems.Thisisapity, becausethetechniquesofalgorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, e?cient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge: - Techniques - Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental - gorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth-?rst search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most - portantdesigntechniqueismodeling, theartofabstractingamessyreal-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack. - Resources - Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. Ratherthanlaboringfromscratchtoproduceanewalgorithmforeverytask, they can ?gure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing imp- mentations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide su?cient source material to model most any application. This book is intended as a manual on algorithm design, providing access to combinatorial algorithm technology for both students and computer professionals.

This book addresses issues pertinent to mechanics and stress generation, especially in recent advanced cases of technology developments, spanning from micrometer interconnects in solar photovoltaics (PV), next-gen energy storage devices to multilayers of nano-scale composites enabling novel stretchable/flexible conductor technologies. In these cases, the mechanics of materials have been pushed to the extreme edges of human knowledge to enable cutting-edge, unprecedented functionalities and technological innovations. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction, in situ small-scale mechanical testing combined with physics-based computational modeling/simulation, has been widely used approaches to probe these mechanics of the materials at their extreme limits due to their recently discovered distinct advantages. The techniques discussed in this manuscript are highlights specially curated from the broad body of work recently reported in the literature, especially ones that the author had led the pursuits at the frontier himself. Extreme stress generation in these advanced material leads to often new failure modes, and hence, the reliability of the final product is directly affected. From the recent topics and various advanced case studies covered in this book, the reader gets an updated knowledge of how new mechanics can and has been applied in Design-for-Reliability (DfR) for some of the latest technological innovations known in our modern world. Further, this also helps in building better designs, which may avoid the pitfalls of the current practiced trends.

This book provides a comprehensive overview of the design, generation and characterization of minimal cell systems. Written by leading experts, it presents an in-depth analysis of the current issues and challenges in the field, including recent advances in the generation and characterization of reduced-genome strains generated from model organisms with relevance in biotechnology, and basic research such as Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and yeast. It also discusses methodologies, such as bottom-up and top-down genome minimization strategies, as well as novel analytical and experimental approaches to characterize and generate minimal cells. Lastly, it presents the latest research related to minimal cells of serveral microorganisms, e.g. Bacillus subtilis.The design of biological systems for biotechnological purposes employs strategies aimed at optimizing specific tasks. This approach is based on enhancing certain biological functions while reducing other capacities that are not required or that could be detrimental to the desired objective. A highly optimized cell factory would be expected to have only the capacity for reproduction and for performing the expected task. Such a hypothetical organism would be considered a minimal cell. At present, numerous research groups in academia and industry are exploring the theoretical and practical implications of constructing and using minimal cells and are providing valuable fundamental insights into the characteristics of minimal genomes, leading to an understanding of the essential gene set. In addition, research in this field is providing valuable information on the physiology of minimal cells and their utilization as a biological chassis to which useful biotechnological functions can be added.

Model Uncertainties in Foundation Design is unique in the compilation of the largest and the most diverse load test databases to date, covering many foundation types (shallow foundations, spudcans, driven piles, drilled shafts, rock sockets and helical piles) and a wide range of ground conditions (soil to soft rock).  All databases with names prefixed by NUS are available upon request. This presents the most comprehensive evaluation of the model factor mean (bias) and coefficient of variation (COV) for ultimate and serviceability limit state based on these databases. They can be used directly for AASHTO LRFD calibration.  The authors provide the most complete literature survey of performance databases for other geo-structures and their model factor statistics. A practical three-tier scheme for classifying model uncertainty according to the model factor mean and COV is proposed. This empirically grounded scheme can underpin the calibration of resistance factors as a function of the degree of understanding - a concept already adopted in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code and the new draft for Eurocode 7 Part 1 (EN 1997-1:202x). The helical pile research in Chapter 7 was recognised by the 2020 ASCE Norman Medal.

The Chair Eco-design of buildings and infrastructure, a partnership between three engineering colleges (MINES ParisTech, Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and AgroParisTech) and the VINCI group, aims to create measurement and simulation tools which integrate all the dimensions of eco-design (greenhouse gas emissions, impact on biodiversity and resource levies, etc.) to become real decision-making tools, based on a scientific approach, for all actors in the city (designers, builders and users).This book reviews the second five-year sequence of the Chair, first presenting methodological advances in eco-design: life cycle assessment and quantification of uncertainties; local environmental impacts of transport and biodiversity. The interdisciplinary partnership, also associating the human sciences, shows its interest in taking into account the human factor in the modelling of urban systems. This modelling is based on several numerical simulation tools, presented in the third part. This theoretical set results in more substantial proposals for the renewal of techniques and systems, in terms of energy management strategies in buildings, urban agriculture, participatory data collection and digital transformation in transport. This book is intended for urban planners, local authorities, building owners, architects, design offices, companies, building managers, teacher-researchers and anyone interested in the environmental quality of our living spaces.

Adaptive survey designs (ASDs) provide a framework for data-driven tailoring of data collection procedures to different sample members, often for cost and bias reduction. People vary in how likely they are to respond and in how they respond. This variation leads to opportunities to selectively deploy design features in order to control both nonresponse and measurement errors. ASD aims at the optimal matching of design features and the characteristics of respondents given the survey budget. Such a goal is sensible, but ASD requires investment in more advanced technical systems and management infrastructure and asks for the collection of relevant auxiliary data. So what are current best practices in ASD? And is ASD worthwhile when the same auxiliary data are employed in the estimation afterwards? In this book, the authors provide answers to these questions, and much more.

Future requirements for computing speed, system reliability, and cost-effectiveness entail the development of alternative computers to replace the traditional von Neumann organization. As computing networks come into being, one of the latest dreams is now possible - distributed computing. Distributed computing brings transparent access to as much computer power and data as the user needs for accomplishing any given task - simultaneously achieving high performance and reliability.The subject of distributed computing is diverse, and many researchers are investigating various issues concerning the structure of hardware and the design of distributed software. Distributed System Design defines a distributed system as one that looks to its users like an ordinary system, but runs on a set of autonomous processing elements (PEs) where each PE has a separate physical memory space and the message transmission delay is not negligible. With close cooperation among these PEs, the system supports an arbitrary number of processes and dynamic extensions.Distributed System Design outlines the main motivations for building a distributed system, including: inherently distributed applications performance/cost resource sharing flexibility and extendibility availability and fault tolerance scalabilityPresenting basic concepts, problems, and possible solutions, this reference serves graduate students in distributed system design as well as computer professionals analyzing and designing distributed/open/parallel systems.Chapters discuss:  the scope of distributed computing systems general distributed programming languages and a CSP-like distributed control description language (DCDL) expressing parallelism, interprocess communication and synchronization, and fault-tolerant design two approaches describing a distributed system: the time-space view and the interleaving view mutual exclusion and related issues, including election, bidding, and self-stabilization prevention and detection of deadlock reliability, safety, and security as well as various methods of handling node, communication, Byzantine, and software faults efficient interprocessor communication mechanisms as well as these mechanisms without specific constraints, such as adaptiveness, deadlock-freedom, and fault-tolerance virtual channels and virtual networks load distribution problems synchronization of access to shared data while supporting a high degree of concurrency

Flexible PackagingA technical guide for narrow- and mid-web converters,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c007124378?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=18,"Ellison,Chris",Tarsus Exhibitions & Publishing ,9781910507216.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7216/9781910507216.jpg,"

Flexible packaging today has one of the highest growth rates across all printing sectors, achieving an annual global growth of close to five percent. Important trends include smaller run lengths, a requirement for multi-versions and variations, personalization and a growing interest in adding in-line value ‒ all undoubted opportunities for narrow- and mid-web label converters (using both flexo and digital technology) to capture a growing portion of the flexibles market.Jobs with the shortest run sizes are in pouches of any kind, as well as in single serve and one-dose packs and sachets. These are key areas where label converters can most readily enter the flexible packaging market. Indeed, narrower and mid-web conventional and digital printing has effectively opened up the market to a whole range of new customers who have never previously had a solution for short-run flexible packaging orders.But it's not all quite straightforward for a label converter to move into flexible packaging. They need to have a comprehensive understanding of paper, foil and filmic substrates ‒ as well as multi-layer constructions and barrier properties, of pack sealing, and of the specific user requirements needed for the many different types of liquids, powders, gels, creams and solids that have to be packaged. Pre-press requirements are different, inks have to withstand sealing, web- and sealing widths are important, co-efficient of slip can be critical, while a good understanding of form, fill and seal machines is ideal.This book has set out to provide both the knowledge and expert guidance for label and other converters looking to enter or expand their production into flexible packaging ‒ a key stepping stone to success.Chapters include:   Flexible packaging - an introductionPaper and board, metallic foil, films and multi-layer constructionsTypes of flexible packaging and special constructionsPre-press, printing and convertingUnderstanding forming, filling, sealing and lidding operationsMarkets, applications and opportunities

This book presents a comprehensive optimization-based theory and framework that exploits the synergistic interactions and tradeoffs between process design and operational decisions that span different time scales. Conventional methods in the process industry often isolate decision making mechanisms with a hierarchical information flow to achieve tractable problems, risking suboptimal, even infeasible operations. In this book, foundations of a systematic model-based strategy for simultaneous process design, scheduling, and control optimization is detailed to achieve reduced cost and improved energy consumption in process systems. The material covered in this book is well suited for the use of industrial practitioners, academics, and researchers. In Chapter 1, a historical perspective on the milestones in model-based design optimization techniques is presented along with an overview of the state-of-the-art mathematical tools to solve the resulting complex problems. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss two fundamental concepts that are essential for the reader. These concepts are (i) mixed integer dynamic optimization problems and two algorithms to solve this class of optimization problems, and (ii) developing a model based multiparametric programming model predictive control. These tools are used to systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between different time-scale decisions based on a single high-fidelity model, as demonstrated on (i) design and control, (ii) scheduling and control, and (iii) design, scheduling, and control problems. We present illustrative examples on chemical processing units, including continuous stirred tank reactors, distillation columns, and combined heat and power regeneration units, along with discussions of other relevant work in the literature for each class of problems.

Microsoft Dynamics GP is a popular enterprise resource planning (ERP) application used by tens of thousands of sites around the world to keep the accounting, financial, distribution and manufacturing functions running day in and day out.To do this Microsoft Dynamics GP was accessed via client software installed directly on the user's computer, or a terminal server. Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013 saw the introduction of a second type of client with which Microsoft Dynamics GP could be accessed; the web client. In 2016 this was rewritten into fully-responsive HTML5+CSS making it even more accessible. The installation of the web client is a little more complex than that of the classic desktop client.This book provides guidance for the implementation of the Microsoft Dynamics GP web client with step-by-step guides, illustrations and links to useful resources.

This second edition of the book Green Web-II - Standards and Perspectives from the IUCN Program / Policy Development in Environment Conservation Domain: with reference to India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh investigates the IUCN's role in global biodiversity conservation policy as well as in national program development in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. It explores how nature protection priorities and approaches are promoted or addressed by IUCN, and how environment conservation policies are created and maintained in states of South Asia with different capacities. It also evaluates IUCN's competency in biodiversity, climate change, nature conservation and environmental policy formulation at the global, regional and country levels. This book adds to our knowledge firstly by contributing to a small but growing body of work on the sociology of international organizations. International Governmental Organizations (IGOs), have previously been mainly the subject of political science. Secondly, it critically explores one of the largest and most active nature conservation organizations in the world. Thirdly, it also explores how IUCN actually goes about building protectoral programs with individual member nations. Finally, the research also shows the historical development of global institutions and IUCN's activities with member nations in helping to define or redefine the concept of global governance. The outcomes of this research will also be beneficial for global collaboration, networking, and for the identification of common concerns among the many environmental and conservational organizations at the international and national level. In this broader sense, the research outcomes might be beneficial to constituencies of the global North as well as global South because of the nature and coverage of IUCN and its role in conservation policy formation. This effort may serve as a model for additional research on international organizations.  Technical topics discussed in the book include: The Motivation for Environmental Conservation- How personal efforts make a differenceThe Role of International Environment Conservation OrganizationsThe Political Economy of Organizations, Network theory, Institutional theory, Stakeholder theory, Governance theoryGovernance performance and Competitiveness Popularity indicesKnowledge creation and diffusionConservation commons

Statistical Methods for Survival Trial Design: With Applications to Cancer Clinical Trials Using R provides a thorough presentation of the principles of designing and monitoring cancer clinical trials in which time-to-event is the primary endpoint. Traditional cancer trial designs with time-to-event endpoints are often limited to the exponential model or proportional hazards model. In practice, however, those model assumptions may not be satisfied for long-term survival trials. This book is the first to cover comprehensively the many newly developed methodologies for survival trial design, including trial design under the Weibull survival models; extensions of the sample size calculations under the proportional hazard models; and trial design under mixture cure models, complex survival models, Cox regression models, and competing-risk models. A general sequential procedure based on the sequential conditional probability ratio test is also implemented for survival trial monitoring. All methodologies are presented with sufficient detail for interested researchers or graduate students.

Design is a challenge for most developers. Without a background or training in user interface skills, it's hard to navigate what choices make the best sense for the end user. This book shows you how to migrate from Storyboards to SwiftUI to design dynamic and engaging UIs for iOS apps. SwiftUI is new in iOS 13 but you may want to support past versions as well. To satisfy this, you'll start by reviewing nib/xib files and Storyboards and then move into SwiftUI and explore how to design apps in both UI toolkits. Gaining a firm base in technologies old and new will allow you to future proof your UI during this period of transition. Developers generally want to stay in code, but UI development tends to be a visual effort. This book takes a very structured and code-like approach to UI design to take the fear away. You'll grasp Storyboards and Auto-Layout/Constraints, while also learning to move past them with the easier options in SwiftUI. A clear understanding of both technologies is key to keeping your most functional coding and also making things look right.

This book is written for students and practicing engineers involved in the design of magnetic and electromechanical devices. The material presented is a compilation of the practical approaches used over the author's 37-year career at Eaton Research Labs and is intended to help the reader gain a feel for locations and strengths of magnetic fields and an intuitive insight into what magnetic fields do and how to use them. This book makes magnetics easy to understand and practical to apply in magnetic research, experimentation, and analysis of magnetic fields encountered in engineering challenges. Accurate and reliable methods are presented for the design of magnetic sensors, actuators, controls, and other electromechanical devices with the notable exclusion of rotating machines that are well covered by various authors and courses in university Electrical Engineering departments. Actuators, solenoids, and magnetic sensors have been around in various forms for over a century, and they are critical components of control and protection systems including relays and circuit breakers. This book has a strong foundation in the methods developed by H. C. Roters with additional topics in the areas of permanent magnet materials and permanent magnet performance in particular. The methodologies also take full advantage of complex spreadsheet capabilities, as well as finite element analysis as a counterpart to the calculations. Design examples include calculations for losses and temperature rise, which are critical for all electromagnetic systems. The smallest design usually has the highest temperature rise. The best design usually considers the trade-off between size and temperature rise. The design calculations presented are practical in the sense that they can be quickly and accurately applied in a spreadsheet model using the permeance method (also known as reluctance method or magnetic circuit method). The permeance method evaluates the magnetic field from the perspective of a magnetic circuit, analogous to an electric circuit. Chapter 1 describes this in detail and aims to provide an understanding of magnetic flux paths based on the simple question, If I were a magnetic flux line, where would I go? The accuracy of the permeance method is demonstrated with comparisons to measurements and finite element simulations. Practical methods also address the issues of time and effort. Some ideas need only feasibility level accuracy, while other design-specific challenges require high-level accuracy. This relates directly to budget and schedule issues on engineering projects. Increased effort (model detail, complexity, size, time) is needed to achieve increased accuracy. The best strategic approach is to use a method that is quick and provides enough accuracy to make a valid design decision. A spectrum of calculation methods can be considered 1) a hand calculation, 2) a simple spreadsheet model, 3) a complex spreadsheet model, 4) a 2D or axisymmetric finite element model, 5) a 3D finite element model. A spreadsheet model can also be used to quickly determine the starting size for a finite element model. A critical step for gaining confidence in the validity of any analysis is to check the results against those of a simple calculation. In general, when doing a complex analysis (such as a finite element simulation), the first step should be a simple calculation (such as a spreadsheet calculation) and a visualization of the magnetic field. The finite element simulation results can then be quickly reviewed for the shape of the magnetic field and the magnitude of the flux density, current and force, to judge if the results are reasonable. Finite element models have many input values and boundary conditions that are prone to typographical errors (such as a decimal point error, or a dimensional units error). Errors can be quickly detected when compared to a simple calculation and magnetic field visualization.

The current learning environment is substantially different than what existed for most of the 20th century. Learners and teachers today must navigate in perpetually changing contexts where education is influenced by technological advancement and obsolescence, economic barriers, a changing employment landscape, and even international politics. Studies indicate that employers seek to hire graduates with strong skills in areas coalescing around international awareness, creativity, communication, leadership, and teamwork. Skills and experiences in these areas are necessary preparation for the current economy and to pursue jobs that do not exist yet, while providing some insulation against the obsolescence of industries that lack these characteristics. These interpersonal skills are not often the subject of students' degrees, yet there are opportunities in online education to cultivate them. With increased interest in new career options comes the need to reconsider how to teach subjects in the increasingly online environment. Advancing Online Course Design and Pedagogy for the 21st Century Learning Environment is a critical reference book that navigates today's dynamic education requirements and provides examples of how online learning can foster growth in skill areas necessary for career advancement through effective course design. Moreover, it helps educators gain insight into online pedagogy and course design for the 21st century learner and prepares them to convert traditional courses and enhance existing online courses, thereby supporting students' growth and development in the highly dynamic online learning environment.

This book provides a detailed ""how-to"" guide, addressing aspects ranging from analysis and design to the implementation of applications, which need to be integrated within legacy applications and databases.The analysis and design of the next generation of software architectures must address the new requirements to accommodate the Internet of things (IoT), cybersecurity, blockchain networks, cloud, and quantum computer technologies. As 5G wireless increasingly establishes itself over the next few years, moving legacy applications into these new architectures will be critical for companies to compete in a consumer-driven and social media-based economy. Few organizations, however, understand the challenges and complexities of moving from a central database legacy architecture to a ledger and networked environment.The challenge is not limited to just designing new software applications. Indeed, the next generation needs to function more independently on various devices, and on more diverse and wireless-centric networks. Furthermore, databases must be broken down into linked list-based blockchain architectures, which will involve analytic decisions regarding which portions of data and metadata will be processed within the chain, and which ones will be dependent on cloud systems. Finally, the collection of all data throughout these vast networks will need to be aggregated and used for predictive analysis across a variety of competitive business applications in a secured environment. Certainly not an easy task for any analyst/designer!Many organizations will continue to use packaged products and open-source applications. These third-party products will need to be integrated into the new architecture paradigms and have seamless data aggregation capabilities, while maintaining the necessary cyber compliances. The book also clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved, including the IT departments, users, executive sponsors, and third-party vendors. The book's structure also provides a step-by-step method to help ensure a higher rate of success in the context of re-engineering existing applications and databases, as well as selecting third-party products, conversion methods and cybercontrols. It was written for use by a broad audience, including IT developers, software engineers, application vendors, business line managers, and executives.

This book illustrates the computational framework based on knowledge of flow and mass transfer together with optimization techniques to solve problems relevant to micromixing technology. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the different numerical techniques applied to the design of micromixers. Flow and mixing analysis is based on both the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches; relative advantages and disadvantages of the two methods and suitability to different types of mixing problems are analysed. The book also discusses the various facets of numerical schemes subjected to discretization errors and computational grid requirements. Since a large number of studies are based on commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages, relevant details of these packages to the mixing problem using them are presented. Numerical optimization techniques coupled with CFD analysis of flow and mixing have proved to be an important tool for micromixers design, and therefore, are an important part of the book. These techniques are presented briefly, and focus is on surrogate modeling and optimization applied to design of micromixers.

The updating process is usually achieved using a standardized approach consisting of collecting and processing information through acoustic models to produce the updated noise maps. This procedure is time consuming and costly, and has a significant impact on the financial statement of the authorities responsible for providing the maps. Furthermore, the END requires that easy-to-read noise maps are made available to the public to provide information on noise levels and the subsequent actions to be undertaken by local and central authorities to reduce noise impacts. In order to update the noise maps more easily and in a more effective way, it is convenient to design an integrated system incorporating real-time noise measurement and signal processing to identify and analyze the noise sources present in the mapping area (e.g., road traffic noise, leisure noise, etc.) as well as to automatically generate and present the corresponding noise maps. This wireless acoustic sensor network design requires transversal knowledge, from accurate hardware design for acoustic sensors to network structure design and management of the information with signal processing to identify the origin of the measured noise and graphical user interface application design to present the results to end users. This book is collection in which several views of methodology and technologies required for the development of an efficient wireless acoustic sensor network from the first stages of its design to the tests conducted during deployment, its final performance, and possible subsequent implications for authorities in terms of the definition of policies. Contributions include several LIFE and H2020 projects aimed at the design and implementation of intelligent acoustic sensor networks with a focus on the publication of good practices for the design and deployment of intelligent networks in other locations.

The costs of inadequate earthquake engineering are huge, especially for reinforced concrete buildings. This book presents the principles of earthquake-resistant structural engineering, and uses the latest tools and techniques to give practical design guidance to address single or multiple seismic performance levels. It presents an elegant, simple and theoretically coherent design framework. Required strength is determined on the basis of an estimated yield displacement and desired limits of system ductility and drift demands. A simple deterministic approach is presented along with its elaboration into a probabilistic treatment that allows for design to limit annual probabilities of failure. The design method allows the seismic force resisting system to be designed on the basis of elastic analysis results, while nonlinear analysis is used for performance verification. Detailing requirements of ACI 318 and Eurocode 8 are presented. Students will benefit from the coverage of seismology, structural dynamics, reinforced concrete, and capacity design approaches, which allows the book to be used as a foundation text in earthquake engineering.

It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 11th ACM Conference on Web Science (Websci'19), June 30 - July 3, 2019, Boston, MA, USA.This year, the conference theme is ""Synergies for the Good: The Web and Society"". We welcomedinterdisciplinary contributions, especially those that had a broad perspective on the web, includingthose that combined analyses of web data with other types of data (e.g., from surveys or interviews)to better understand user behavior (online and offline); carried out longitudinal studies; presentedsuccessful cases of interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary web research; used mixed-methodapproaches; critically reflected on the methods used; discussed responsible forms of Web Science(e.g. regarding standards, methods, generalizability of results); and/or those that reflected on thesocietal impact of web research, how the web is perceived in the media and in society, and whetherthis clashes with our self-image of Web Science. Thus, research on the interaction of society and theweb was invited, and we received submissions highlighting web implications, synergies derived, and how the web as a socio-technical system will evolve in future.WebSci'19 was a unique conference where a multitude of disciplines converged in a creative andcritical dialogue with the aim of understanding the web and its impacts. WebSci'19 welcomedparticipation from diverse fields including (but not limited to) art, anthropology, computer andinformation sciences, communication, economics, humanities, informatics, law, linguistics, philosophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. Following the tradition of earlierconferences, contributions to WebSci'19 aimed to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thecommunity engaged with novel and thought-provoking ideas and discussed original research, work in progress, analysis, and practice in the field of Web Science, its current theoretical, methodological, and epistemological challenges as well as Web practices of individuals, collectives, institutions, and platforms. This year we were very pleased to accept 41 submissions for the regular research track chosen outof 130 submissions. We are grateful for the support of the Program Committee which consisted of16 senior members and 66 regular members who selected an interesting, varied, exciting programcomprising 31 long and 10 short papers. In addition to the posters selected from the Call forPosters, eight contributions were invited to be presented as a poster because they sparked fruitfuldiscussions among the reviewers and were deemed to be of great interest and relevance to theWebSci'19 community.This year WebSci'19 encouraged authors to particularly prepare and publish reproducibilityinformation of conducted research and resources, such as source code and datasets. Authors wereasked to add (if possible) a link (e.g. DOI or URL) to data or any other information relevant to theirsubmission. With this measure WebSci'19 aimed at raising awareness of the reproducibility issueand demonstrated that, as a community-driven conference, it subscribes to and actively promotesOpen Science principles in research.

Preservation and Reuse Design for Fragile Territories’ Settlements,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011444279?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=21,"Francesco,Augelli",Springer    ,9783030454968.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4968/9783030454968.jpg,"

This book reports on an architectural conservation and reuse project in Anipemza, an Armenian Soviet-era village on the Turkish border, just a few steps away from the important Yererouyk archaeological site. Based on current tourist trends, the book suggests the development of a social system and micro-economic reactivation model to endorse the territory's numerous cultural resources and preserve the memory of the village that housed the genocide orphanages and the many other stories associated with the village. Further, the development of sustainable tourism will lead to an improved relationship between locals and visitors. Examining the development of a system of strategies able to cope with the existing social, economic and hygiene problems as well as the architectural preservation aims, the book provides valuable guidelines for the local community.

The Socio-Spatial Design of Community and Governance,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200919283?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=21,"Sam,Jacoby",Springer    ,9789811568107.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8107/9789811568107.jpg,"

This book proposes a new interdisciplinary understanding of urban design in China based on a study of the transformative effects of socio-spatial design and planning on communities and their governance. This is framed by an examination of the social projects, spaces, and realities that have shaped three contexts critical to the understanding of urban design problems in China: the histories of ""collective forms"" and ""collective spaces"", such as that of the urban danwei (work-unit), which inform current community building and planning; socio-spatial changes in urban and rural development; and disparate practices of ""spatialised governmentality"". These contexts and an attendant transformation from planning to design and from government to governance, define the current urban design challenges found in the dominant urban xiaoqu (small district) and shequ (community) development model. Examining the histories, transformations, and practices that have shaped socio-spatial epistemologies and experiences in China - including a specific sense of community and place that is rather based on a concrete ""collective"" than abstract ""public"" space and underpinned by socialised governance - this book brings together a diverse range of observations, thoughts, analyses, and projects by urban researchers and practitioners. Thereby discussing emerging interdisciplinary urban design practices in China, this book offers a valuable resource for all academics, practitioners, and stakeholders with an interest in socio-spatial design and development.

Regenerative-Adaptive Design for Sustainable Development,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200322013?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=21,"Phillip B,Ro繹s",Springer    ,9783030532338.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/2338/9783030532338.jpg,"

In this book, the author tests a regenerative-adaptive pattern language theory towards investigating the possibilities of a holistic, integrated design and planning method for sustainable development that incorporates the principles of regenerative design, as well as an adaptive pattern language that re-establishes our wholeness with nature, and considers the vulnerabilities of a changing landscape. The book examines an integral approach to contemporary theories of planning and design that explores the human-nature relationship patterns in social and spatial interconnections, between people and their natural environments. The interconnectedness of human and natural systems is used to scaffold possible solutions to address key environmental and sustainability issues that specifically address the need for patterns of behaviour that acknowledge the duality of 'man and nature'.  In 12 chapters, the book presents a holistic, regenerative-adaptive pattern language that encapsulates how communities can better appreciate landscape change under future climate effects, and acknowledges the importance to adapt to patterns of change of place and the environment and therefore inform the communities' responses for sustainable development. The application of the regenerative-adaptive pattern language was tested along the Great Ocean Road region of the Victorian coast in Australia. The concluding chapters argues that for human settlements and cities to be resilient and sustainable, we must understand the interconnected patterns of human-built environments and natural systems, and how we function in a social-spatial dimension with these. The book is intended for practitioners and academic scholars with interest in sustainable development, regenerative design, pattern languages, biophilia, settlement planning, and climate change adaptation.

The importance of optimization has been constantly increasing in today's world due to limitations in available resources and increases in human population. Engineers always strive to design efficient structural systems which must be as economical as possible yet strong enough to withstand the most demanding functional requirements arising during their service life. The traditional trial and error structural approach is very often not sufficient to achieve designs satisfying economical and safety criteria simultaneously.  This book presents efficient metaheuristic algorithms for optimal design of structures, many of which have been developed by the author and his students. They are augmented by further metaheuristics developed by other authors and have been successfully applied to various optimization problems in the field. The concepts and algorithms presented in this book are not only applicable to the optimization of skeletal structures and finite element models, but equally can be utilized for optimal design of other systems in hydraulic engineering, transportation, mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering and electrical engineering. In this present updated third edition, five new chapters have been added covering new developments in the field of optimization.

Revision with unchanged content. While a single fiber strand in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) has over a terabit-per-second bandwidth and a wavelength channel has over a gigabit-per-second transmission speed, the network may still be required to support traffic requests at rates that are lower than the full wavelength capacity. To avoid assigning an entire lightpath to a small request, many researchers have looked at adding traffic grooming to the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. In this work, we consider the RWA problem with traffic grooming (GRWA) for mesh networks under static and dynamic lightpath connection requests. The GRWA problem is NP-Complete since it is a generalization of the RWA problem which is known to be NP-Complete. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model that accurately depicts the GRWA problem. Because it is very hard to find a solution for large networks using ILP, we solve the GRWA problem by proposing two novel heuristics. The strength of the proposed heuristics stems from their simplicity, efficiency and applicability to large-scale networks. The book is addressed to professionals in optical communcation networks like professors, students and engineers.

Emotions in Technology Design: From Experience to Ethics,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200916582?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=22,"Rebekah,Rousi",Springer    ,9783030534820.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4820/9783030534820.jpg,"

Understanding emotions is becoming ever more valuable in design, both in terms of what people prefer as well as in relation to how they behave in relation to it. Approaches to conceptualising emotions in technology design, how emotions can be operationalised and how they can be measured are paramount to ascertaining the core principles of design.  Emotions in Technology Design: From Experience to Ethics provides a multi-dimensional approach to studying, designing and comprehending emotions in design. It presents emotions as understood through basic human-technology research, applied design practice, culture and aesthetics, ethical approaches to emotional design, and ethics as a cultural framework for emotions in design experience. Core elements running through the book are: cognitive science - cognitive-affective theories of emotions (i.e., Appraisal); culture - the ways in which our minds are trained to recognise, respond to and influence design; and ethics - a deep cultural framework of interpretations of good versus evil. This ethical understanding brings culture and cognition together to form genuine emotional experience.  This book is essential reading for designers, technology developers, HCI and cognitive science scholars, educators and students (at both undergraduate and graduate levels) in terms of emotional design methods and tools, systematic measurement of emotion in design experience, cultural theory underpinning how emotions operate in the production and interaction of design, and how ethics influence basic (primal) and higher level emotional reactions. The broader scope equips design practitioners, developers and scholars with that 'something more' in terms of understanding how emotional experience of technology can be positioned in relation to cultural discourse and ethics.

Science fiction is often presented as a source of utopia, or even of prophecies, used in capitalism to promote social, political and technoscientific innovations. Science Fiction and Innovation Design assesses the validity of this approach by exploring the impact this imaginary world has on the creativity of engineers and researchers. Companies seek to anticipate and predict the future through approaches such as design fiction: mobilizing representations of science fiction to create prototypes and develop scenarios relevant to organizational strategy. The conquest of Mars or the weapons of the future are examples developed by authors to demonstrate how design innovation involves continuous dialogue between multiple players, from the scientist to the manager, through to the designers and the science fiction writers.

This book is about the relation between scientific research and professional practice on the built environment. The physical form of cities is structured in different elements of urban form. Each of these elements, and the way they are combined into distinct patterns, is shaped by various agents and processes of change. Planning, urban design and architecture are practice-oriented activities that have a significant impact on these elements. Yet, this 'action' on the physical form if cities tends to be separated from scientific 'knowledge' on this complex object. In fact, none of these activities is strongly related to urban morphology, the science of urban form. There are many reasons for this gap. One of the reasons is the lack of significant examples of how the bridging process can happen. The book addresses this specific issue. It gathers a number of cases, developed in the last years in different geographical contexts - from Latin America to Eastern Asia - that exemplify how to move from scientific research to professional practice. Each case, or set of cases, is presented in one chapter. The first part of each chapter presents the morphological view of his/her author(s) on the process of city building; the second part exemplifies how this author moves from reading to design.

This book is designed primarily for use as a textbook in a one-semester course on compiler design for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. The only prerequisites for this book are familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures (lists, maps, recursion, etc.), a rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture and assembly language, and some experience with the Java programming language.A complete study of compilers could easily fill several graduate-level courses, and therefore some simplifications and compromises are necessary for a one-semester course that is accessible to undergraduate students. Following are some of the decisions made in order to accommodate the goals of this book.The book has a narrow focus as a project-oriented course on compilers. Compiler theory is kept to a minimum, but the project orientation retains the ""fun"" part of studying compilers.The source language being compiled is relatively simple, but it is powerful enough to be interesting and challenging. It has basic data types, arrays, procedures, functions, and parameters, but it relegates many other interesting language features to the project exercises.The target language is assembly language for a virtual machine with a stack-based architecture, similar to but much simpler than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This approach greatly simplifies code generation. Both an assembler and an emulator for the virtual machine are provided on the course web site.No special compiler-related tools are required or used within the book. Students require access only to a Java compiler and a text editor, but most students will want to use Java with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).One very important component of a compiler is the parser, which verifies that a source program conforms to the language syntax and produces an intermediate representation of the program that is suitable for additional analysis and code generation. There are several different approaches to parsing, but in keeping with the focus on a one-semester course, this book emphasizes only one approach, recursive descent parsing with one symbol lookahead.

""Knowledge is power"", and the power house of knowledge is the library. Technology has pervaded all spheres of human activities, including library services. An organised library is a must in institutions of learning at all levels. Thus, in this age of technology, automating library services becomes the way to go. So, using Office Technology and Management Department as case study, this work developed a computer-based one-stop-shop, library information system that is user-friendly for proper inventory of library resources. Following observations, interviews and review of existing documentation, the Structured System Analysis Design (SSADM) and Knowledge Engineering Methodologies were used for problem analysis and design. Unified Modeling Language was used for the design, with underlying database interface using CSS and HTML and a back-end PHP framework. This system would ensure improved services for libraries due to better storage and retrieval. This work should especially pique the interest of institutions of learning, software programmers, library managers, information technologists and indeed all individual book lovers who own or intend to own private libraries.

This book was written from a perspective over the past 13+ years of my experience working as a designer in both print and digital mediums across mobile, digital, web marketing, platform design, ux design, print design, brand identity design, responsive design, augmented reality design anvd environmental design for agencies, startups, global corporations, entrepreneurs, public figures, celebrities and entertainment companies. Over the course of my career, I have worked across these various areas within design utilizing design thinking, processes and execution of work in collaboration with many others in the corporate global space, startups, small businesses and non-profits. This writing serves as an exercise in thinking about design, the current landscape of design, and what might the future designer need to encompass for design to evolve and succeed amidst the changing global cultural landscape. The idea of the term ""metamodernism"" serves as a framework to observe and describe a sensibility happening within culture. The first half of this book discusses views on design and culture and the last half explores how the designer might approach the future of design related to these observations. Within these two sections, I try to describe and articulate the ideas around ""metamodernism"" and how we came to be within that movement today. It's been a long journey of success and failure within the work of design. This book is a collection of thoughts and observations collected over time through working on large and small design projects, leading teams, failing in startups, writing code, building apps, creating album art, designing brands and building platforms and campaigns for some of the biggest companies in the world. This book doesn't provide specific answers to become a great designer through practice and technique, but provokes you to think about the observations laid out to create a new place to observe, think and find new ways to apply design for the future.

Revision with unchanged content. This theses addresses the various tradeoffs involved when designing SRAM's. Each component of the SRAM is looked at in detail and various tradeoffs explored. The key to low power operation in the SRAM data path is to reduce the signal swing on the high capacitance nodes like the bitlines and the data lines. A unique resetting scheme for the row decoders has been proposed. Using this technique the word line pulse width can be minimized and the signal swings on the bitlines reduced. Finally a 4Kb prototype SRAM has been designed and verified. This design incorporates some of the circuit techniques used to reduce power dissipation and delay. Experimental data has been provided which shows the effectiveness of using the resetting scheme for the row decoders. The book is addressed to professionals and students in the semi-conductor industry and especially those in circuit design. It is also directed towards researchers in memory cell design and memory architecture design.

I have been studying, teaching about, designing, researching, analyzing, and consulting on cam follower systems for fifty years. I designed many cams at Polaroid Corporation in the 1960-1970 period then went on to teach mechanical engineering at various universities for 42 years until 2012. I usually taught courses on kinematics, dynamics, machine design, and stress analysis. Most of these courses included the design and analysis of cams. Over the years I taught, I also actively consulted for engineering companies all around the world on machine design problems, many of them involving cams. I have written six engineering textbooks. The kinematics book, Design of Machinery, has an introductory chapter on cam design and one on cam dynamics. Cam Design and Manufacturing Handbook, written late in my career, encapsulates all the art and science on cams that I have learned from study, experimentation and original research done with my graduate students, and my 50-years of experience in cam design.When I consulted with companies about cams, it was common to find that the engineers who had designed them had little idea or expertise on how to properly design a cam. This was not because they were bad engineers; they were not. I blame it on a lack of training in cam design in their engineering education. Having spent my career in the ""engineering ed biz,"" I know for a fact that most U.S. engineering curricula seldom mention cam systems to their students, let alone teach them anything useful about the subject.If cams are taught at all, they typically are included in a first course in kinematics. Many textbooks written for that course, if they have a cam chapter, it is almost always out-of-date and full of errors and misinformation. Even kinematics books written relatively recently continue to contain the same obsolete and misleading information on cam design that has been prevalent for the past 50 years. My kinematics book Design of Machinery is a notable exception; it is up-to-date.The above-described situation gave me the motivation to write this primer on cam design. I want to provide a simple, clearly written, short, and inexpensive description of how to (and how not to) design a cam, aimed at the engineer in industry that may occasionally be required to do so, but may have little or no training and experience for the task.This book is essentially a lightly abridged version of the first few chapters of my comprehensive and complete book on the subject, the Cam Design and Manufacturing Handbook. I believe that this information will serve to get an engineer to the point that he or she can design a simple cam-follower system that will work. If their career finds them needing to do more than occasional work of this sort, then they can consult my more comprehensive book and other tomes on the same subject.

Biomass to Biofuel Supply Chain Design and Planning under Uncertainty: Concepts and Quantitative Methods explores the design and optimization of biomass-to-biofuel supply chains for commercial-scale implementation of biofuel projects by considering the problems and challenges encountered in real supply chains. By offering a fresh approach and discussing a wide range of quantitative methods, the book enables researchers and practitioners to develop hybrid methods that integrate the advantages and features of two or more methods in one decision-making framework for the efficient optimization of biofuel supply chains, especially for complex supply chain models.  Combining supply chain management and modeling techniques in a single volume, the book is beneficial for graduate students who no longer need to consult subject-specific books alongside mathematical modeling textbooks. The book consists of two main parts. The first part describes the key components of biofuel supply chains, including biomass production, harvesting, collection, storage, preprocessing, conversion, transportation, and distribution. It also provides a comprehensive review of the concepts, problems, and opportunities associated with biofuel supply chains, such as types and properties of the feedstocks and fuel products, decision-making levels, sustainability concepts, uncertainty analysis and risk management, as well as integration of biomass supply chain with other supply chains. The second part focuses on modeling and optimization of biomass-to-biofuel supply chains under uncertainty, using different quantitative methods to determine optimal design.

Design of Marine Risers with Functionally Graded Materials focuses on the application and use of marine risers fabricated with functionally graded materials (FGM) in ocean environments. Chapters cover the various types of marine risers available, common problems (corrosion), their fabrication and manufacturing, and their application and use in marine risers. A functionally graded materials mould is then subsequently investigated by various structural and metallurgical examinations to assess its suitability as an alternate material in the marine environment. Several characteristics of the newly developed FGM are compared with other conventional materials to explicitly highlight the superiority of the newly developed FGM.  Further chapters focus on novel design methods, such as VIV suppression systems for risers with detailed experimental investigations carried out on cylinders and a chapter on advanced materials, including titanium and composites and their application and use in the marine environment.

This book investigates Reliability-based Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (RBMDO) theory and its application in the design of deep manned submersibles (DMSs). Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is an effective design method for large engineering systems like aircraft, warships, and satellites, which require designers and engineers from various disciplines to cooperate with each other. MDO can be used to handle the conflicts that arise between these disciplines, and focuses on the optimal design of the system as a whole. However, it can also push designs to the brink of failure. In order to keep the system balanced, Reliability-based Design (RBD) must be incorporated into MDO. Consequently, new algorithms and methods have to be developed for RBMDO theory.This book provides an essential overview of MDO, RBD, and RBMDO and subsequently introduces key algorithms and methods by means of case analyses. In closing, it introduces readers to the design of DMSs and applies RBMDO methods to the design of the manned hull and the general concept design. The book is intended for all students and researchers who are interested in system design theory, and for engineers working on large, complex engineering systems.

Fault location in distribution system is critical issue to increase the availability of power supply by reducing the time of interruption for maintenance in electric utility companies. In this thesis fault location estimator for power distribution system using artificial neural network is developed for line to ground, line to line, line to line to ground and three phase to ground faults in distribution system. To develop this estimator one of rural radial power distribution feeder in Ethiopia, Oromia, Assela substation Gumguma line feeder is used as a test feeder. This feeder is simulated using ETAP software to generate data for different fault condition, with different fault resistance and loading conditions, which is the fault phase voltage and current. It is found that artificial neural networks are one of the alternate options in fault estimator design for distribution system where sufficient distribution network data are available with narrow fault location distance range from the substation. This has benefits in assisting for maintenance plan, saving efforts in fault location finding and economical benefits by reducing interruption time.

Optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained minimization problem. The algorithm in MATLAB computes the area of concrete and steel of the sections, by minimizing the overall cost, namely, cost of concrete, steel and formwork. Trial designs of compression members are carried out using the program and the results obtained are compared with those obtained by manual calculations by using MS Excel sheets. Using the results obtained for the design, graphs are drawn to study the influence of grades of concrete and steel on the total cost of axially loaded compression members and the conclusions derived will be useful to the future designers.

The fabric is designed for a particular end use and should posses certain property such as: strength, flexibility, porosity, wears resistance, fineness and so on. This property is determined by the structure of the fabric, which is characterized by fabric setting, linear density, the fabric cover, crimp percentage, mass per unit area of the fabric and so on. The main characteristic of fabric is the density of the yarns or yarn spacing. But sometimes the yarn diameter is also taken into consideration. It is known that the fabric with the same thread density may have different spacing between the threads because of the difference of the diameter. Also, fabric with different densities of yarn may have the same space between the yarn when smaller densities are combined with greater diameter. Therefore, the relative closeness of yarns depends on the density of the thread and their diameter. In this book fabric weight calculations are used from the design point of view as they are important in determining the rate at which yarn will be consumed at the loom as well as the efficiency of the weaving.

Automatic design and optimization of CMOS Analog circuits is a technique for integrate circuit simulator with Heuristic swarm optimization algorithm for optimize circuit variables to achieve desired circuit specifications. Artificial bee colony algorithm is an evolutionary heuristic algorithm that mimics the foraging behaviour of honey bees. Objective of this work is to implement Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm in Linux open source environment using GCC compiler as optimizer and it is integrated with Ng-Spice circuit simulator for design complex CMOS analog circuits. The problem of analog circuit design has become difficult due to increased complexity of MOSFET models, process variations, temperature and supply voltage variations, and requirement of low-power architectures. Therefore, analog circuit design task needs to be automated. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of the ABC algorithm for this problem. The ABC algorithm is observed to be better in performance as compared to the PSO algorithm for the various low-power, low-voltage CMOS analog circuit design.

Why are we here? Where did it all come from--the laws of nature, the stars, the universe? Humans have been asking these questions forever, but science hasn't succeeded in providing many answers--until now. In The Grand Biocentric Design, Robert Lanza, one of Time Magazine's ""100 Most Influential People,"" is joined by theoretical physicist Matej Pavsič and astronomer Bob Berman to shed light on the big picture that has long eluded philosophers and scientists alike. This engaging, mind-stretching exposition of how the history of physics has led us to Biocentrism--the idea that life creates reality--takes readers on a step-by-step adventure into the great science breakthroughs of the past centuries, from Newton to the weirdness of quantum theory, culminating in recent revelations that will challenge everything you think you know about our role in the universe. This book offers the most complete explanation of the science behind Biocentrism to date, delving into the origins of the memorable principles introduced in previous books in this series, as well as introducing new principles that complete the theory. The authors dive deep into topics including consciousness, time, and the evidence that our observations--or even knowledge in our minds--can affect how physical objects behave.  The Grand Biocentric Design is a one-of-a-kind, groundbreaking explanation of how the universe works, and an exploration of the science behind the astounding fact that time, space, and reality itself, all ultimately depend upon us.

The demand for bigger, faster and lighter moving vehicles, such as EOT Crane, ships, trains, trucks, and buses has increased the importance of efficient structural arrangements. In principle, two approaches exist to develop efficient structures: either application of new materials or the use of new structural design. A proven and well-established solution is the use of composite materials and sandwich structures. In this way, high strength to weight ratio and minimum weight can be obtained. The sandwich structures have the potential to offer a wide range of attractive design solutions. In addition to the obtained weight reduction, these solutions can often bring space-saving.

In this book, the commercial computational fluid dynamics tool for micro-fluidics, known as Comsol multyphysics, is used to study the effect of different configuration on pressure drop as well as to study the mixing of two fluids in T and Y shape with different configurations. Micro-mixer with obstacles located on the channel wall as well as waveform configurations are used to enhance mixing in the channel, so as to reduce the mixing length. Micro channels with different geometric layout and with different shapes and sizes of obstacles such as rectangular, triangular and semicircular, are analyzed for their mixing length. The triangular obstacles within the T as well as Y channel gave minimum mixing length for the same distance between the obstacles. Also T and Y channel with 1w spacing between waveform gave minimum mixing length. A proof of experiment is carried out to show mixing of fluids from two inlets. It is observed that mixing length required for Y shape channel without obstacle is more than Y shape channel with triangular obstacles. In Y shape channel with triangular obstacles, turbulence created at tip of obstacles which increases mixing rate.

Content preparation is an integral part of the usability equation: it answers the question of what information is needed for effective decision making. Once content preparation has been established, the question how to present what can be answered. Content Preparation Guidelines for the Web and Information Appliances: Cross-Cultural Comparisons provides a theoretical foundation and operational tools to effectively prepare content so that users are able to make correct decisions regarding the purchase of goods and services. Traditionally, human aspects of computing have been assessed by usability evaluation methods, which determine how well the system is designed for joyful, satisfying, and productive use. But, effectively designing the how without providing a solid foundation for designing the what can not result in effective web and information appliance-based operations. This book presents a review and reappraisal of the science base of content preparation and descriptions of four major studies on content preparation involving more than 1,200 participants. Based on these studies, it establishes a factor structure of content preparation and relative importance of each factor in effective decision making and concludes with guidelines for the design of content for a variety of populations.Unlike previous publications in usability that have predominantly concentrated on how to present information, this book focuses on what information should be presented and the information appliances for different cultures. With a cross-cultural comparison and a review of fundamental theories, the book not only answers the question of what information needs to be presented for effective decision making, but also addresses the impact of culture on content usability.

In this book, attempts are made to design a intelligent Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID)controller for processes. A simple Genetic Algorithm(GA)method has been applied to various single-input- single-output(SISO) & Multi-Input-Multi-Output(MIMO)process models for obtaining optimum PID parameters for minimization of error performance indices. The proposed method can choose the best PID parameters for each generation. Then, using the reproduction, crossover and mutation to create the new population for other PID parameters, the optimum PID parameter are obtained.The proposed method is compared with Ho et al., Ziegler-Nichols and Wang et al. It is observed that the results using proposed method are better in terms of IAE, ISE and ITAE. A simple and effective design methodology of decentralized PID controllers is developed based on extension of the GA based SISO controllers. Initially the system is decoupled using decoupler matrix and the first-order-plus-delay-time(FOPDT) model of each subsystems is obtained. FOPDT model obtained from decoupler, retains the unit characteristics of systems. A genetic approach is applied to obtain the parameters of the Decentralized PID controller.

The armoured vehicles are designed to carry heavy loads and move along a variety of terrains. The mobility is the major factor that makes the armoured vehicle move freely and rapidly over the terrains. Currently, wheeled vehicles and tracked vehicles are used for off-road conditions.The reconfigurable wheel contains triangular configuration and circular configuration which automatically changed with respect to the speed of the vehicle. The triangular configuration will give more traction and stability while the circular configuration will provide easy mobility. In this paper, the various components required for the proposed mechanism are designed using CATIA V5 R6 and detailed stress and displacement analysis are carried out using ANSYS R18.2. The optimum design parameters are obtained and simulation of the reconfigurable wheel is performed. The reconfigurable wheel takes a triangular configuration when the speed is below 20kmph and transformed into circular configuration while the speed increases beyond 20kmph which assures stability and mobility of the armoured vehicles.

	想要打造好用、有效率、令使用者滿意的網站，就需要完善的 UX 設計！
	網站企劃、網站開發者、設計總監、製作人、設計師、工程師……
	網頁設計相關人士必讀的 UX Design 指南

	「UX」是什麼？「UX」是「User eXperience」的縮寫，翻譯為「使用者體驗」。有種說法是，「UX」並非一般所指的產品或服務等「事物」，而是包含事物在內，所謂的環境「狀態」的設計。

	舉例來說，我們以為咖啡店賣的商品（事物）是咖啡，實際上，咖啡的定價中包含了咖啡店內店員的應對、座椅的舒適性、內部裝潢、場所、顧客種類、時間……等全部（狀態）的價值。使用者絕對不是光憑咖啡本身就掏錢，而是購買坐在咖啡店裡喝咖啡的完整體驗。

	同理可知，做為網站設計者，一個網站的好壞也不是光看表面上的操作介面 (UI) 和視覺設計，還有使用者的操作感覺、使用體驗。然而，在網站做出來之前，我們要如何了解使用者的體驗、進而改善網站呢？那就是這本書要教你的事。

	本書由實際在日本大型數位行銷公司 IMJ Corporation 執行 UX 設計的作者群負責執筆，為網站製作者設計了循序漸進的 UX 設計課程。從 UX 設計基礎開始，到「易用性評估」、「製作原型」、「結構化腳本」、「使用者調查」、「顧客旅程地圖」、「塑造使用者形象」、「導入組織」等，共分成 8 章來說明。有鑑於許多企業對 UX 設計不熟悉，或是因預算問題、時程問題而導入困難，作者群皆從經手過的案例來解析，並在書中收錄了實際導入組織時可用的技巧及大小兩個專案模型案例，把現實狀況與實作方法整合在本書中，而不只是紙上談兵。另外，還提供範本下載，讓你不只是理解，也能立刻動手嘗試，是一本可以讓你體驗 UX 設計現場的絕佳參考書。

Digital image and video in their raw form require an enormous amount of storage capacity and the number of such applications is increasing day by day. Also the huge data systems also contain a lot of redundant information. As massive data transfer is taking place over communication links, compression of data to be stored or transmitted reduces storage space and transmission bandwidth as redundant information is removed. Compression also increases the capacity of the communication channel. Considering the important role played by digital imaging and video in today's world, it is necessary to develop a system that produces high degree of compression while preserving critical image or video information.

Design and Development of Helical Coil Tube in Tube Heat Exchanger,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108699484?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=26,"Pramod,Deshmukh",Ingram      ,9786139859832.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9832/9786139859832.jpg,"

In the present days Heat exchangers are the important engineering systems with wide variety of applications including power plants, nuclear reactors, refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, heat recovery systems, chemical processing and food industries. Helical coil configuration is very effective for heat exchangers and chemical reactors because they can accommodate a large heat transfer area in a small space, with high heat transfer coefficients. Conventional heat exchangers are large in size and heat transfer rate is also less and in conventional heat exchanger dead zone is produced which reduces the heat transfer rate and to create turbulence in conventional heat exchanger some external means is required and the fluid in conventional heat exchanger is not in continuous motion with each other. Tube in tube helical coil heat exchanger provides a compact shape with its geometry offering more fluid contact and eliminating the dead zone, increasing the turbulence and hence the heat transfer rate. As helical coil heat exchangers have compact size and higher heat transfer coefficient they are widely used in industrial applications such as food preservation, refrigeration, process.

Revision with unchanged content. Rapid advances in information processing, communication and sensing technologies have enabled more and more devices to be provided with embedded processors, networking capabilities and sensors. For the field of estimation and control, it is now possible to consider an architecture in which many simple components communicate and cooperate to achieve a joint team goal. This distributed architecture promises much in terms of performance, reliability and simplicity of design. However, at the same time, it requires extending the traditional theories of control, communication and computation and, in fact, looking at a unified picture of the three fields. The chief idea explored in this book is the joint design of information flow and the control law. While traditional control design has concentrated on calculating the optimal control input by assuming a particular information flow between the components, our approach seeks to synthesize the optimal information flow along with the optimal control law that satisfies the constraints of the information flow. As we demonstrate in the book, the joint design of information flow and the optimal control input satisfying the constraints of that information flow yields large improvements in performance over simply trying to fit traditional design theories on distributed systems.

This book comprises of details regarding Product Design, Product Design for Manufacturing and Assembly, Product Development Process and Product Planning, Product Analysis and Material Selection, Identifying Customer Needs, Value Engineering. Product design describes process of imagining, creating, and iterating products that solve user's problems or address specific needs in a given market. Product design process is the set of various strategic and tactical activities, from idea generation to commercialization, used to create a product design. In a systematic approach, product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas, turning them into tangible inventions and products. The key to successful product design is an understanding of the end user customer, the person for whom the product is being created. Product design focuses not only on specific products but the overall experience of the product. Value engineering is a systematic, organized approach to providing necessary functions in a project at the lowest cost. Value engineering promotes the substitution of materials and methods with less expensive alternatives, without sacrificing functionality.

EEAODV illustrates the energy conservation technique to improve the routing protocol efficiency. The energy conservation is attained in the MAC layer. It deals with the proposed energy conservation scheme. It explains the relation of routing overhead and energy conservation and it deals with the routing overhead reduction. It calculates the available and required energy of communication node and it evaluates the conserved energy level. It simulates the consuming energy in EE-AODV and, it compares the simulation result with AODV protocol. In the second fold, Energy Conserved-AODV is proposed, In EC-AODV, the source node sends a packet to the destination node. During this process, the source node sends RREQ packets to the intermediate nodes. The intermediate nodes initially in the sleeping state, awakens when the RREQ packet arrives and it forwards to the next node and again it is going to the sleep node. This protocol increases the survivability of the network by maintaining the network connectivity and to lead to a longer battery life of the terminals.

In conjunction with the rapid growth in adopting smart devices, the smart cities concept has been raised simultaneously in many modern societies. A smart grid is an essential part of any smart city as both consumers and power utility companies benefit from the features provided by the power grid. In addition to advanced features presented by smart grids, there may also be a risk when the grids are exposed to malicious acts such as security attacks performed by terrorists. Many vendors develop smart meters and at the same time, many researchers have proposed various supported security systems, however, no security measures were considered in most of those designs. This book presents a security study for smart metering systems with a prototype implementation for future works.

As manufacturing companies thrive to achieve global competitiveness, effective plant monitoring and short decision making time has proven to be a big contribution for them to achieve their goal. To cut operational costs and offer a competitive edge, the companies need not only to capture equipment failure but to predict the failure occurrence. The book discusses an analytical decision support tool for monitoring a generator thrust bearing of a hydro power station. The system consists of a distributed Multi-Agent System (MAS) comprising of agents. The diagnosis agent is responsible for obtaining the parameter readings from the sensors using a Siemens PLC and an OPC server. The decision alarm agent uses a rule base to monitor the parameters obtained from the diagnosis agent and make decisions on equipment availability. The desired action and equipment performance trends are then conveyed to the user by the distribution agent. The decision support tool is developed using the Java Agent Development framework (JADE). The proposed system showed an increase in machine availability and reduction in the maintenance scheduling time and parts inventory.

Neighborhoods in the classic sense have fallen largely out of vogue over time due to such factors as changing economies, lifestyles, and perceived associated needs. However, this has led to a stream of mutually-reinforcing negative consequences, including longer commutes to a variety of destinations, greater traffic and increased pollution, to name a few. In recent years, Sustainable Urban Development (SUD) has been considered one of the prevalent theories and policies within urban-planning literature, devoting a major portion of said literature to the subject. Tied closely to this is the idea of facilitating a resurgence of the neighborhood. The new concept of the neighborhood within SUD harkens back to some of the key facets of older neighborhoods; specifically, credence is given to the core idea that a neighborhood should meet the personal and social requirements of their respective residents. The present research is an effort towards analyzing sustainable neighborhood development aspects, in the form of a comparison between neighborhoods over time.

Microstrip coupled line is more lossy than waveguide, coaxial line and strip line because it is open lines. As the lines are close together and very narrow, it has lower power handling capability and has lower quality factor Q. After reviewing past research work, we have concluded that the DGS and fractal DGS are good choices for the miniaturization of microstrip components and enhancing the performance parameter of the same. In addition to DGS and fractal DGS, Meta materials are also good choice.

Floating point division is a core arithmetic widely used in scientific and engineering applications. This work proposed architecture for double precision floating point division. This architecture is designed for dual-mode functionality, which can either compute on a pair of double precision operands or on two pairs of single precision operands in parallel. The architecture is based on the series expansion multiplicative methodology of mantissa computation. For this, a novel dual mode Radix-4 Modified Booth multiplier is designed, which is used iteratively in the architecture of dual-mode mantissa computation. Other key components of floating point division flow (such as leading-one-detection, left/right dynamic shifters, rounding, etc.) are also re-designed for the dual-mode operation. The proposed dual- mode architecture is synthesized using UMC 90nm technology ASIC implementation. Two versions of proposed architecture are presented, one with single stage multiplier and another with two stage multiplier. Compared to a standalone double precision division architecture, the proposed dual-mode architecture requires 17% to 19% extra hardware resources, with 3% to 5% period overhead.

Geometrical Dimensioning and Tolerancing for Design, Manufacturing and Inspection: A Handbook for Geometrical Product Specification Using ISO and ASME Standards, Third Edition, presents the state of the art in geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing. It describes the international standardization in this field laid down in ISO-Standards, and also indicates how this differs from the American Standard ASME Y14.5M, in concise and clear language. The general principles of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing are described, helping to define precision-related specifications unambiguously and consistently with the constraints of the manufacturing and inspection processes. Principles for the inspection of geometrical deviations are given, together with a basis for tolerancing suitable for inspection, as well as practical examples that show correct application and offer advice beyond the scope of the standards. Since publication of the second edition of this book in 2006 more than ten ISO GPS standards have been revised, involving the introduction of new symbols and concepts, and in many cases default interpretation of the tolerance indicators have changed, in addition two new versions of American standard ASME Y14.5 (2009 and 2018) have appeared. All of these developments have been addressed in this new edition in full, together with changes to measuring equipment and technical information related to inspection methods. This book is an ideal introduction to geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing for students, and an essential reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of design, manufacturing, and inspection.

One should get as much benefit as possible from the considerable progress made in the field of control theory. Of course, not all nonlinear control methods apply to electrical AC machines, but some of them are accessible. In this respect, special focus is made on the topics of sensorless nonlinear state high gain observers, sampled output data measurements, adaptive and robust nonlinear controllers, and output feedback controllers. The most significant developments in these topics, and their practical applications to electrical system control, are described clearly in this book, as well as some new research topics. This book is intended for a wide variety of readers, including academia and industry researchers, graduate students and their professors, engineers, and practitioners. Although it includes many aspects of the theory, it is nonetheless beneficial to practitioners who will be able to use the methods without necessarily understanding every single detail of the theory. It will also be useful for new researchers in the field of AC machines control. For students, the main prerequisites are undergraduate courses on linear and nonlinear system control, on electric machines.

Since businesses grow bigger and bigger, the demand for modelling and describing a business' underlying methodology increased steadily. The powerful design of the system dynamics notation helps to define the interfering dependencies in highly dynamic systems like businesses. In order to exploit all features modern business infrastructures offer, one can enrich those models with real data from various sources. Furthermore, simulation on data and models give the opportunity to dive deeply into a system's behaviour without the constraint of existence. The goal of state-of-the-art business software is therefore to minimise the effort that has to be taken to combine static analysis and real-time event and business data in order to gain insight into existing and future business systems and facilitate decisions. The aim of this book in particular is to describe the development of a web-based system dynamics modelling tool, as well as architectural decisions that had to be taken into account from a software engineering perspective. Secondly, the applicability of such a modelling tool in not only system dynamics, but also in more generic scenarios will be discussed.

Humming, a natural query in music does not retrieve songs because the current databases functions on a text basis. The ability to retrieve a short extract of the song or the entire song thus becomes an invaluable task. The aims is to produce a path that can be used to facilitate retrieval of songs from an existing database, the specific objectives are to convert hums into a set of fundamental frequency (fo), converting fundamental frequency ( fo) to music notes and there after converts music notes into music note intervals. Finite Impulse response (FIR), a major type of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) was implemented for filtering out perturbation found in the fundamental frequencies. A set of algorithms was computed using Java software to generate modal frequencies of music notes and music note intervals. Comparing the music note intervals of the hummed query with the music note intervals of songs from an existing database, gives the desired retrieval of hymns.

Rational Design of Nanostructured Polymer Electrolytes and Solid-Liquid Interphases for Lithium Batteries,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011490822?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=28,"Snehashis,Choudhury",Springer    ,9783030289454.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9454/9783030289454.jpg,"

This thesis makes significant advances in the design of electrolytes and interfaces in electrochemical cells that utilize reactive metals as anodes. Such cells are of contemporary interest because they offer substantially higher charge storage capacity than state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. Batteries based on metallic anodes are currently considered impractical and unsafe because recharge of the anode causes physical and chemical instabilities that produce dendritic deposition of the metal leading to catastrophic failure via thermal runaway. This thesis utilizes a combination of chemical synthesis, physical & electrochemical analysis, and materials theory to investigate structure, ion transport properties, and electrochemical behaviors of hybrid electrolytes and interfacial phases designed to prevent such instabilities. In particular, it demonstrates that relatively low-modulus electrolytes composed of cross-linked networks of polymer-grafted nanoparticles stabilize electrodeposition of reactive metals by multiple processes, including screening electrode electrolyte interactions at electrochemical interfaces and by regulating ion transport in tortuous nanopores. This discovery is significant because it overturns a longstanding perception in the field of nanoparticle-polymer hybrid electrolytes that only solid electrolytes with mechanical modulus higher than that of the metal electrode are able to stabilize electrodeposition of reactive metals.

This report outlines systematic design of a solar water heating system for use in the Hotel, Catering and Institutional Management (H.C.I.M) Department of the Bolgatanga Polytechnic in the Upper East Region of Ghana and presents the results of calculations of the design parameters. A solar water heating system for domestic use has been designed and constructed using locally available materials. Solar energy is received by a flat-plate collector consisting of a thin absorber plate, integrated with underneath grids of fluid carrying tubes, and placed in an insulated casing with a transparent glass cover having a cold and a hot water tank integrated in the system. The radiation emitted by the sun is absorbed by the absorber plate and contained within it thereby increasing the temperature of the water in the tubes. The water gets heated and flows into a storage tank by the principle of thermosyphon system. A total amount of 50 liters of hot water was obtained representing 75 percent of hot water needs in the department. Maximum fluid output temperature of 80 oC, the collector temperature of 55 oC, ambient temperature of 37 簞C, and solar radiation of 4.61 KWh/m2/day, were obtained

This report outlines systematic design of a solar operated blender for use in three communities (Yorogo, Yipaala and Vea) in the Bolgatanga municipality of Ghana that has no electricity and presents the results of calculations of the design parameters as well as the final design of the solar operated blender. The base of the blender is the housing which contains the D.C motor as well as the switch. The individual components of the blender are assembled together and then connected to the solar panel. When the sun rays fall on the solar module it produces a direct current which causes the D.C motor to operate thereby turning the blade of the blender, for the blender to work. The hourly variations of the temperature in these communities is between 11.00 and 15.00 hours local time and this was considered as a good sun hours for the blender since the blender has the ability to grind about 5 grams of tomatoes and other ingredients reasonably and rapidly for almost 2 hours in a day.

Rising applications like wireless communications persist to challenge microwave or RF filters with increasingly further rigorous requirements. The latest development in new materials and fabrication technologies such as monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) and micromachining technology, have stimulated the rapid development of new microstrip filters for microwave and RF applications. The manuscript presented here is a novel H- Shape microstrip filter for multi-band applications. We represent five microstrip filters each having H -Shape but the substrate material is changed in each design. On the basis of proposed design we investigate the effect of different material on Insertion loss, reflection coefficient, VSWR and Q factor. In this paper we chose two range of material one with lower dielectric constant and other range with higher dielectric constant like FR4, Gallium Arsenide, Rogers RO3010, RT Duroid 5880 and Rogers TMM 10i. The proposed microstrip filters are developed on different substrates of thickness 1.6 mm and investigated on the frequency range of 2 GHz to 8 GHz.

Parkinson gear tester is used to test the error in the gear. Here the carriage has two spindle. One main gear is fixed in one spindle and another testing gear is fixed in the second spindle. They can slide both side and these gears are mounted in mesh by spring pressure. When the gear are rotated, the moment of sliding carriage can be measured by the dial indicator. This values are recorded in the recorder. The spindles can be adjusted so that axial distance is equal and scale is attached to one side and vernier to the other side for measure the centre distance. If errors occur in the tooth form moment of carriage due to the error in the pitch and tooth thickness. This moment is indicated in the dial gauge. The maximum gear diameter 150 mm can be tested.

Direct-conversion receivers are becoming more and more popular in wireless communication systems because they promise superior performance in power consumption, size, and cost over existing heterodyne-based receivers. Theoretically, direct-conversion receivers offer the advantage of omitting the intermediate stage required in heterodyne architectures, thereby greatly reducing the hardware complexity of receiver design. In this research, a higher order filtering technique is proposed to attenuate out-of-band blockers in a direct-conversion receiver without deteriorating the desired signal present in the band of interest. The proposed filter structure is based on a current-mode biquadratic pipe filter cell, which originally allows the implementation of only all-pole filter functions such as Butterworth. With the aim to achieve a flat magnitude response in pass-band and steep rate of attenuation in transition-band, the base structure is modified to implement higher order Inverse-Chebyshev transfer function, which requires realization of arbitrary complex zeros in the stopband. A third order prototype has been realized in a 0.18μm CMOS process using 1.8V supply voltage.

Research and development (R&D) is a process intended to create new or improved technology that can provide a competitive advantage at the business, industry, or national level. While the rewards can be very high, the process of technological innovation (of which R&D is the first phase) is complex and risky. The majority of R&D projects fail to provide the expected financial results, and the successful projects (25 to 50 percent) must also pay for the projects that are unsuccessful or terminated early by management. In addition, the originator of R&D cannot appropriate all the benefits of its innovations and must share them with customers, the public, and even competitors. For these reasons, a company's R&D efforts must be carefully organized, controlled, evaluated, and managed.The creativity of the engineers is encouraged by the management. It is considered as the starting point for technological breakthroughs for new products and applications.The objective of academic and institutional R&D is to obtain new knowledge, which may or may not be applied to practical uses. In contrast, the objective of industrial R&D is to obtain new knowledge, applicable to the company's business needs

Building tall in wood is not a new phenomenon. In fact, Canada has a history of constructing tall wood buildings out of heavy timber and brick elements, reaching up to nine storeys. In the early 20th century, with the increase in reinforced concrete and structural steel research and construction, and with growing concerns over fire and durability, the structural use of wood fell out of common use in tall buildings. This trend is beginning to reverse, however. In the last few decades, the world has seen a resurgence of mass timber products and systems that are paving the way for tall wood buildings. This triggered an initiative by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) to support tall wood building demonstration projects to enhance Canada's position as a global leader in wood building construction, by showcasing the application and performance of advanced wood technologies. The Technical Guide for the Design and Construction of Tall Wood Buildings in Canada has been prepared to assist architects, engineers, code consultants, developers, building owners, and Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) in understanding the unique issues to be addressed when developing and constructing tall wood buildings.

Demand for energy is growing day by day in the world. Due to limited resources and continuously growing demand there is an urgent need to utilize our finite resources carefully for a sustainable future. Our common goal is to achieve this task in the most efficient, cost effective, and least polluting manner. The energy available in the exhaust of many energy conversion devices goes as waste, if not utilized properly. Since exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine (ICE) carries away -about 30% of the heat of combustion, it represents a great potential to recover the conserve energy. In this project an energy conservation technology ""waste heat recovery"" is used. In this experimental work a waste heat operated counter flow type heat exchanger is developed to utilize the waste heat from the engine exhaust for heating. After developing the heat exchanger, experimental investigation is carried out for effectiveness of heat exchanger, effect on exhaust emissions and performance of the engine when heat exchanger is integrated with engine.

Data security and network security is a crucial domain of research and development. On the other hand the computing changes their face and at the same ways the attackers and intruders are also aware about the traditional security techniques. Thus new kind of security is required to find that are not accurately from the traditional backgrounds. But the traditional cryptographic models are computationally cost effective, produce additional storage overheads, and also generate the less secure cipher for storage. Therefore in order to resolve the issues in cryptographic security a new methodology is required to develop. We have successfully implemented this hybrid approach in .NET environment. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our technique and ensure security by means of authentication, confidentiality and integrity. Additionally to make obvious performance of anticipated technique the comparative performance study with the traditional RSA algorithm is performed. Results illustrate the effectiveness of this anticipated technique with respect to traditional RSA algorithm.

Beside their energy-absorption capability, their volume and weight are also important issues, since higher volume and weight increase the injury risk for the user's head and neck. Every year many workers are killed or seriously injured in the construction industry as a result of head injuries. Wearing an appropriate safety helmet significantly reduces the risk of injury or even death. Protective headwear could save your life. At present strength of the helmet using industry is less due to improper filling of material, uneven pressure distribution and blow holes.

There is an estimation that about 70 million people in the world are mute peoples. There is no proper statistics on the number of mute peoples as Census of India doesn't reveal any official releases on the numbers. They use sign language to communicate. Sign language is the language used by mute people and it is a skill that uses gestures instead of sound to communicate with other people. But it is difficult to communicate with people who don't understand sign language.Research and projects have been done to overcome their disability but it has been very expensive. Hence to provide assistance to these people we are making a device that could speak the words based on the gesture made by the mute people so that everyone can understand.This device is controlled by PIC16F877A Microcontroller that gets input from the flex sensor that is fitted in the gloves. The gloves is worn by the people who needs to communicate with other people through gestures resulting in voice output through APR33A3 circuit. The program is fed to the controller through MPLab software.

This work demonstrates the feasibility of using gallium nitride (GaN) technology in reconfigurable RF systems. GaN-based varactor diodes and switch circuits are pursued as promising candidates for high-power/high-frequency applications. The first part is devoted to active GaN device development. Active components were realized using the Canadian National Research Council (NRC) GaN HEMTs process. Based on three process, such as, GaN150v0 (gate length of 0.15um), GaN500v1 and GaN500v2 (both with gate length of 0.5um), many varactor diodes with size different have been manufactured and characterized via DC and RF smallsignal and large-signal measurements. Then, the varactor diodes were modeled by analytic equations containing empirical coefficients. These expressions have been introduced for the first time for the voltage dependency of equivalent capacitance (CEq) and series resistance (REq) and can be used as a general model to represent the nonlinear behavior of GaN based varactors. For small-signal operation, all of the developed equations describing REq and CEq are only bias voltage and device geometry dependent.

Pedestrians are neglected because they make no noise. They go quietly findings their ways into prevailing chaos. At the city level, each and every resident is a pedestrian, but treated as a neglected road user. A recent study conducted in Indian Cities states that more than 20% of the road accidents involve pedestrian. Hence safety of pedestrian is a basic step to create safer city. A report entitled ""Road Safety in India: Challenges and Opportunities"" March 2009 states that road traffic fatalities have been increasing at about 8% annually for the last ten years. About 60% of all fatalities in urban areas belong to pedestrians. Hence pedestrian safety is a challenge for transport planners, traffic engineers, town planners, urban local bodies and policy makers to make the city safer.

Now a days electricity is most needed facility for the human being. All the conventional energy resources are depleting day by day. So we have to shift from conventional to non-conventional energy resources. In this the combination of two energy resources is takes place i.e. wind and solar energy. This process reviles the sustainable energy resources without damaging the nature. We can give uninter- rupted power by using hybrid energy system. Basically this system involves the integration of two energy system that will give continuous power. Solar panels are used for converting solar energy and wind turbines are used for converting wind energy into electricity. This electrical power can utilize for various purpose. Generation of electricity will be takes place at affordable cost. This project deals with the generation of electricity by using two sources combine which leads to generate electricity with affordable cost without damaging the nature balance.

Ginnery is a small factory in which raw cotton is processed from bowled shaped seed cotton stage to lint cotton stage. Drawback in the existing method of production activities reveals that the complete process needs improvement. It is found that no scientific method is used in most of the working stations, manual handling of materials & the workers have to walk long distances of 3 - 8 km in a shift. The methodology suggests redesigning of manual material handlings so that workers are not required to walk long distances with load as propose systems become more productive at less cost. The scope is restricted to choice of device for mechanically deciding it's major specifications & deciding the complete plan layout. A complete thought is given as regards how to mechanize all manual handling operations by implementing conveyors system through human energy calculations and manual material handlings design data bases of NIOSH. It can be fulfill the need of manual handling. Conveyor transportation system exists in various layouts depending on the purpose served.

The performance of an industrial system has great significance in recent years due to competitive environment and overall operating and production costs. When the performance of a large complex system or process plant such as chemical, paper, textile, thermal, paint, fertilizer, dairy, sugar etc. plant is low, efforts are needed to improve the performance by reducing the failure rate or increasing the repair rate for each component or subsystem of the system. The performance of an industrial system or process plant can be quantified in terms of the reliability or availability if the operating system is modeled mathematically and analyzed in real working conditions. The reliability and availability analysis has helped to identify the critical subsystems or components of the system that need more attention for improvement.

A series of second generation of on-chip optical communication links of 50繕m length, utilizing 650 - 850 nm propagation wavelengths, have been designed and realized, with a SiGe radio frequency (RF) 0.35繕m bipolar process. Micron dimensioned optical sources, silicon nitride waveguides and detectors were all integrated on the same chip to form a complete communication on-chip micro-optical links. Avalanche based Si LEDs (Si Av LEDs), Schottky contacting, TEOS densification strategies, silicon nitride based waveguides, and state of the art SiGe bipolar detector technologies were used as key design strategies. From the measurement, best performances of the designed on-chip optical links show optical edge-coupling from source to detector with -30dB total optical link budget loss up to 500MHz in cut off frequency. We observed that the good alignment of the waveguide with the source and the good efficiency of each integrated device are then clearly achieved. Higher frequency performances are also envisaged from preliminary measurements.

OpenSPARC T1 is the first open-source, multi-threaded and multi-cored processor developed by SUN micro-systems. The objective of this book is to carry out an ASIC design of the core of this processor using the 130nm CMOS technology. Starting from the open-source RTL description of the OpenSPARC T1 processor core, several modifications like memory mapping, reducing the processor threads and suppressing the test pins were made in order to reduce the processor size to fir it into a 4 x 4 mm2 die area as required by the technology supplier. The correct functionality of the modified RTL description of this processor was verified against over 500 test scripts given by SUN Inc. Next, to convert the design from the RTL form to its gate level equivalent the design was synthesized. Subsequently, the design was physically implemented using the Place and Route flow, including the normal steps like floorplanning, placement, optimization, clock tree synthesis (CTS) and routing. Finally, the design was verified by a series of verification and performance evaluation tests to guarantee its functionality and performance.

Broadband wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular due to their fast and inexpensive deployment and their capabilities of providing flexible and ubiquitous Internet access. While the majority of existing broadband wireless networks are still exclusively limited to single hop access, it is the ability of these networks to forward data frames over multi-hop wireless routes which enabled them to easily extend the network coverage area. Unfortunately, achieving good multihop throughput has been challenging due to several factors, such as lossy wireless links caused by interference from concurrent transmissions, and intra-path interference caused by transmissions on successive hops along a single path. In this work, we focus on the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX mesh multi-hop and multi-channel. To maximize the network performance of mesh networks (e.g., throughput), it is essential to consider a cross-layer design, exploiting the dependency between protocol layers such as the routing network layer and the scheduling resource allocation MAC layer. Therefore this book considers a cross-layer design approach for designing efficient wireless mesh multi-hop networks.

This book helps you to understand the basic concept of power system stabilizer and its design in a wide-area control power system. Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS) serves as a platform by integrating the communication network with power system networks to transmit these remote signals. Along with its advantages communication networks within WAMS adds some unavoidable constraints like delay and packet losses to the transmitted data which may affect the stabilizer performance negatively. To enhance the system capability considering those losses, an attempt has been made to solve those problems via controlling strategies.

This work contains a general introduction to cryptography science with a focus on block and stream ciphers. We describe their most famous structures and the building blocks that can be involved. Moreover, we study the relationship between the chaotic theory and the cryptography system. Furthermore, we present the most general type of cryptanalysis techniques. We evaluate several cryptosystems in the context of multimedia data which shows the weaknesses of standards encryption algorithm named Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This work contributes to the field of cryptanalysis by examining block and stream schemes. Moreover, it contributes in the field also of cryptography by designing new cryptosystems dedicated to multimedia data especially images by adopting a new structure named outer-inner structure. The later mixes the advantage of a classic and chaos-based cipher. This cipher is designed in a way to achieve high diffusion and confusion properties and to make the differential and linear cryptanalysis unfeasible. Moreover, in this work, we present a new cipher adoptable for real-time applications based on a chaos system.

This book helps the researchers and industrialists working on power electronic converters for renewable source integration. To design a hybrid renewable energy source (RES) system, different power electronic converter (PEC) topologies are discussed and highlighted in this book. Among all, non-isolated multi input DC-DC power converters are extensively utilized for its simple structure and it does not require a high frequency transformer. In this book, different power electronic converters are integrated together by sharing and merging power converter components between the DC-DC converters to develop a hybrid power converter. A hybrid system necessitates an individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control algorithm to track the maximum power point (MPP) from the high penetration of RES. As the number of control algorithms increases, this can escalate the system intricacy and its implementation. To overcome these flaws, a single MPPT control algorithms are discussed and highlighted in this book for extracting MPP concurrently. By going through this book one can easily understand the hybrid renewable energy system and role of power electronics in renewable energy system.

Embedded Real-Time Operating Systems Design: Insights and Implementation combines explanations of RTOS concepts with detailed, practical implementation guidance for designing a basic real-time kernel--limited in scope and simple to understand--that could be used for a real design of modest complexity. The kernel features upward-compatibility to a commercial real-time operating system: Nucleus RTOS. Code is provided which can be used without restriction, along with practical information on scheduling, preemption and interrupt information flow (queues, semaphores) and how they work, and signaling between tasks (signals, events).  Also includes coverage of memory management (Where does each task get its stack from? What happens if the stack is overflowed? Reallocation or Fault?), CPU contexts (storage and retrieval after a context switch), and more. The book teaches readers how to utilize a basic real-time kernel to develop their own prototype, how to design RTOS features, and how to understand the facilities of a commercial RTOS.

Current buildings (in Europe) constitute roughly for 40% of the energy usage out of the total energy used. This level can be dropped to 10-20% if smarter and greener buildings are incorporated around the world. Buildings can be made smart by using dynamic movement (rotation), sensors and greener by deploying solar energy to conserve power. In this research, different innovative solar tracking techniques will be deployed on different structures (non-rotating and rotating). By means of simulation (LabVIEW) and by comparing results we will be able to define the most suitable framework of solar deployment and will be able to define whether a dynamic building is more worthy than a stationary one in terms of cost and conservation of energy. The following research introduces topics like rotating buildings, different techniques of tracking the sun and rise of concern in the world about greener and smarter buildings. Through my research, I would like to initiate a movement in the direction of innovative, greener and smarter buildings. As the world, doesn't realize that wasting power needlessly will come back to haunt us severely in the next few coming years. -M.Rehan-

In the last 15-20 years, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has emerged as one of the most popular and intrinsically simple techniques for depositing a wide range of the most exciting materials being explored for next generation applications. Such sustained popularity is due to the inherent versatility, flexibility, and speed of a process that can be applied to essentially any material, from simple metals, through binary compounds, to multi-component high-quality single crystals. Pulsed laser deposition had several characteristics that made it remarkably competitive in the complex thin-film research arena as compared to other film growth techniques. These principle attractive features were stoichiometric transfer, and simplicity in initial setup and in the investigation of arbitratry compounds. One could rapidly investigate thin-film deposition of nearly any compound regardless of the complexity of the crystal chemistry.

Assessment on the Impacts of Geometric Design on Road Safety,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c011455156?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=32,"Alamirew Mulugeta,Tola",LAP Lambert Academic Publishing,9783330048140.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8140/9783330048140.jpg,"

Road transport plays a vigorous role in the life of an individual socioeconomically. In order to have a normal traffic flow, road engineers must have to give priority to safety in their design such as consistent geometric design. In addition to driver error, roadway factors and the combined driver error and inconsistent geometric design are the major contributors to road safety issue. For a long period of time, road safety analysis was carried out with a traditional technique of sliding scale analysis. Which have drawbacks of incapability of using the latest technologies and also, tedious and unclear data acquisition and analysis. But, in this book the latest technique of using Geographical Information System (GIS) have been adopted for road safety analysis. Basically, the application of ArcGIS software has been implemented for the detection of crash intensive prone locations and identification of inconsistent geometric design segment of the road. In this book, Crash Hot-Spot locations and inconsistent geometric design segments of the road had been merged together to analyze the impacts of geometric design on road safety.

The broadband wireless communications extensively use high-performance synthesizers. To achieve flexible frequency synthesis, the two essential components namely Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) followed by the frequency divider must be power efficient and operate at high frequency. The frequency divider is a basic block in a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) synthesizer for the conversion from high to low frequencies. Prescaler is one of the most vital parts of frequency-divider as it works at high speed and consumes maximum power. The objective of this research work is to design divide by 'N' prescaler and divide by N/N+1 dual modulus prescalers for various low power applications. In this thesis, we have carried a detailed analysis on the speed and power consumption of the digital dividers. We performed design and implementation of low power divide by 'N' prescalers. Architecture of the divide by 'N' prescalers using hybrid master slave flip flop has been explained. Based on this architecture divide by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 prescaler circuits have been successfully designed at 5 GHz operating frequency.

The control of the performances of interconnected power system is a challenging problem at present due to the lack of damping torque which increases the oscillation of the performances such as speed deviation, rotor angle deviation and terminal voltage deviation. Robust Integral Linear Quadratic Gaussian (ILQG) controller has been designed in this book to damp the oscillation of the power system. The ILQG controller has high gain and phase margin and bandwidth. It improves the dynamic stability of the power system. The controller is designed based on a comparative performance analysis between Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller to find out the optimum control algorithm for single machine infinite bus.

The purpose of blasting is to fragment rock to aid in its removal as overburden, or to fragment the rock to a size wherby it can be fed into a crusher as the primary stage of a beneficiation process. although blasting is a relatively cheap way of loosening or breaking rock, nevertheless, the mining world is interested in still further reducing the costs of blasting, or alternatively designing ways of making the use of explosives more effective. Work was carried out on blocks of sandstone using mining explosives with electric detonator and a pressure transducer to match powder factors, blast-hole geometry. strength and velocity of blast shock-waves against fragmentation and blastability index. Useful correlations were established.

The majority of the Kenyan population resides in the rural areas and is characterized by low income and food insecurity leading to high levels of poverty. Poultry production and in particular indigenous chicken (IC) production play a significant role in the economic and social life of these resource-poor households, contributing to cheap source of animal proteins and cash income. Indigenous chickens are present whenever there are human settlements and their economic strength lies in their low cost of production which is a characteristic of the resource-poor rural households. Two of the major challenges facing layer chicken farmers are; the high cost of electric energy used for lighting/heating poultry houses, heating incubators and the cost of supplying sufficient water to the poultry farm. By providing an alternative cheaper source of electricity for the farmers, this inherent costs will be eliminated or reduced hence boosting profits and enhancing growth. This research proposes designing a Hybrid solar and wind electricity generation system to either supplement or replace the electric power from the national grid of a chicken farm.

Heat treating is the controlled heating and cooling of a material to achieve certain mechanical properties, such as hardness, strength and the reduction of residual stresses. Many heat treating processes require the precise control of temperature over the heating cycle.Typically, the energy used for process heating accounts for 2% to 15% of the total production cost. The objective of this work is to develop a comprehensive furnace model by improving the current coal fired furnace to an electrical element fired furnace.This study is mainly concerned with the continuous improvement in all work areas from high level strategic planning and decision making to detailed execution of work elements on the shop floor particularly at the coal fired pre-heating furnace at the machine shop. I believe that the cost of production can be reduced to minimal which can improve the company's profit margin. This will also lead to continuous improvement of results in all work areas and as a result continuously improving capabilities, people, processes, technology and machine capabilities.

Furthermore, our work describes the details on the protocol in the workflow, data structure and quantitative algorithm, context decision and reasoning algorithm and so on. It is also proposed in the work, a low complexity cryptographic algorithm for IoT and its attack detection analysis. Finally, the simulation is given to analyze the work performance of the protocol CRP. Theoretical analysis and experiment verify that CRP has higher energy efficiency and a longer lifetime than the congeneric protocols.

Ecology, like all literary narrative, has the potential for turnabout, surprise, lessons learned, and tragedy. The stories in Threads from the Web of Life and The Shark and the Jellyfish describe protagonists, their competitors, and the habitats that provide the setting for their interaction--habitats that have become surprisingly complex with the passage of evolutionary time.  One niche moves across a world of flowers that reaches its earliest peak bloom in the low valleys and then peaks later among the slopes of the foothills--a rolling habitat. Another hop-scotches across the ocean floor, compelling its occupants to migrate from the fallen body of one dead whale to the next. Yet another appears in the aftermath of typhoons, requiring its inhabitants to search the tropical coastline for the latest storm landfall.  These tales are filled with no less intrigue than other literary works, but they transpire out of the sight of most readers. Once known only to ecologists, in Threads from the Web of Life and The Shark and the Jellyfish, available for the first time in a single deluxe paperback, these stories become accessible to everyone with an interest in natural history.

The text is intended to be used in either a junior or senior engineering design course with an integrated hands-on design project. The whole text is used in the senior capstone design course that includes a complete design project, starting from selecting a market to creating a working prototype.What is design? If you search the literature for an answer to that question, you will find about as many definitions as there are designs. Perhaps the reason is that the process of design is such a common human experience. Webster's dictionary says that to design is ""to fashion after a plan,"" but that leaves out the essential fact that to design is to create something that has never been. Certainly an engineering designer practices design by that definition, but so does an artist, a sculptor, a composer, a playwright, or any another creative member of our society.Thus, although engineers are not the only people who design things, it is true that the professional practice of engineering is largely concerned with design; it is often said that design is the essence of engineering.The expanded boundaries and responsibilities of engineering create almost unlimited opportunities for you.

This book facilitates the VLSI interested people not only with the in-depth knowledge but the broad aspects of it by explaining its applications in different fields e.g. image processing and biomedical. The deep understanding of basic concepts gives you the power to develop a new application aspect, which is very well taken care of in this book by using simple language in explaining the concepts. In the VLSI world, the importance of hardware description languages cannot be ignored as the designing of such dense and complex circuits is not possible without them. Both Verilog and VHDL languages are used here for designing. The current needs of high performance integrated circuits including low power devices and new emerging materials which can play a very important role in achieving new functionalities, are the most interesting part of the book. The testing of VLSI circuits becomes more crucial than the designing of the circuits in this nanometer technology era. The role of fault simulation algorithms is very well explained and its implementation using Verilog is the key aspect of this book.  This book is well organized in 20 chapters. Chapter 1 emphasizes on uses of FPGA on various image processing and biomedical applications. Then the descriptions enlighten the basic understanding of digital design from the perspective of HDL in Chapters 2 to 5. The performance enhancement with alternate material or geometry for silicon-based FET designs are focused in chapter 6 and 7. Chapter 8 and 9 describes the study of bimolecular interactions with Bio-sensing FETs. Chapter 10 to 13 deals with advanced FET structures available in various shapes, materials such as nanowire, HFET etc. and their comparison in terms of device performance metrics calculation. Chapter 14 to 18 describes different application-specific VLSI design techniques and challenges for analog and digital circuit design. Chapter 19 explains the VLSI testability issues with the description of simulation and its categorization into logic and fault simulation for test pattern generation using Verilog HDL. Chapter 20 deals with a secured VLSI design with hardware obfuscation by hiding the IC's structure and function which makes it much more difficult to reverse engineer by the adversaries.

This book offers an update on recent developments in modern engineering design. Different engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, materials, computer and process engineering, provide the foundation for the design and development of improved structures, materials and processes. The modern design cycle is characterized by the interaction between various disciplines and a strong shift to computer-based approaches where only a few experiments are conducted for verification purposes. A major driver for this development is the increased demand for cost reduction, which is also linked to environmental demands. In the transportation industry (e.g. automotive or aerospace), the demand for higher fuel efficiency is related to reduced operational costs and less environmental damage. One way to fulfil such requirements is lighter structures and/or improved processes for energy conversion. Another emerging area is the interaction of classical engineering with the health and medical sector.

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.

Mems: Field Models and Optimal Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200321609?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=33,"Paolo,Di Barba",Springer    ,9783030214982.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4982/9783030214982.jpg,"

This book highlights numerical models as powerful tools for the optimal design of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Most MEMS experts have a background in electronics, where circuit models or behavioral models (i.e. lumped-parameter models) of devices are preferred to field models. This is certainly convenient in terms of preliminary design, e.g. in the prototyping stage. However, design optimization should also take into account fine-sizing effects on device behavior and therefore be based on distributed-parameter models, such as finite-element models. The book shows how the combination of automated optimal design and field-based models can produce powerful design toolboxes for MEMS. It especially focuses on illustrating theoretical concepts with practical examples, fostering comprehension through a problem-solving approach. By comparing the results obtained using different methods, readers will learn to identify their respective strengths and weaknesses. In addition, special emphasis is given to evolutionary computing and nature-inspired optimization strategies, the effectiveness of which has already been amply demonstrated. Given its scope, the book provides PhD students, researchers and professionals in the area of computer-aided analysis with a comprehensive, yet concise and practice-oriented guide to MEMS design and optimization. To benefit most from the book, readers should have a basic grasp of electromagnetism, vector analysis and numerical methods.

This book introduces a cross-layer design to achieve security and resilience for CPSs (Cyber-Physical Systems). The authors interconnect various technical tools and methods to capture the different properties between cyber and physical layers. Part II of this book bridges the gap between cryptography and control-theoretic tools. It develops a bespoke crypto-control framework to address security and resiliency in control and estimation problems where the outsourcing of computations is possible. Part III of this book bridges the gap between game theory and control theory and develops interdependent impact-aware security defense strategies and cyber-aware resilient control strategies.With the rapid development of smart cities, there is a growing need to integrate the physical systems, ranging from large-scale infrastructures to small embedded systems, with networked communications. The integration of the physical and cyber systems forms Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), enabling the use of digital information and control technologies to improve the monitoring, operation, and planning of the systems. Despite these advantages, they are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, which aim to damage the physical layer through the cyber network.This book also uses case studies from autonomous systems, communication-based train control systems, cyber manufacturing, and robotic systems to illustrate the proposed methodologies. These case studies aim to motivate readers to adopt a cross-layer system perspective toward security and resilience issues of large and complex systems and develop domain-specific solutions to address CPS challenges.A comprehensive suite of solutions to a broad range of technical challenges in secure and resilient control systems are described in this book (many of the findings in this book are useful to anyone working in cybersecurity). Researchers, professors, and advanced-level students working in computer science and engineering will find this book useful as a reference or secondary text. Industry professionals and military workers interested in cybersecurity will also want to purchase this book.

To deal with the flexible architectures and evolving functionalities of complex modern systems, the agent metaphor and agent-based computing are often the most appropriate software design approach. As a result, a broad range of special-purpose design processes has been developed in the last several years to tackle the challenges of these specific application domains. In this context, in early 2012 the IEEE-FIPA Design Process Documentation Template SC0097B was defined, which facilitates the representation of design processes and method fragments through the use of standardized templates, thus supporting the creation of easily sharable repositories and facilitating the composition of new design processes.Following this standardization approach, this book gathers the documentations of some of the best-known agent-oriented design processes. After an introductory section, describing the goal of the book and the existing IEEE FIPA standard for design process documentation, thirteen processes (including the widely known Open UP, the de facto standard in object-oriented software engineering) are documented by their original creators or other well-known scientists working in the field. As a result, this is the first work to adopt a standard, unified descriptive approach for documenting different processes, making it much easier to study the individual processes, to rigorously compare them, and to apply them in industrial projects.While there are a few books on the market describing the individual agent-oriented design processes, none of them presents all the processes, let alone in the same format. With this handbook, for the first time, researchers as well as professional software developers looking for an overview as well as for detailed and standardized descriptions of design processes will find a comprehensive presentation of the most important agent-oriented design processes, which will be an invaluable resource when developing solutions in various application areas.

In the present book, we have tried to first consider the concepts of sustainable energy, especially energy from solar cells, and then try to use these concepts to design an artistic arena for displaying and using these energies in a cultural complex. So, first we defined definitions and then presented selective samples as a model for design. To find ways and means to design that was exhausted from these examples and studies. The studies were carried out more thoroughly through library studies, and finally, using these methods, we designed a curated library to meet the goals. We outline the drawings and illustrations needed to be introduced by using the Auto-CAD and Max software.

Design of Experiments: A Modern Approach introduces readers to planning and conducting experiments, analyzing the resulting data, and obtaining valid and objective conclusions. This innovative textbook uses design optimization as its design construction approach, focusing on practical experiments in engineering, science, and business rather than orthogonal designs and extensive analysis. Requiring only first-course knowledge of statistics and familiarity with matrix algebra, student-friendly chapters cover the design process for a range of various types of experiments. The text follows a traditional outline for a design of experiments course, beginning with an introduction to the topic, historical notes, a review of fundamental statistics concepts, and a systematic process for designing and conducting experiments. Subsequent chapters cover simple comparative experiments, variance analysis, two-factor factorial experiments, randomized complete block design, response surface methodology, designs for nonlinear models, and more. Readers gain a solid understanding of the role of experimentation in technology commercialization and product realization activities--including new product design, manufacturing process development, and process improvement--as well as many applications of designed experiments in other areas such as marketing, service operations, e-commerce, and general business operations.

An observational study is an empiric investigation of effects caused by treatments when randomized experimentation is unethical or infeasible. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies.  Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum's Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R. In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher's striking advice for observational studies, ""make your theories elaborate.""  The second edition of his book, Observational Studies, was published by Springer in 2002.

The use of computers in cartography has made it a lot easier for map makers to transform data from one map projection to another and experiment with alternative representations of geographical data. Yet this has also created new challenges and opportunities for map projection scientists. Small Scale Map Projection Design focuses on numerical map projection research, and is written from the perspective of the map projection user. It demonstrates how advances in the measurement of map projection distortion and in the development of low error map projections can help map makers decide what type of map projection is best for their purpose, and shows how they can eventually design their own tailor-made map projections.A number of significant contributions have been made to the subject over recent decades, and these are reviewed along with a substantial amount of original, unpublished material. This theoretical material is tied to practical applications and issues such as map projection use, optimization and selection, which are far too often carried out with simple rules-of-thumb methods.

This book takes a pragmatic approach to deploying state-of-the-art optical networking equipment in metro-core and backbone networks. The book is oriented towards practical implementation of optical network design. Algorithms and methodologies related to routing, regeneration, wavelength assignment, sub rate-traffic grooming and protection are presented, with an emphasis on optical-bypass-enabled (or all-optical) networks. The author has emphasized the economics of optical networking, with a full chapter of economic studies that offer guidelines as to when and how optical-bypass technology should be deployed. This new edition contains: new chapter on dynamic optical networking and a new chapter on flexible/elastic optical networks. Expanded coverage of new physical-layer technology (e.g., coherent detection) and its impact on network design and enhanced coverage of ROADM architectures and properties, including colorless, directionless, contentionless and gridless. Covers 'hot' topics, such as Software Defined Networking and energy efficiency, algorithmic advancements and techniques, especially in the area of impairment-aware routing and wavelength assignment. Provides more illustrative examples of concepts are provided, using three reference networks (the topology files for the networks are provided on a web site, for further studies by the reader). Also exercises have been added at the end of the chapters to enhance the book's utility as a course textbook.

In this book, an attempt is made to address some of the remaining technical challenges of the phase change optical recording such as higher data storage capacity at lower $/Mb, higher speed data transfer and prolonged thermal & chemical stability of written marks over long usages. The first part of the book provide an insight into the intense development efforts that resulted in an optimized material composition (Sb100-x-ySnxIny)P(ZnS-SiO2)Q that is used as the parent recording material to develop Blu-ray Recordable (BDR) L2H discs that meet the current standard specifications but could be mass produced at significantly lower costs.Second part of the book illustrates the work related to the addition of indium into (SbxTe1-x)y Ge1-y matrix for improving the crystallization speed of Sb69Te31 composition that led to the successful discovery of a new 1X-2.5X BDRE format (current specification is 1X-2X only). The third part of the book lists the successful attempts to improve the archival life of CDRW media format with the introduction of an optimized concentration of N2 as a dopant during the course of sputtering of phase change layer.

Chris Barney's Pattern Language for Game Design builds on the revolutionary work of architect Christopher Alexander to show students, teachers, and game development professionals how to derive best practices in all aspects of game design. Using a series of practical, rigorous exercises, designers can observe and analyze the failures and successes of the games they know and love to find the deep patterns that underlie good design. From an in-depth look at Alexander's work, to a critique of pattern theory in various fields, to a new approach that will challenge your knowledge and put it to work, this book seeks to transform how we look at building the interactive experiences that shape us.  Key Features: 　   Background on the architectural concepts of patterns and a Pattern Language as defined in the work of Christopher Alexander, including his later work on the Fifteen Properties of Wholeness and Generative Codes.   Analysis of other uses of Alexander's work in computer science and game design, and the limitations of those efforts.   A comprehensive set of example exercises to help the reader develop their own patterns that can be used in practical day-to-day game design tasks.　   Exercises that are useful to designers at all levels of experience and can be completed in any order, allowing students to select exercises that match their coursework and allowing professionals to select exercises that address their real-world challenges.　   Discussion of common pitfalls and difficulties with the pattern derivation process.   A guide for game design teachers, studio leaders, and university departments for curating and maintaining institutional Pattern Languages.   An Interactive Pattern Language website where you can share patterns with developers throughout the world (patternlanguageforgamedesign.com).   Comprehensive games reference for all games discussed in this book.   　 　 Author Chris Barney is an industry veteran with more than a decade of experience designing and engineering games such as Poptropica and teaching at Northeastern University. He has spoken at conferences, including GDC, DevCom, and PAX, on topics from core game design to social justice. Seeking degrees in game design before formal game design programs existed, Barney built his own undergraduate and graduate curricula out of offerings in sociology, computer science, and independent study. In pursuit of a broad understanding of games, he has worked on projects spanning interactive theater, live-action role-playing game (LARP) design, board games, and tabletop role-playing games (RPGs).

A series of 16 case studies that demonstrate how industry makes use of the best practices found in the text The Mechanical Design Process, 6th edition and the book Scrum for Hardware Design. Case studies have long been used in business schools but only rarely in engineering studies. However, studying how professionals have solved design problems is one window on the design process that is useful to students and practitioners. What is unique about these case studies is they are not overly academic as they are co-written by practicing engineers to show real world examples of good practice. The case studies range from those featuring very small companies to NASA and BMW. They range from the design of bicycles to heat exchangers. They include systems that are solely of hardware to those with integrated electronics and software.

This textbook introduces readers to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. The only pre-requisite is algebra, so it can be taken by college freshman or sophomore students or even used in Advanced Placement courses in high school. This book presents both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). This textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach while ensuring they have a solid foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the content with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the learner should be able to ""do"" after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure learner performance on each outcome. This book can be used for either a sequence of two courses consisting of an introduction to logic circuits (Chapters 1-7) followed by logic design (Chapters 8-13) or a single, accelerated course that uses the early chapters as reference material.

This book is intended to meet the needs of those who seek to develop control systems for ROVs when there is no model available during the initial design stage. The modeling, simulation and application of marine vehicles like underwater robotic vehicles (URVs) are multidisciplinary, and combine mathematical aspects from various engineering disciplines. URVs such as remotely operated vehicle (ROVs) are used for a wide range of applications such as exploring the extreme depths of our ocean, where a hard-wired link is still required. Most ROVs operate in extreme environments with uncertainties in the model prior to control system design. However, the method involved extensive testing before the system model could be used for any control actions. It has been found that the range of error can be extensive and uncertain in actual, continuously varying conditions. Hence, it is important to address the problem of reliance on model testing using different modeling approaches. In this book, approaches such as WAMIT, ANSYS-CFX, STAR CCM+, MATLAB and Simulink are used to model parameters for ROVs. A few benchmark models are provided, allowing researchers and students to explore and test different control schemes. Given its scope, the book offers a valuable reference guide for postgraduate and undergraduate students engaged in modeling and simulation for ROV control.

The rail network plays an essential role in transport infrastructure worldwide. A ballasted track is commonly used for several reasons, including economic considerations, load bearing capacity, rapid drainage and ease of maintenance. Given the ever-increasing demand for trains to carry heavier axle loads at greater speeds, traditional design and construction must undergo inevitable changes for sustainable performance. Ballast is an unbounded granular assembly that displaces when subjected to repeated train loading affecting track stability. During heavy haul operations, ballast progressively deteriorates and the infiltration of fluidized fines (mud pumping) from the underlying substructure and subgrade decreases its shear strength and also impedes drainage, while increasing track deformation and associated maintenance.Features: serves as a useful guide to assist the practitioner in new track design as well as remediating existing tracks.research discussed in this book has made considerable impact on the railway industry.resulting from collaborative research between academia and industry, incorporating sophisticated laboratory tests, computational modelling and field studies.This book presents a comprehensive procedure for the design of ballasted tracks based on a rational approach that combines extensive laboratory testing, computational modelling and field measurements conducted over the past two decades. Ballast Railroad Design: SMART-UOW Approach will not only become an imperative design aid for rail practitioners, but will also be a valuable resource for postgraduate students and researchers alike in railway engineering.

Computer simulations based on mathematical models have become ubiquitous across the engineering disciplines and throughout the physical sciences. Successful use of a simulation model, however, requires careful interrogation of the model through systematic computer experiments. While specific theoretical/mathematical examinations of computer experiment design are available, those interested in applying proposed methodologies need a practical presentation and straightforward guidance on analyzing and interpreting experiment results. Written by authors with strong academic reputations and real-world practical experience, Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments is exactly the kind of treatment you need. The authors blend a sound, modern statistical approach with extensive engineering applications and clearly delineate the steps required to successfully model a problem and provide an analysis that will help find the solution. Part I introduces the design and modeling of computer experiments and the basic concepts used throughout the book. Part II focuses on the design of computer experiments. The authors present the most popular space-filling designs - like Latin hypercube sampling and its modifications and uniform design - including their definitions, properties, construction and related generating algorithms. Part III discusses the modeling of data from computer experiments. Here the authors present various modeling techniques and discuss model interpretation, including sensitivity analysis. An appendix reviews the statistics and mathematics concepts needed, and numerous examples clarify the techniques and their implementation. The complexity of real physical systems means that there is usually no simple analytic formula that sufficiently describes the phenomena. Useful both as a textbook and professional reference, this book presents the techniques you need to design and model computer experiments for practical problem solving.

There has been an increasing demand in GIS for systems that support historical data: time-series data as well as mobility information. From a modelling perspective, there are advantages in integrating object-oriented analysis and design to databases as well as to visualisation capabilities of GIS.Object-Oriented Design for Temporal GIS explores the major components of the object-oriented analysis and design methods, how they can be used for modelling spatio-temporal data, and how these components are developed and maintained within a GIS. It also offers practical guidance to object-oriented methods by demonstrating the feasibility of applying such methods to issues involved in handling spatio-temporal data. The author demonstrates how this knowledge might be used in a wide range of applications such as political boundary record maintenance (historical data), disease incidence rate analysis in epidemics (diffusion rate), and environmental studies of climate change (time-series data). This understanding contributes to the development of theory in GIS and improves the design of GIS to support the modelling of semantics, space and time elements of geographical information.

This book provides a manual for the technical and structural design of systems for supplying decentralised energy in residential buildings. It presents the micro-combined cooling, heating & power systems Stirling engines & renewable energy sources (mCCHP-SE-RES) systems in an accessible manner both for the public at large, and for professionals who conceive, design or commercialise such systems or their components. The high performance levels of these systems are demonstrated within the final chapter by the results of an experiment in which a house is equipped with a mCCHP-SE-RES system. The reader is also familiarized with the conceptual, technical and legal aspects of modern domestic energy systems; the components that constitute these systems; and advanced algorithms for achieving the structural and technical design of such systems.In residential buildings, satisfying demands of durable development has gradually evolved from necessity to obligation and institutionalisation. Consequently a major paradigm change has appeared in the supply of energy to residential buildings, from the centralised production of energy using fossil fuels to the decentralised production of energy using local renewable sources. Furthermore, on the energy system market, energy micro systems which use renewable energy sources are increasingly commercialised. From among these, the mCCHP-SE-RES systems are particularly striking because they offer a high performance and they enhance the relationship between humans and the environment. This book is intended for postgraduate students of electrical engineering, applied mathematicians, and researchers of modelling and control of complex systems or power system technologies.

Cyclic Redundancy Check is the most powerful of the redundancy checking techniques.CRC continues to be best suited for network based applications, which are characterized by medium level noise. In this book, The aim is designing and implementing a CRC circuit architecture, which is reconfigurable in terms of CRC polynomial and message size using FPGA. It is best suited for communication between PCs, where error detection and retransmission is of main concern rather than error correction.The FPGA serves as the control unit to facilitate the communication between the PCs. Frequency division is performed to match the speed between the computer and the FPGA.The implementation is done up to 32-bit CRC polynomial. Appropriate CRC selection is done using a look up table depending on the applicationThe resulting circuit is of reduced cost, improved speed and significant capabilities to operate an extensive range of CRC polynomials and message width instead of just one.

In the present era Adding Technology and Innovations in Agriculture will help in increasing crop productivity. The motive to use development in Agriculture is not only to increase productivity but also to take care of our Farmers and Future Generations and one such way to achieve it is by using Agricultural Drones. One of the main sources (around 70%) of income in India is Agriculture. The production rate of crops in agriculture is based on various parameters like temperature, humidity, rain, etc. which are natural factors and are not in farmer's control. The field of agriculture also depends on some other factors like pests, disease, fertilizers, etc. which can be controlled by giving proper treatment to crops. Pesticides may increase the productivity of crops but they also affect human health. The WHO (World Health Organization) estimated as one million cases of ill effected when spraying the pesticides in the crop filed manually. Agriculture drone can be used as a form of Precision Agriculture by managing to spray the fertilizer as per requirement.

A Photovoltaic power system is a system that uses light energy from the sun by converting it into electricity which might or might not be connected to the national grid. Solar radiation was collected by a Pyranometer installed at house rooftop in Otjomuise, Windhoek. The data was used to determine the size of photovoltaic generator required to produce electricity to meet the user demand. This project describes the steps followed while designing a PV system that will produce electricity for the University of Namibia (main campus) at a later stage. A 25.2 kWp grid connected PV system was designed and installed on Y-block rooftop, to meet the university daily energy demand and its annual energy output for the first year was estimated to be about 57.67 MWh.

It includes seven chapters that contains most of the technical content required for the students to design, build and drive their rovers under RC control during the fall quarter. We have included Chapter 2 on Development Teams because student design teams often have difficulty functioning smoothly. In addition to the mission oriented content, we have added Chapter 7 on 3D Printing.Part II is titled Design, Build an Autonomous Rover. It contains the content for the winter quarter, during which the students are formed into teams of four students who design, build and autonomously drive their Rover on a specified mission. Part II contains four chapters that provide the content that the students can reference as they complete their assignment.Finally Part III is titled Engineering Skills. It includes nine chapters that contain content often covered in more traditional Introduction to Engineering courses. We recommend that students refer to these chapters, as they consider a career in Engineering. Of particular importance is Chapter 13 titled A Student Survival Guide, which provides a systematic approach to successfully completing your engineering studies. We also strongly recommend that you read Chapter 18 on Engineering Ethics and Design, which is focused on issues that arise in engineering. Finally, Chapter 20 provides a brief description of the interface between Engineering and Society.

This book investigates the characteristics of simple versus complex systems, and what the properties of a cyber-physical system design are that contribute to an effective implementation and make the system understandable, simple to use, and easy to maintain. The targeted audience is engineers, managers and advanced students who are involved in the design of cyber-physical systems and are willing to spend some time outside the silo of their daily work in order to widen their background and appreciation for the pervasive problems of system complexity.In the past, design of a process-control system (now called cyber-physical systems) was more of an art than an engineering endeavor. The software technology of that time was concerned primarily with functional correctness and did not pay much attention to the temporal dimension of program execution, which is as important as functional correctness when a physical process must be controlled. In the ensuing years, many problems in the design of cyber-physical systems were simplified. But with an increase in the functional requirements and system size, the complexity problems have appeared again in a different disguise. A sound understanding of the complexity problem requires some insight in cognition, human problem solving, psychology, and parts of philosophy.This book presents the essence of the author's thinking about complexity, accumulated over the past forty years.

Controller Design for Distributed Parameter Systems,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108697374?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=38,"Kirsten A,Morris",Springer    ,9783030349486.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9486/9783030349486.jpg,"

This book addresses controller and estimator design for systems that vary both spatially and in time: systems like fluid flow, acoustic noise and flexible structures. It includes coverage of the selection and placement of actuators and sensors for such distributed-parameter systems. The models for distributed parameter systems are coupled ordinary/partial differential equations. Approximations to the governing equations, often of very high order, are required and this complicates both controller design and optimization of the hardware locations. Control system and estimator performance depends not only on the controller/estimator design but also on the location of the hardware. In helping the reader choose the best location for actuators and sensors, the analysis provided in this book is crucial because neither intuition nor trial-and-error is foolproof, especially where multiple sensors and actuators are required, and moving hardware can be difficult and costly. The mechatronic approach advocated, in which controller design is integrated with actuator location, can lead to better performance without increased cost. Similarly, better estimation can be obtained with carefully placed sensors. The text shows how proper hardware placement varies depending on whether, disturbances are present, whether the response should be reduced to an initial condition or whether controllability and/or observability have to be optimized.  This book is aimed at non-specialists interested in learning controller design for distributed-parameter systems and the material presented has been used for student teaching. The relevant basic systems theory is presented and followed by a description of controller synthesis using lumped approximations. Numerical algorithms useful for efficient implementation in real engineering systems and practical computational challenges are also described and discussed.

Surface texturing has been recognized as a method for enhancing the tribological properties of surfaces for many years. Adding a controlled texture to one of two faces in relative motion can have many positive effects, such as reduction of friction and wear and increase in load capacity. To date, the true potential of texturing has not been realized due to the severe lack of detailed information about the mechanistic functional details of texturing in a tribological situation. Inspiration and Design for Bio-Inspired Surfaces in Tribology: Emerging Research and Opportunities is a pivotal reference source that focuses on surface engineering techniques to mimic biological materials. Highlighting a broad range of topics including bio-mimetics, contact analysis, and thermodynamics, this book is ideally designed for engineers, environmentalists, academicians, researchers, and students.

An Update of the Most Practical A-to-Z Operating System BookWidely lauded for avoiding the typical black box approach found in other operating system textbooks, the first edition of this bestselling book taught readers how an operating system works and explained how to build it from the ground up. Continuing to follow a logical pattern for system design, Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach, Second Edition removes the mystery from operating system design and consolidates the body of material into a systematic discipline. It presents a hierarchical design paradigm that organizes major operating system components in an orderly, understandable manner. The book guides readers through the construction of a conventional process-based operating system using practical, straightforward primitives. It gives the implementation details of one set of primitives, usually the most popular set. Once readers understand how primitives can be implemented on conventional hardware, they can then easily implement alternative versions.The text begins with a bare machine and proceeds step-by-step through the design and implementation of Xinu, which is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions. The Xinu code runs on many hardware platforms. This second edition has been completely rewritten to contrast operating systems for RISC and CISC processors. Encouraging hands-on experimentation, the book provides updated code throughout and examples for two low-cost experimenter boards: BeagleBone Black from ARM and Galileo from Intel.

Modern Well Design - Second Edition presents a unified approach to the well design process and drilling operations. Following an introduction to the field, the second chapter addresses drilling fluids, as well as optimal mud weight, hole cleaning, hydraulic optimization, and methods to handle circulation losses. A relatively large chapter on geomechanics follows, presenting methods for wellbore fracture and collapse modeling, including methods to interpret caliper logs. Contains a new generalized fracture model suitable for deep-water drillingThe start of any well design is to collect data and establish the design premises. To this end, Chapter Four presents well integrity issues, methods to select depths of casing seats, and also some important completion and production requirements. This encourages the design of a plan to last for the entire life of the well, defining loads that it may be subjected to at later stages. Chapters Five and Six describe actual well design in the North Sea and a sub-sea high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well. Chapter Seven also addresses issues related to well integrity, and presents statistics regarding failures with production and injection wells. Written for those performing work related to petroleum wells, including drilling and production engineers, drilling supervisors, and exploration geologists, this book can also serve as the basis for curriculums in well design courses for engineers at the undergraduate and graduate level.

Web 2.0 makes headlines, but how does it make money? This concise guide explains what's different about Web 2.0 and how those differences can improve your company's bottom line. Whether you're an executive plotting the next move, a small business owner looking to expand, or an entrepreneur planning a startup, Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide illustrates through real-life examples how businesses, large and small, are creating new opportunities on today's Web.This book is about strategy. Rather than focus on the technology, the examples concentrate on its effect. You will learn that creating a Web 2.0 business, or integrating Web 2.0 strategies with your existing business, means creating places online where people like to come together to share what they think, see, and do. When people come together over the Web, the result can be much more than the sum of the parts. The customers themselves help build the site, as old-fashioned ""word of mouth"" becomes hypergrowth.Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide demonstrates the power of this new paradigm by examining how: Flickr, a classic user-driven business, created value for itself by helping users create their own valueGoogle made money with a model based on free search, and changed the rules for doing business on the Web-opening opportunities you can take advantage ofSocial network effects can support a business-ever wonder how FaceBook grew so quickly?Businesses like Amazon tap into the Web as a source of indirect revenue, using creative new approaches to monetize the investments they've made in the WebWritten by Amy Shuen, an authority on Silicon Valley business models and innovation economics, Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide explains how to transform your business by looking at specific practices for integrating Web 2.0 with what you do.

Fully updated and expanded from the previous edition, A Practical Guide to Database Design, Second Edition is intended for those involved in the design or development of a database system or application. It begins by illustrating how to develop a Third Normal Form data model where data is placed ""where it belongs"". The reader is taken step-by-step through the Normalization process, first using a simple then a more complex set of data requirements. Next, usage analysis for each Logical Data Model is reviewed and a Physical Data Model is produced that will satisfy user performance requirements. Finally, each Physical Data Model is used as input to create databases using both Microsoft Access and SQL Server.The book next shows how to use an industry-leading data modeling tool to define and manage logical and physical data models, and how to create Data Definition Language statements to create or update a database running in SQL Server, Oracle, or other type of DBMS.One chapter is devoted to illustrating how Microsoft Access can be used to create user interfaces to review and update underlying tables in that database as well as tables residing in SQL Server or Oracle.For users involved with Cyber activity or support, one chapter illustrates how to extract records of interest from a log file using PERL, then shows how to load these extracted records into one or more SQL Server ""tracking"" tables adding status flags for analysts to use when reviewing activity of interest. These status flags are used to flag/mark collected records as ""Reviewed"", ""Pending"" (currently being analyzed) and ""Resolved"". The last chapter then shows how to build a web-based GUI using PHP to query these tracking tables and allow an analyst to review new activity, flag items that need to be investigated, and finally flag items that have been investigated and resolved. Note that the book has complete code/scripts for both PERL and the PHP GUI.

Real-world engineering problems often require concurrent optimization of several design objectives, which are conflicting in cases. This type of optimization is generally called multi-objective or multi-criterion optimization. The area of research that applies evolutionary methodologies to multi-objective optimization is of special and growing interest. It brings a viable computational solution to many real-world problems. Generally, multi-objective engineering problems do not have a straightforward optimal design. These kinds of problems usually inspire several solutions of equal efficiency, which achieve different trade-offs. Decision makers' preferences are normally used to select the most adequate design. Such preferences may be dictated before or after the optimization takes place. They may also be introduced interactively at different levels of the optimization process. Multi-objective optimization methods can be subdivided into classical and evolutionary. The classical methods usually aim at a single solution while the evolutionary methods provide a whole set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. Evolutionary Multi-Objective System Design: Theory and Applicationsprovides a representation of the state-of-the-art in evolutionary multi-objective optimization research area and related new trends. It reports many innovative designs yielded by the application of such optimization methods. It also presents the application of multi-objective optimization to the following problems: Embrittlement of stainless steel coated electrodesLearning fuzzy rules from imbalanced datasets Combining multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with collective intelligenceFuzzy gain scheduling controlSmart placement of roadside units in vehicular networksCombining multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with quasi-simplex local searchDesign of robust substitution boxesProtein structure prediction problemCore assignment for efficient network-on-chip-based system design

Despite an astonishing 100 million-fold range in adult body mass from bumblebee bat to blue whale, all mammals are formed of the same kinds of molecules, cells, tissues and organs and to the same overall body plan. A scaling approach investigates the principles of mammal design by examining the ways in which mammals of diverse size and taxonomy are quantitatively comparable. This book presents an extensive reanalysis of scaling data collected over a quarter of a century, including many rarely or never-cited sources. The result is an unparalleled contribution to understanding scaling in mammals, addressing a uniquely extensive range of mammal attributes and using substantially larger and more rigorously screened samples than in any prior works. An invaluable resource for all those interested in the 'design' of mammals, this is an ideal resource for postgraduates and researchers in a range of fields from comparative physiology to ecology.

Design is about the creation of meaningful connections to solve problems and advance human wellbeing; the discipline has always explored the beneficial links between form and function, technology and meaning, beauty and utility, people and artefacts and problems and solutions, among others. This book focuses on the crucial connection between design research and design education.   Contemporary society grows increasingly hyper-complex and globally competitive. This state of affairs raises fundamental questions for both Design Education and Design Research: Should research skills be integrated into undergraduate courses? How can we modify design courses without compromising the positive aspects of the educational studio experience? Can the three cycles of higher education in design be combined into a creative and inquisitive educational continuum?  To examine the relationship between research and education in Design we must address the topic of knowledge, keeping in mind that the development and dissemination of new and useful knowledge is the core purpose of a University. If we agree that design has its own things to know and ways to find out about them, then design knowledge resides in people, processes, products, and philosophy. This book explores the intersection of these four areas with the aim of uncovering insights to advance the current state of the design discipline.

Design and Development of Nanostructured Thin Films,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c005120099?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=40,"Cavaliere,Sara",Mdpi AG,9783039287383.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/7383/9783039287383.jpg,"

Due to their unique size-dependent physicochemical properties, nanostructured thin films are used in a wide range of applications from smart coating and drug delivery to electrocatalysis and highly-sensitive sensors. Depending on the targeted application and the deposition technique, these materials have been designed and developed by tuning their atomic-molecular 2D- and/or 3D-aggregation, thickness, crystallinity, and porosity, having effects on their optical, mechanical, catalytic, and conductive properties. Several open questions remain about the impact of nanomaterial production and use on environment and health. Many efforts are currently being made not only to prevent nanotechnologies and nanomaterials from contributing to environmental pollution but also to design nanomaterials to support, control, and protect the environment. This Special Issue aims to cover the recent advances in designing nanostructured films focusing on environmental issues related to their fabrication processes (e.g., low power and low cost technologies, the use of environmentally friendly solvents), their precursors (e.g., waste-recycled, bio-based, biodegradable, and natural materials), their applications (e.g., controlled release of chemicals, mimicking of natural processes, and clean energy conversion and storage), and their use in monitoring environment pollution (e.g., sensors optically- or electrically-sensitive to pollutants)

This paper presents natural frequency and stress of opto-mechanical structure. In this study, an opto-mechanical structure was investigated.The opto-mechanical structure includes lens assembly and detector head assembly (DHA). The opto-mechanical structure requires high stability and position accuracy. In this design and analysis study, wide ranges of the opto-mechanical structural analysis have been performed including: Natural frequency analysis and dynamic analysis. Opto-mechanical design includes material selection and mechanical design. Payload structure design will be based on stiffness. Hence, Natural frequency is major design criteria for opto-mechanical design of payload structure. At higher vibration during launching time, resonance will be created and parts will be misaligned or may be damaged. Objective of this work is to reach maximum natural frequency with minimum stress on opto-mechanical structure.

Do you want to turn your talent for writing into a narrative design career in the games industry?  It's never been a better time to be a writer for video games. You're tapping into an industry that was worth more than $120 billion dollars in 2019, and it's still growing.  And it's an industry that needs great storytellers.  But there's a BIG difference between a great story and a great game story. Traditional stories are told. Game stories are experienced. That's why video game narratives need a totally different design approach.  So how do you apply your scriptwriting, storylining, poetic, copywriting, prose producing skills to an audience that won't sit still and an industry that's ever changing?  That's what this book is about!  I've been a narrative designer for over a decade, as well as a novelist and a scriptwriter / storyliner for TV and comics. I love playing games, and even more, I love helping game developers realize their storytelling aspirations. Nothing delights me more than a game that's both fun to play and delivers a satisfying story experience.  In this book, I'll share both the evergreen principles and practical techniques that I've learned and developed during my narrative design career so that you can position yourself for your first game writing gig. And if you're an experienced narrative designer already, you'll still find plenty of insights that you can apply to your trade.  I'll say it again, ""the games industry needs you!""  Play is what we do, but story is why we do it.

A New Approach for Understanding the Mechanism and Drug Design of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Responsive Protein,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200319060?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=40,"Gyan,Prakash Rai",Eliva Press,9781952751516.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1516/9781952751516.jpg,"

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood cancer. In CML cancer, stem cells of bone marrow form abnormal WBCs that hinder the function of normal RBCs and WBCs. CML occurs due to a chromosomal translocation between BCR gene on Chromosome-22 and ABL gene on Chromosome-9. The purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway consists of three enzymes (hIMPDH, hGMPS and hGMPR) which are identified to be responsible for CML cancer and they are also involved in cellular metabolic pathways that exhibit elevated levels of activity in rapidly proliferating cells, such as neoplastic and regenerating tissues. These CML responsive proteins exist as type-I and II isoforms. Isoform-II is responsible for CML cancer, whereas isoform-I which keeps a housekeeping role, and observed in normal cells. Our in-silico methods may explore some new biochemical mechanism and novel conformation of this protein that may be effective for future drug discovery. The basic problem for discovery of drugs for CML cancer protein is that all proposed inhibitors bind to CML cancerous and normal protein, as a result both normal and cancer cells lose their function and die. To design the drugs for CML cancerous protein, isoform specific (type-II) drug design techniques were employed in this study and the new inhibitors were identified by computational method using different databases. The computationally designed proposed drugs can be effective to recognize the CML cancer protein and may act as a good drug candidate for CML cancer.

This monograph presents a new analytical approach to the design of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for linear time-invariant plants. The authors develop a computer-aided procedure, to synthesize PID controllers that satisfy multiple design specifications. A geometric approach, which can be used to determine such designs methodically using 2- and 3-D computer graphics is the result.The text expands on the computation of the complete stabilizing set previously developed by the authors and presented here. This set is then systematically exploited to achieve multiple design specifications simultaneously. These specifications include classical gain and phase margins, time-delay tolerance, settling time and H-infinity norm bounds. The results are developed for continuous- and discrete-time systems. An extension to multivariable systems is also included.Analytical Design of PID Controllers provides a novel method of designing PID controllers, which makes it ideal for both researchers and professionals working in traditional industries as well as those connected with unmanned aerial vehicles, driverless cars and autonomous robots.

When the question about audience is raised, audio and visual representations come to mind for effectiveness and better knowledge of any particular exposition. Display is very key and vital in satisfying the urge of the audience to gain knowledge. It has been proven that knowledge gained through sight is more retained in the brain than the one gained through other senses organs. Hence, there will always be continual development and researches to make such visual displays better, and more efficient to use. God gave man the ability to think and develop his immediate community; over the years, a lot of improvements have been made to this effect. Exhibitions are made on a regular basis all over the world. In this part of the world, the primitiveness of these presentations has been a major concern over the years. Technological advancements have about many effective way of improving the quality and the ease of making these presentations. Most presentations were simply oral or diagrammatic.

This textbook for courses in Digital Systems Design introduces students to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. Coverage includes both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). Using this textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach, but they have a broad foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the presentation with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the student should be able to ""do"" after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure student performance on each outcome.

Design now has many meanings. For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others it is fitting things to people. These differences reflect disciplinary values that both overlap and diverge. All involve artefacts: we always design things. Each definition considers people and purpose in some way.

There are both merits and risks in these differences, without an appropriate balance. Poor balance can result from professions claiming the centre of design for their discipline, marginalising others. Process can also cause imbalance when allocating resources to scheduled stages.

This book introduces the concept of worth for design teams, relates it to experiences and outcomes, and describes how to focus on worth when researching and expressing design opportunities for generous worth. Truly interdisciplinary teams also need an appropriate common language, which was developed in the companion book Worth-Focused Design, Book 1: Balance, Integration, and Generosity (Cockton, 2020a). Its new lexicon for design progressions enables a framework for design and evaluation that works well with a worth focus. Design now has different meanings based upon the approach of different disciplinary practices. For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others, it is fitting things to people (beneficiaries). While each of these design foci has merits, there are risks in not having an appropriate balance across professions that claim the centre of design for their discipline and marginalise others. Generosity is key to the best creative design-delivering unexpected worth beyond documented needs, wants, or pain points. Truly interdisciplinary design must also balance and integrate approaches across several communities of practice, which is made easier by common ground. Worth provides a productive focus for this common ground and is symbiotic with balanced, integrated, and generous (BIG) practices. Practices associated with balance and integration for worth-focused generosity are illustrated in several case studies that have used approaches in this book, complementing them with additional practices.

This book develops an appropriate common language for truly interdisciplinary teams involved in design. Design now has many meanings. For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others, it is fitting things to people. These differences reflect disciplinary values that both overlap and diverge. All involve artefacts: we always design things. Each definition considers people and purpose in some way. Each handles evaluation differently, measuring against aesthetics, craft standards, specifications, sales, usage experiences, or usage outcomes. There are both merits and risks in these differences, without an appropriate balance. Poor balance can result from professions claiming the centre of design for their discipline, marginalising others. Process can also cause imbalance when allocating resources to scheduled stages.

Bachelor Thesis from the year 2018 in the subject Engineering - Mechanical Engineering, grade: 75%, University of Thi-Qar, language: English, abstract: The project is about designing and building a digital controller that manages the opening and closing of a sliding gate. This gate exists in front of the workshops of college of engineering. The controller consists of remote control and cards reader. Each card has a code which can be detected by the radio frequency identification (RFID). For registered cards the gate will open for a while then closing automatically, the cards-reader supported on a column which is near enough for the drivers to attach the cards to. On the other hand, the remote can open and close the gate for any level. Arduino has many features over other microcontrollers, it is cheap, small in size has a simple programming environment and open-source software and hardware. The Arduino software runs on Windows and Linux operating systems.

The most important environmental challenge today's society is facing is to reduce the effects of CO2 emissions and global warming. Such an ambitious challenge can only be achieved through a holistic approach, capable of tackling the problem from a multidisciplinary point of view. One of the core technologies called to play a critical role in this approach is the use of energy storage systems. These systems enable, among other things, the balancing of the stochastic behavior of Renewable Sources and Distributed Generation in modern Energy Systems; the efficient supply of industrial and consumer loads; the development of efficient and clean transport; and the development of Nearly-Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) and intelligent cities. Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) consist of two (or more) storage devices with complementary key characteristics, that are able to behave jointly with better performance than any of the technologies considered individually. Recent developments in storage device technologies, interface systems, control and monitoring techniques, or visualization and information technologies have driven the implementation of HESS in many industrial, commercial and domestic applications. This Special Issue focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of hybrid energy storage systems across a broad spectrum, encompassing different storage technologies (including electrochemical, capacitive, mechanical or mechanical storage devices), engineering branches (power electronics and control strategies; energy engineering; energy engineering; chemistry; modelling, simulation and emulation techniques; data analysis and algorithms; social and economic analysis; intelligent and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems; and so on.), applications (energy systems, renewable energy generation, industrial applications, transportation, Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and critical load supply, etc.) and evaluation and performance (size and weight benefits, efficiency and power loss, economic analysis, environmental costs, etc.).

Offshore structures were part of the CCPP construction in Vlore, Albania. These structures were composed of an SBM/CALM for fuel oil downloading and an intake and discharge structure for cooling water.In order to make all the engineering design for the above mentioned structures it was required winds and wave information. This data includes climates and extreme conditions for winds and waves, tidal current data and tidal ranges. In this study are presented the derivation of these conditions. For this study the SWAN wave refraction model was used to predict wave conditions at the site of the SBM/CALM for both extreme events and annually averaged climates.

Reinforced concrete structures are one of the major structural types and must adhere to design regulation codes. It is ideal to find the best design (section dimension, material type, and amount of reinforcement) with the minimum cost providing the design constraints (design formulation considering loading of structure). Metaheuristic methods inspired by natural phenomena can consider design constraints by combining the analyses of formulation of reinforced concrete structures with an iterative numerical algorithm using several convergence options of random generation of candidate design solutions. Metaheuristic Approaches for Optimum Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures: Emerging Research and Opportunities is a pivotal reference source that focuses on several metaheuristic algorithms and the design of several types of structural members. Additionally, retrofit applications and seismic design issues are considered for readers in earthquake zones. Highlighting a wide range of topics including algorithms, design variables, and retrofit design, this book is ideally designed for architects, engineers, urban designers, government officials, policymakers, researchers, academicians, and students.

A corona ring on an insulator string on a transmission line is one of the solutions to reduce the electric field stress surrounding the energized end of the insulator string. However, to reduce the electric field magnitude on an insulator string with an optimum design is a challenging task. An optimization methods; Gravitational Search Algorithm and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm were proposed in this work. An insulator string model geometry with a corona ring was modeled in a finite element analysis software. The electric field distribution was evaluated using variation of corona ring dimensions, i.e. the ring diameter, the ring tube diameter and the vertical position of the ring along the insulator string. The insulator string with a corona ring design shows the minimum electric field magnitude using optimization techniques. Hence, this indicates the capability of the proposed methods in achieving an optimum design of a corona ring on an insulator string.

A boost-buck (BB) DC-DC converter is proposed for solar photovoltaic (SPV) array fed water pumping system using a permanent magnet brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive. To design a BB converter with suitable voltage control, DC-DC boost and buck converters are cascaded such that it accomplishes the purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and soft starting of the BLDC motor. The BB converter exhibits the advantages of both the boost and buck converters and interestingly emerges as a solution to problems associated with these converters in SPV applications. The good switch utilization, high efficiency, non-inverting output voltage and low stress on power devices are the features of BB converter. This paper deals with the starting, dynamic and steady state performances under varying atmospheric conditions and examines the effectiveness of the BLDC motor with the proposed BB converter for SPV based water pumping. Simulated results using MATLAB/Simulink followed by the experimental validation have demonstrated the suitability of this drive for SPV based water pumping system

The communication between high speed and low speed devices is the major issue in the design of any processor and controllers. Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is a protocol that is used as an open standard onchip interconnect specification for the connection and management of the functional blocks in system on chip (SoC). This Book describes the implementation of AMBA interface between high performance bus and low performance bus based on AMBA 2.0 specification. The design of Advanced High performance Bus (AHB) and Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) interface modules are designed using verilog HDL based on the finite state machine operation. The AMBA interface is designed for 32-bit data transfer between AHB and APB module. The designed interface is tested by data transfer between peripheral end modules to processor end module in simulation environment using Xilinx ISE 13.4 design suite with ModelSim 6.3f simulator. The Virtex 5 XC5VLX110T-1FF1136 FPGA is used for hardware implementation of AMBA interface.

When most people go to the airport, they may notice that every airplane looks the same, and the way that airplanes look - and what they can do - hasn't really changed since the 1950s. A natural conclusion is that designing airplanes is not very interesting and does not require much creativity. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Around the world, engineers and scientists and academics - and inventors in their garages - are creating airplanes that implement bold new concepts that will shape the airplanes of the future.A book for kids of all ages, showing the latest, most creative, and most innovative ideas in the field of airplane design. These concepts are currently being tested and figured out. If the reader becomes an engineer in 10 or 20 years, they will use these new ideas - and their creativity! - to make the airplanes of the future better than those of today.The goal of the book is to get kids interested in an area of STEM that is growing very quickly: Every year, new designs are unveiled for drones, reusable spacecraft, ""flying cars"", electric or solar aircraft, futuristic airliners, and airplanes that can fly at extreme speeds and altitudes - or that can hover, and take off and land straight up and down like a helicopter.Younger kids will enjoy the pictures while having the text read to them. Older kids can use the book as a springboard for research into the many other innovative aircraft mentioned along the ones shown in the photos, to learn some of the fundamentals of aeronautical engineering.The book was written by a Boeing airplane designer who consulted with many people involved in unusual and innovative aircraft: The experts developing a Mach 5 airliner that can fly at the edge of space, the engineers who designed the world's most fuel-efficient helicopter (which can fly for 24 hours nonstop), the leaders of the organization that created one of the fastest jets in history, NASA researchers who work on the next generation of electric airplanes, flight instructors whose airplanes are the first to include amazing new safety features, and inventors who build futuristic airplanes in their garages and then fly them!The book illustrates these concepts by showing and explaining patents by Boeing and Airbus, futuristic concepts by NASA and Lockheed, record-breaking airplanes by Scaled Composites, research projects at universities, and photos of the latest experimental proof-of-concept airplanes doing things that no other airplane had ever done before!

Recent years have seen a growing number of calls for considering gender in the design or evaluation of software, websites, or other digital technology. Calls like these have arisen from an emerging awareness in HCI of findings from the social sciences that are relevant to the way people use and design technology. However, emerging work on bringing together gender research with software design choices is fragmented across multiple disciplines. This monograph aims to help bring such works together, by synthesizing the current state of affairs and future possibilities on how gender comes together with HCI design. The authors of this monograph consider inclusive design of technology whatever the gender of its users of particular importance. This conceptual review provides an overview of the motivations that have driven research in gender and inclusive HCI design. The authors review the empirical evidence for the impact of gender in thinking and behavior which underlies HCI research and design. They present how HCI design might inadvertently embed and perpetuate gender stereotypes. They also present current HCI design approaches to tackle gender stereotypes and produce gender-inclusive designs. The monograph concludes by discussing possible future directions in this area.

Games, whether educational or recreational, are meant to be fun. How do we ensure that the game delivers its intent? The answer to this question is playtesting. However, a haphazard playtest process cannot discover play experience from various dimensions. Players' perceptions, affordances, age, gender, culture, and many more human factors influence play experience. A playtest requires an intensive experimental process and scientific protocols to ensure that the outcomes seen are reliable for the designer. Playtesting and players' affordances are the focus of this book. This book is not just about the playtest procedures but also demonstrates how they lead to the conclusions obtained when considering data sets. The playtest process or playtest stories differ according to the hypothesis under investigation. We cover examples of playtesting to identify the impact of human factors, such as age and gender, to examine a player's preferences for game objects' design and colors. The book details topics to reflect on possible emotional outcomes of the player at the early stages of game design as well as the methodology for presenting questions to players in such a way as to elicit authentic feedback. This book is intended mainly for game designers, researchers, and developers. However, it provides a general understanding of affordances and human factors that can be informative for readers working in any domain.

Inclusive Design for a Digital World,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108387153?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=44,"Regine M,Gilbert",Apress      ,9781484250150.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/0150/9781484250150.jpg,"

What is inclusive design? It is simple. It means that your product has been created with the intention of being accessible to as many different users as possible. For a long time, the concept of accessibility has been limited in terms of only defining physical spaces. However, change is afoot: personal technology now plays a part in the everyday lives of most of us, and thus it is a responsibility for designers of apps, web pages, and more public-facing tech products to make them accessible to all. Our digital era brings progressive ideas and paradigm shifts - but they are only truly progressive if everybody can participate.In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, multiple crucial aspects of technological accessibility are confronted, followed by step-by-step solutions from User Experience Design professor and author Regine Gilbert. Think about every potential user who could be using your product. Could they be visually impaired? Have limited motor skills? Be deaf or hard of hearing? This book addresses a plethora of web accessibility issues that people with disabilities face. Your app might be blocking out an entire sector of the population without you ever intending or realizing it. For example, is your instructional text full of animated words and Emoji icons? This makes it difficult for a user with vision impairment to use an assistive reading device, such as a speech synthesizer, along with your app correctly. In Inclusive Design for a Digital World, Gilbert covers the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 requirements, emerging technologies such as VR and AR, best practices for web development, and more.As a creator in the modern digital era, your aim should be to make products that are inclusive of all people. Technology has, overall, increased connection and information equality around the world. To continue its impact, access and usability of such technology must be made a priority, and there is no better place to get started than Inclusive Design for a Digital World.What You'll LearnThe moral, ethical, and high level legal reasons for accessible designTools and best practices for user research and web developersThe different types of designs for disabilities on various platformsFamiliarize yourself with web compliance guidelinesTest products and usability best practicesUnderstand past innovations and future opportunities for continued improvementWho This Book Is ForPractitioners of product design, product development, content, and design can benefit from this book.

This volume contains lecture notes of the 14th Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2018), held in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, in September 2018. The research areas of Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Knowledge Graphs have recently received a lot of attention in academia and industry. Since its inception in 2001, the Semantic Web has aimed at enriching the existing Web with meta-data and processing methods, so as to provide Web-based systems with intelligent capabilities such as context awareness and decision support. The Semantic Web vision has been driving many community efforts which have invested a lot of resources in developing vocabularies and ontologies for annotating their resources semantically. Besides ontologies, rules have long been a central part of the Semantic Web framework and are available as one of its fundamental representation tools, with logic serving as a unifying foundation. Linked Data is a related research area which studies how one can make RDF data available on the Web and interconnect it with other data with the aim of increasing its value for everybody. Knowledge Graphs have been shown useful not only for Web search (as demonstrated by Google, Bing, etc.) but also in many application domains.

Database Design and Relational Theory,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c101282110?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=44,"Chris J,Date",Apress      ,9781484255391.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5391/9781484255391.jpg,"

Create database designs that scale, meet business requirements, and inherently work toward keeping your data structured and usable in the face of changing business models and software systems.This book is about database design theory. Design theory is the scientific foundation for database design, just as the relational model is the scientific foundation for database technology in general. Databases lie at the heart of so much of what we do in the computing world that negative impacts of poor design can be extraordinarily widespread. This second edition includes greatly expanded coverage of exotic and little understood normal forms such as: essential tuple normal form (ETNF), redundancy free normal form (RFNF), superkey normal form (SKNF), sixth normal form (6NF), and domain key normal form (DKNF). Also included are new appendixes, including one that provides an in-depth look into the crucial notion of data consistency. Sequencing of topics has been improved, and many explanations and examples have been rewritten and clarified based upon the author's teaching of the content in instructor-led courses. This book aims to be different from other books on design by bridging the gap between the theory of design and the practice of design. The book explains theory in a way that practitioners should be able to understand, and it explains why that theory is of considerable practical importance. Reading this book provides you with an important theoretical grounding on which to do the practical work of database design. Reading the book also helps you in going to and understanding the more academic texts as you build your base of knowledge and expertise. Anyone with a professional interest in database design can benefit from using this book as a stepping-stone toward a more rigorous design approach and more lasting database models.What You Will LearnUnderstand what design theory is and is notBe aware of the two different goals of normalizationKnow which normal forms are truly significant Apply design theory in practice Be familiar with techniques for dealing with redundancy Understand what consistency is and why it is crucially important  Who This Book Is ForThose having a professional interest in database design, including data and database administrators; educators and students specializing in database matters; information modelers and database designers; DBMS designers, implementers, and other database vendor personnel; and database consultants.

A gripping first-person account of how scientists came to understand our universe's mysterious structureJ. Richard Gott was among the first cosmologists to propose that the structure of our universe is like a sponge made up of clusters of galaxies intricately connected by filaments of galaxies--a magnificent structure now called the cosmic web and mapped extensively by teams of astronomers. Here is his gripping insider's account of how a generation of undaunted theorists and observers solved the mystery of the architecture of our cosmos.The Cosmic Web begins with modern pioneers of extragalactic astronomy, such as Edwin Hubble and Fritz Zwicky. It goes on to describe how, during the Cold War, the American school of cosmology favored a model of the universe where galaxies resided in isolated clusters, whereas the Soviet school favored a honeycomb pattern of galaxies punctuated by giant, isolated voids. Gott tells the stories of how his own path to a solution began with a high-school science project when he was eighteen, and how he and astronomer Mario Jurič measured the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies, a filament of galaxies that, at 1.37 billion light-years in length, is one of the largest structures in the universe.Drawing on Gott's own experiences working at the frontiers of science with many of today's leading cosmologists, The Cosmic Web shows how ambitious telescope surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are transforming our understanding of the cosmos, and how the cosmic web holds vital clues to the origins of the universe and the next trillion years that lie ahead.-- ""Publishers Weekly""

As Python continues to grow in popularity, projects are becoming larger and more complex. Many Python developers are now taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn't always straightforward.With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity--and get the most value out of their test suites.Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)Domain-driven design's distinction between entities, value objects, and aggregatesRepository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storageEvents, commands, and the message busCommand-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices

This book carefully defines the technologies involved in web service composition and provides a formal basis for all of the composition approaches and shows the trade-offs among them. By considering web services as a deep formal topic, some surprising results emerge, such as the possibility of eliminating workflows. It examines the immense potential of web services composition for revolutionizing business IT as evidenced by the marketing of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs).The author begins with informal considerations and builds to the formalisms slowly, with easily-understood motivating examples. Chapters examine the importance of semantics for web services and ways to apply semantic technologies. Topics included range from model checking and Golog to WSDL and AI planning. This book is based upon lectures given to economics students and is suitable for business technologist with some computer science background. The reader can delve as deeply into the technologies as desired.

Many designers, policy makers, teachers, and other practitioners are beginning to understand the usefulness of using digital games beyond entertainment. Games have been developed for teaching, recruiting and to collect data to improve search engines. This book examines the fundamentals of designing any game with a serious purpose and provides a way of thinking on how to design one successfully. The reader will be introduced to a design philosophy called ""Triadic Game Design.""; a theory that all games involve three worlds: the worlds of Reality, Meaning, and Play. Each world is affiliated with aspects. A balance needs to be found within and between the three worlds. Such a balance is difficult to achieve, during the design many tensions will arise, forcing designers to make trade-offs. To deal with these tensions and to ensure that the right decisions are made to create a harmonic game, a frame of reference is needed. This is what Triadic Game Design offers.

When most people go to the airport, they may notice that every airplane looks the same, and the way that airplanes look - and what they can do - hasn't really changed since the 1950s. A natural conclusion is that designing airplanes is not very interesting and does not require much creativity. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Around the world, engineers and scientists and academics - and inventors in their garages - are creating airplanes that implement bold new concepts that will shape the airplanes of the future. A book for kids of all ages, showing the latest, most creative, and most innovative ideas in the field of airplane design. The book is full of large, exciting pictures of exotic, unusual, and futuristic airplanes. The innovative technologies in each airplane is explained in simple language. The concepts shown in this book are currently being tested and figured out. If the reader becomes an engineer in 10 or 20 years, they will use these new ideas - and their creativity! - to make the airplanes of the future better than those of today. The goal of the book is to get kids interested in an area of STEM that is growing very quickly: Every year, new designs are unveiled for drones, reusable spacecraft, ""flying cars"", electric or solar aircraft, futuristic airliners, and airplanes that can fly at extreme speeds and altitudes - or that can hover, and take off and land straight up and down like a helicopter. Younger kids will enjoy the pictures while having the text read to them. Older kids can use the book as a springboard for research into the many other innovative aircraft mentioned along the ones shown in the photos, to learn some of the fundamentals of aeronautical engineering. The book was written by a Boeing airplane designer who consulted with many people involved in unusual and innovative aircraft: The experts developing a Mach 5 airliner that can fly at the edge of space, the engineers who designed the world's most fuel-efficient helicopter (which can fly for 24 hours nonstop), the leaders of the organization that created one of the fastest jets in history, NASA researchers who work on the next generation of electric airplanes, flight instructors whose airplanes are the first to include amazing new safety features, and inventors who build futuristic airplanes in their garages and then fly them! The book illustrates these concepts by showing and explaining patents by Boeing and Airbus, futuristic concepts by NASA and Lockheed, record-breaking airplanes by Scaled Composites, research projects at universities, and photos of the latest experimental proof-of-concept airplanes doing things that no other airplane had ever done before!

Master's Thesis from the year 2020 in the subject Engineering - Automotive Engineering, Jimma University College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, language: English, abstract: To improve the road handling and passenger comfort of a vehicle, a suspension system is provided. An active suspension system is considered to be better than the passive suspension system. In this thesis, 2 degrees of freedom of a linear quarter car active suspension system is designed, which is subject to different disturbances on the road. Since the parametric uncertainty in the spring, the shock absorber, mass and the actuator has been considered, robust control is used. In this thesis, H∞ and 繕- synthesis controllers are used to improve the driving comfort and the ability to drive the car on the road. For the analysis of the time domain, using a MATLAB script program and performed a test using four disturbance inputs of the road (bump, random, sinusoidal and harmonic) for the suspension deflection, the acceleration of the body and the body travel for the active suspension with the H∞ controller and active suspension with 繕- synthesis controller and the comparative simulation and reference results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented active suspension system with 繕- synthesis controller. In addition, in this thesis, comparison have been made between the active suspension system with 繕-synthesis controller and 5 different robust controller for suspension deflection, body acceleration and body travel tests using bump, random, sinusoidal pavements and harmonic road disturbances. Body accelerations comparison of the active suspension system with 繕-synthesis controller with VW (Volkswagen) Passat B5 passenger car is done for a bump road input disturbance and the result shows that there is a 50% reduction in body acceleration for the active suspension system with 繕- synthesis controller.

This exploitation of possibility theory improves upon probability theory, complements Dempster-Shafer theory, and fills an important gap in this era of Big Data and Internet of Things.The book discusses fundamental possibilistic concepts: distribution, necessity measure, possibility measure, joint distribution, conditioning, distances, similarity measures, possibilistic decisions, fuzzy sets, fuzzy measures and integrals, and finally, the interrelated theories of uncertainty..uncertainty. These topics form an essential tour of the mathematical tools needed for the latter chapters of the book. These chapters present applications related to decision-making and pattern recognition schemes, and finally, a concluding chapter on the use of possibility theory in the overall challenging design of an information fusion system. This book will appeal to researchers and professionals in the field of information fusion and analytics, information and knowledge processing, smart ICT, and decision support systems.

This text provides a comprehensive introduction to the use of frequency domain and polynomial system design techniques for a range of industrial control and signal processing applications. The solution of stochastic and robust optimal control problems is considered, building up from simple single-input problems and gradually developing the results for multivariable design of the later chapters. In addition to cataloguing many of the results in polynomial systems needed to calculate industrial controllers and filters, basic design procedures are also introduced which enable cost functions and system descriptions to be specified so that industrial requirements are satisfied. New material in this edition includes the analysis of multi-degrees of freedom controllers and time-varying control and signal processing problems, plus an extension of the linear system concepts to the control of non-linear processes using both multiple model concepts and the link to time-varying optimal control solutions.

This thesis proposes new power converter topologies suitable for aircraft systems. It also proposes both AC-DC and DC-DC types of converters for different electrical loads to improve the performance these systems. To increase fuel efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, less efficient non-electrical aircraft systems are being replaced by electrical systems. However, more electrical systems requires more electrical power to be generated in the aircraft. The increased consumption of electrical power in both civil and military aircrafts has necessitated the use of more efficient electrical power conversion technologies. This book presents acomprehensive mathematical analysis and the design and digital simulation of the power converters. Subsequently it discusses the construction of the hardware prototypes of each converter and the experimental tests carried out to verify the benefits of the proposed solutions in comparison to the existing solutions.

Top-Down Design of Disordered Photonic Structures,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109276773?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=47,"Sunkyu,Yu",Springer    ,9789811375262.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5262/9789811375262.jpg,"

This book introduces recent advances in the deterministic design of photonic structures, which overcome the current limitation in conventional disordered materials. It develops new concepts for disordered photonics inspired by notions in quantum mechanics, solid-state physics, mathematics and network theory, such as isospectrality, supersymmetry, graph network, small-world, de Broglie-Bohm theory, and parity-time symmetry.The multidisciplinary approach based on the core concepts of isospectrality (Chapter 2) and metadisorder (Chapter 3) offers a new perspective on the design methodology in photonics and in general disordered structures toward top-down designs of future photonic applications: perfect bandgap with strong modal localization, switching of random waves for binary and fuzzy logics, photonic analogy of graph networks, interdimensional signal transport, robust wave functions in disordered structures, and a novel method of energy storage and phase trapping based on Bohmian photonics. This book will provide new design criteria for physicists and engineers in photonics, and inspirations for researchers in other fields.

See how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) combines with Jakarta EE MicroProfile or Spring Boot to offer a complete suite for building enterprise-grade applications. In this book you will see how these all come together in one of the most efficient ways to develop complex software, with a particular focus on the DDD process. Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java starts by building out the Cargo Tracker reference application as a monolithic application using the Jakarta EE platform. By doing so, you will map concepts of DDD (bounded contexts, language, and aggregates) to the corresponding available tools (CDI, JAX-RS, and JPA) within the Jakarta EE platform. Once you have completed the monolithic application, you will walk through the complete conversion of the monolith to a microservices-based architecture, again mapping the concepts of DDD and the corresponding available tools within the MicroProfile platform (config, discovery, and fault tolerance). To finish this section, you will examine the same microservices architecture on the Spring Boot platform. The final set of chapters looks at what the application would be like if you used the CQRS and event sourcing patterns. Here you'll use the Axon framework as the base framework. What You Will LearnDiscover the DDD architectural principles and use the DDD design patternsUse the new Eclipse Jakarta EE platform Work with the Spring Boot frameworkImplement microservices design patterns, including context mapping, logic design, entities, integration, testing, and securityCarry out event sourcingApply CQRS Who This Book Is ForJunior developers intending to start working on enterprise Java; senior developers transitioning from monolithic- to microservices-based architectures; and architects transitioning to a DDD philosophy of building applications.

Early approaches to accelerated testing were based on the assumption that there was a simple acceleration factor that would correspond to a linear scaling of time from the operating stress to the accelerating stress. This corresponds to the simplest physical model of the kinetics governing the underlying degradation, but this simple model does not always hold. We need to understand what more complex physical models may look like. Design & Analysis of Accelerated Tests for Mission Critical Reliability presents innovative theory and methods for recognizing and handling the more complicated, cases often encountered in practice. The theory integrates a physical understanding of underlying phenomena and the statistical modeling of observation noise to provide a single theoretical framework for accelerated testing. The treatment includes general approaches that can be used with various computational software packages and an explicit computing environment in S-PLUS. Source code written by the authors is included and available for download from http: //www.crcpress.com/e_products/downloads. For practitioners, this book provides immediately useable tools. For researchers, it presents intriguing open questions. And for the academic community, numerous worked examples, end-of-chapter exercises, and a format that relegates technical and theoretical details to chapter appendices make this an outstanding supplementary textbook for senior and graduate-level students.

When you receive this information you can ferret through the data and use it in any number of computer programs. The result: solutions to plant design problems that affect the health and well being of people around the globe. What does that mean to you, the environmental professional, scientist, or engineer? Computer Simulated Plant Design for Waste Minimization/Pollution Prevention builds on the concepts introduced in Stan Bumble's Computer Generated Physical Properties, the first volume of the Computer Modeling for Environmental Management series. Bumble discusses using computer simulation programs to solve problems in plant design before they occur. He covers design issues for stationary and non-stationary sources of pollution, global warming, troposcopic ozone, and stratospheric ozone. With Computer Simulated Plant Design for Waste Minimization/Pollution Prevention you will understand how to use computer technology to design plants that generate little or no pollution. Even better, you can use the information generated by computer simulation for technical data in proposals, presentations and as the basis for making policy decisions.

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. With this second edition of Software Design for Resilient Computer Systems the book is thoroughly updated to contain the newest advice regarding software resilience. With additional chapters on computer system performance and system resilience, as well as online resources, the new edition is ideal for researchers and industry professionals.The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. Due to the wide reaching nature of the content, this book applies to a host of industries and research areas, including military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, and space exploration.

This book describes the fundamentals and applications of wireless power transfer (WPT) in electric vehicles (EVs). Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a technology that allows devices to be powered without having to be connected to the electrical grid by a cable. Electric vehicles can greatly benefit from WPT, as it does away with the need for users to manually recharge the vehicles' batteries, leading to safer charging operations. Some wireless chargers are available already, and research is underway to develop even more efficient and practical chargers for EVs. This book brings readers up to date on the state-of-the-art worldwide. In particular, it provides: -The fundamental principles of WPT for the wireless charging of electric vehicles (car, bicycles and drones), including compensation topologies, bi-directionality and coil topologies. -Information on international standards for EV wireless charging. -Design procedures for EV wireless chargers, including software files to help readers test their own designs. -Guidelines on the components and materials for EV wireless chargers. -Review and analysis of the main control algorithms applied to EV wireless chargers. -Review and analysis of commercial EV wireless charger products coming to the market and the main research projects on this topic being carried out worldwide.

 This book presents a comprehensive introduction to design sensitivity analysis theory as applied to electromagnetic systems. It treats the subject in a unified manner, providing numerical methods and design examples. The specific focus is on continuum design sensitivity analysis, which offers significant advantages over discrete design sensitivity methods. Continuum design sensitivity formulas are derived from the material derivative in continuum mechanics and the variational form of the governing equation. Continuum sensitivity analysis is applied to Maxwell equations of electrostatic, magnetostatic and eddy-current systems, and then the sensitivity formulas for each system are derived in a closed form; an integration along the design interface.The book also introduces the recent breakthrough of the topology optimization method, which is accomplished by coupling the level set method and continuum design sensitivity. This topology optimization method enhances the possibility of the global minimum with minimised computational time, and in addition the evolving shapes during the iterative design process are easily captured in the level set equation. Moreover, since the optimization algorithm is transformed into a well-known transient analysis algorithm for differential equations, its numerical implementation becomes very simple and convenient. Despite the complex derivation processes and mathematical expressions, the obtained sensitivity formulas are very straightforward for numerical implementation. This book provides detailed explanation of the background theory and the derivation process, which will help readers understand the design method and will set the foundation for advanced research in the future.

Formal Verification of Floating-Point Hardware Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108614825?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=48,"David M,Russinoff",Springer    ,9783030070489.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/0489/9783030070489.jpg,"

This is the first book to focus on the problem of ensuring the correctness of floating-point hardware designs through mathematical methods. Formal Verification of Floating-Point Hardware Design advances a verification methodology based on a unified theory of register-transfer logic and floating-point arithmetic that has been developed and applied to the formal verification of commercial floating-point units over the course of more than two decades, during which the author was employed by several major microprocessor design companies.  The book consists of five parts, the first two of which present a rigorous exposition of the general theory based on the first principles of arithmetic. Part I covers bit vectors and the bit manipulation primitives, integer and fixed-point encodings, and bit-wise logical operations. Part II addresses the properties of floating-point numbers, the formats in which they are encoded as bit vectors, and the various modes of floating-point rounding. In Part III, the theory is extended to the analysis of several algorithms and optimization techniques that are commonly used in commercial implementations of elementary arithmetic operations. As a basis for the formal verification of such implementations, Part IV contains high-level specifications of correctness of the basic arithmetic instructions of several major industry-standard floating-point architectures, including all details pertaining to the handling of exceptional conditions. Part V illustrates the methodology, applying the preceding theory to the comprehensive verification of a state-of-the-art commercial floating-point unit. All of these results have been formalized in the logic of the ACL2 theorem prover and mechanically checked to ensure their correctness. They are presented here, however, in simple conventional mathematical notation. The book presupposes no familiarity with ACL2, logic design, or any mathematics beyond basic high school algebra. It will be of interest to verification engineers as well as arithmetic circuit designers who appreciate the value of a rigorous approach to their art, and is suitable as a graduate text in computer arithmetic.

This book reveals how a generative design process capitalizes on understanding humans in context to deliver appropriate innovation. A repertoire of design actions and output allows designers to work dynamically in order to create a cascade of new ideas and insights. The Design Matrix, a visual team tool, provides a prescriptive and descriptive guide enabling a range of users to work through a problem and also reflect on past decisions. Several case studies from prior industry collaborative projects show the complexities and tensions that can be tackled through the design process and matrix.Case studies include design and engineering development and production of an 8 Tesla MRI, biomedical projects, medical devices, and consumer products. Other cases with Ford Motor Company and Cognizant Technologies illustrate how using a human-centered design process can shift the business paradigm for new products, services, systems, and social innovations. Each story shows different and distinct aspects that span classic design and engineering problem solving to generative contextual processes which lead to innovative solutions. Describes a studio-based product development pedagogy so readers can understand through past examples how to operationalize their own design, engineering, and innovation processes;Provides specific stories that showcase details of the project work, the contextual insights, and proposed solutions as a result of applying tangible visualizations, collaborative work methods, and framing and reframing of the problem;Uses case studies to demonstrate how to use divergent and convergent design thinking and actions from multiple stages of the design process so this can lead to critical team integration and new contextual insights.

The Role of Population Games in the Design of Optimization-Based Controllers,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109190849?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=50,"Julian,Barreiro-Gomez",Springer    ,9783030063849.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3849/9783030063849.jpg,"

This book reports on the implementation of evolutionary-game theory in the design of distributed optimization-based controllers. First, it discusses how the classical population-game approach can contribute to and complement the design of optimization-based controllers. It shows how the features of this approach can be exploited to extend their capabilities in the solution of distributed optimization problems, and examines density games in order to consider multiple coupled constraints and preserve the non-centralized information requirements. Furthermore, it establishes a close relationship between the possible interactions among agents in a population with constrained information sharing among different local controllers. It also discusses coalitional games, focusing on the Shapley power index and proposes an alternative method of computing the latter, which reduces computational time, as well as a different way of finding it using distributed communication structures. All the proposed strategies are then tested on various control problems, such as those related to the Barcelona water supply network, multiple continuous stirred tank reactors, various unmanned aerial vehicle systems, and a water distribution system. This thesis, examined at the Universitat Polit癡cnica de Catalunya and Universidad de los Andes in 2017, received the award for best thesis in control from the control group of the Spanish Committee of Automatic Control (CEA) in the same year.

Rethinking Platinum Anticancer Drug Design: Towards Targeted and Immuno-Chemotherapeutic Approaches,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109286030?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=50,"Daniel Yuan Qiang,Wong",Springer    ,9789811341946.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1946/9789811341946.jpg,"

This thesis describes the authors' pioneering efforts in the conceptualization and implementation of combined platinum-based immuno-chemotherapeutics, which represent a significant paradigm shift from the conventional approach of directly targeting cancer. The work described has opened up a rich and largely unexplored area for platinum-based drug design, and ultimately paves the way for superior immuno-chemotherapeutics with better clinical outcome for patients. Historically, the contribution of the immune system to chemotherapy outcomes has been neglected, as anticancer drugs were believed to be immunosuppressive. However, this has been challenged by contemporary evidence suggesting that many chemotherapeutics, including platinum-based agents, stimulate the innate and/or adaptive immune system and that these ""secret allies"" contribute tangibly to clinical outcomes. A multi-pronged immuno-chemotherapeutic approach not only shrinks tumors, but more importantly, reactivate dormant immune responses to malignancies, eliminating residual cancer cells.

The contributions in this book discuss large-scale problems like the optimal design of domes, antennas, transmission line towers, barrel vaults and steel frames with different types of limitations such as strength, buckling, displacement and natural frequencies. The authors use a set of definite algorithms for the optimization of all types of structures. They also add a new enhanced version of VPS and information about configuration processes to all chapters. Domes are of special interest to engineers as they enclose a maximum amount of space with a minimum surface and have proven to be very economical in terms of consumption of constructional materials. Antennas and transmission line towers are the one of the most popular structure since these steel lattice towers are inexpensive, strong, light and wind resistant. Architects and engineers choose barrel vaults as viable and often highly suitable forms for covering not only low-cost industrial buildings, warehouses, large-span hangars, indoor sports stadiums, but also large cultural and leisure centers. Steel buildings are preferred in residential as well as commercial buildings due to their high strength and ductility particularly in regions which are prone to earthquakes.

This book presents a new topology of the non-isolated online uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system consisting of 3 components: bridgeless boost rectifier, battery charger/discharger, and an inverter. The online UPS system is considered to be the most preferable UPS due to its high level of power quality and proven reliability against all types of line disturbances and power outages. The new battery charger/discharger reduces the battery bank voltage, which improves performance and reliability, while a new control method for the inverter regulates the output voltage for both linear and nonlinear loads. The proposed USP system shows an efficiency of 94% during battery mode and 92% during the normal mode of operation.

Learn to create seamless designs backed by a responsible understanding of the human mind. This book examines how human behavior can be used to integrate your product design into lifestyle, rather than interrupt it, and make decisions for the good of those that are using your product. Mindful Design introduces the areas of brain science that matter to designers, and passionately explains how those areas affect each human's day-to-day experiences with products and interfaces. You will learn about the neurological aspects and limitations of human vision and perception; about our attachment to harmony and dissonance, such as visual harmony, musical harmony; and about our brain's propensity towards pattern recognition and how we perceive the world cognitively. In the second half of the book you will focus on the practical application of what you have learned, specific to interaction and interface design. Real-world examples are used throughout so that you can really see how design is impacting our everyday digital experience. Design is a responsibility, but not enough designers understand the human mind or the process of thought. This book explores the key factors involved and shows you how to make the right design choices. What You'll Learn Review how attention and distraction work and the cost of attentional switchingUse Gestalt principles to communicate visual groupingEnsure your underlying models make sense to your audienceUse time, progression, and transition to create a compositionCarefully examine controlling behavior through reductionist and behaviorist motivation concepts Apply the theoretical knowledge to practical, mindful application design Who This Book Is For The primary audience for this book is professional designers who wish to learn more about the human mind and how to apply that to their work. The book is also useful for design-focussed product owners and startup founders who wish to apply ethical thinking to a team, or when bootstrapping their products. The secondary audience is design students who are either studying a 'traditional' visual design course, or a UX/interaction design course who have a desire to learn how they might be able to apply mindful design to their early careers. Finally, a tertiary audience for this book would be tutors involved in teaching design, or peripheral, courses who may wish to incorporate its teachings into their lectures, workshops or seminars.

This brief introduces game- and decision-theoretical techniques for the analysis and design of resilient interdependent networks. It unites game and decision theory with network science to lay a system-theoretical foundation for understanding the resiliency of interdependent and heterogeneous network systems. The authors pay particular attention to critical infrastructure systems, such as electric power, water, transportation, and communications. They discuss how infrastructure networks are becoming increasingly interconnected as the integration of Internet of Things devices, and how a single-point failure in one network can propagate to other infrastructures, creating an enormous social and economic impact. The specific topics in the book include:  - static and dynamic meta-network resilience game analysis and design; - optimal control of interdependent epidemics spreading over complex networks; and - applications to secure and resilient design of critical infrastructures. These topics are supported by up-to-date summaries of the authors' recent research findings. The authors then discuss the future challenges and directions in the analysis and design of interdependent networks and explain the role of multi-disciplinary research has in computer science, engineering, public policy, and social sciences fields of study. The brief introduces new application areas in mathematics, economics, and system and control theory, and will be of interest to researchers and practitioners looking for new approaches to assess and mitigate risks in their systems and enhance their network resilience. A Game- and Decision-Theoretic Approach to Resilient Interdependent Network Analysis and Design also has self-contained chapters, which allows for multiple levels of reading by anyone with an interest in game and decision theory and network science.

Observer Design for Nonlinear Systems deals with the design of observers for the large class of nonlinear continuous-time models. It contains a unified overview of a broad range of general designs, including the most recent results and their proofs, such as the homogeneous and nonlinear Luenberger design techniques. The book starts from the observation that most observer designs consist in looking for a reversible change of coordinates transforming the expression of the system dynamics into some specific structures, called normal forms, for which an observer is known. Therefore, the problem of observer design is broken down into three sub-problems: -What are the available normal forms and their associated observers?-Under which conditions can a system be transformed into one of these forms and through which transformation? -How can an inverse transformation that recovers an estimate in the given initial coordinates be achieved? This organisation allows the book to structure results within a united framework, highlighting the importance of the choice of the observer coordinates for nonlinear systems. In particular, the first part covers state-affine forms with their Luenberger or Kalman designs, and triangular forms with their homogeneous high-gain designs. The second part addresses the transformation into linear forms through linearization by output injection or in the context of a nonlinear Luenberger design, and into triangular forms under the well-known uniform and differential observability assumptions. Finally, the third part presents some recently developed methods for avoiding the numerically challenging inversion of the transformation. Observer Design for Nonlinear Systems addresses students and researchers looking for an introduction to or an overview of the state of the art in observer design for nonlinear continuous-time dynamical systems. The book gathers the most important results focusing on a large and diffuse literature on general observer designs with global convergence, and is a valuable source of information for academics and practitioners.

Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108633721?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=51,"Brock J,Lameres",Springer    ,9783030136048.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6048/9783030136048.jpg,"

This textbook for courses in Digital Systems Design introduces students to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. Coverage includes both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). Using this textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach, but they have a broad foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the presentation with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the student should be able to ""do"" after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure student performance on each outcome.

This textbook is intended for engineering students taking courses in power electronics, renewable energy sources, smart grids or static power converters. It is also appropriate for students preparing a capstone project where they need to understand, model, supply, control and specify the grid side power converters. The main goal of the book is developing in students the skills that are required to design, control and use static power converters that serve as an interface between the ac grid and renewable power sources. The same skills can be used to design, control and use the static power converters used within the micro-grids and nano-grids, as the converters that provide the interface between such grids and the external grid. The author's approach starts with basic functionality and the role of grid connected power converters in their typical applications, and their static and dynamic characteristics. Particular effort is dedicated to developing simple, concise, intuitive and easy-to-use mathematical models that summarize the essence of the grid side converter dynamics. Mathematics is reduced to a necessary minimum, solved examples are used extensively to introduce new concepts, and exercises are used to test mastery of new skills.

Get a grounding in polymorphism and other fundamental aspects of object-oriented program design and implementation, and learn a subset of design patterns that any practicing Java professional simply must know in today's job climate. Java Program Design presents program design principles to help practicing programmers up their game and remain relevant in the face of changing trends and an evolving language. The book enhances the traditional design patterns with Java's new functional programming features, such as functional interfaces and lambda expressions. The result is a fresh treatment of design patterns that expands their power and applicability, and reflects current best practice. The book examines some well-designed classes from the Java class library, using them to illustrate the various object-oriented principles and patterns under discussion. Not only does this approach provide good, practical examples, but you will learn useful library classes you might not otherwise know about.The design of a simplified banking program is introduced in chapter 1 in a non-object-oriented incarnation and the example is carried through all chapters. You can see the object orientation develop as various design principles are progressively applied throughout the book to produce a refined, fully object-oriented version of the program in the final chapter. What You'll LearnCreate well-designed programs, and identify and improve poorly-designed onesBuild a professional-level understanding of polymorphism and its use in Java interfaces and class hierarchiesApply classic design patterns to Java programming problems while respecting the modern features of the Java languageTake advantage of classes from the Java library to facilitate the implementation of design patterns in your programsWho This Book Is ForJava programmers who are comfortable writing non-object-oriented code and want a guided immersion into the world of object-oriented Java, and intermediate programmers interested in strengthening their foundational knowledge and taking their object-oriented skills to the next level. Even advanced programmers will discover interesting examples and insights in each chapter.

MEMS are rapidly moving from the research laboratory to the mar- ketplace. Many market studies indicate not only a tremendous market potential of MEMS devices; year by year we see the actual market grow as the technology matures. In fact, these days, many large silicon foundries have a MEMS group exploring this promising technology, including such giants as INTEL and Motorola. Yet MEMS are fundamentally different from microelectronics. This means that companies with an established track record in these branches need to adapt their skills, whereas companies that want to enter the ""miniaturization"" market need to establish an entirely new set of capabil- ities. The same can be said of engineers with classical training, who will also need to be educated toward their future professional activity in the MEMS field. Here are some questions that a company or technologist may ask: I have an existing product with miniaturization market poten- tial. Which technology should I adopt? What are the manufacturing options available for miniaturiza- tion? What are the qualitative differences? How do we maintainamarketleadforproductsbased onMEMS? Is there CAD support?Can we outsource manufacturing? Which skills in our current capability need only adaptation? What skills need to be added? Professors Jan Korvink and Oliver Paul have set out to answer these questions in a form that addresses the needs of companies, commercial practitioners, and technologists.

Mobile web use overtook desktop use in 2016, with the rise in the former doubling the fall in the latter. This increase in mobile traffic has made mobile user experience one of the most important factors in the success of a product or website. Providing great user experience is essential from the first second. More than 60% of users will not return to a mobile site that they had trouble accessing, and this means that content, navigation and visual design elements must be twice as intuitive as they are on a desktop. In the face of these trends, designers must constantly keep in mind the point that little screens have very little room for error. Interactive Design for Screen is the result of extensive research centred on the latest designs optimized for the screens of mobile devices. Over a hundred projects appear in this volume, and they showcase the functionality and accessibility of great mobile user interfaces. The designers featured analyse their projects from a variety of perspectives such as product specifications, site purpose and target users, making Interactive Design for Screen a highly practical and inspiring guide for students and designers who know that a great mobile user experience is nothing less than essential. It includes QR codes in each project that link to the behance page to let readers see the interactive effect of the project.

This book introduces readers to various types of offshore platform geometries. It addresses the various environmental loads encountered by these structures, and provides detailed descriptions of the fundamentals of structural dynamics in a classroom style, helping readers estimate damping in offshore structures and grasp these aspects' applications in preliminary analysis and design. Basic concepts of structural dynamics are emphasized through simple illustrative examples and exercises. Design methodologies and guidelines, which are FORM based concepts, are explained through a selection of applied sample structures. Each chapter also features tutorials and exercises for self-learning. A dedicated chapter on stochastic dynamics helps students to extend the basic concepts of structural dynamics to this advanced domain of research. Hydrodynamic response of offshore structures with perforated members is one of the most recent research applications, and has proven to be one of the most effective means of retrofitting offshore structures. In addition, the book integrates the concepts of structural dynamics with the FORM-evolved design of offshore structures, offering a unique approach. This new edition is divided into seven chapters, each of which has been updated. Each chapter also includes a section on frequently asked Questions and Answers (Q&A), which enhances understanding of this complex subject through easy and self-explanatory text. Furthermore, the book presents valuable content with respect to new and recent research carried out by the author in structural dynamics. All numeric examples have been re-checked with more additional explanations. New exercises have been added to improve understanding of the subject matter. Computer coding is also included (wherever possible) to aid computer-based learning of the contents of the book. The book can serve as a textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate courses in civil, structural, applied mechanics, mechanical, aerospace, naval architecture and ocean engineering programs. The book can also serve as a text for professional learning and development programs or as a guide for practicing and consulting offshore structural engineers. The contents of this book will be useful to graduate students, researchers, and professionals alike.

Design of Low-Power Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108175150?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=52,"Yoonjin,Kim",Ingram      ,9781138113527.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3527/9781138113527.jpg,"

Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) has emerged as a solution for flexible, application-specific optimization of embedded systems. Helping you understand the issues involved in designing and constructing embedded systems, Design of Low-Power Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures offers new frameworks for optimizing the architecture of components in embedded systems in order to decrease area and save power. Real application benchmarks and gate-level simulations substantiate these frameworks.The first half of the book explains how to reduce power in the configuration cache. The authors present a low-power reconfiguration technique based on reusable context pipelining that merges the concept of context reuse into context pipelining. They also propose dynamic context compression capable of supporting required bits of the context words set to enable and the redundant bits set to disable. In addition, they discuss dynamic context management for reducing power consumption in the configuration cache by controlling a read/write operation of the redundant context words.Focusing on the design of a cost-effective processing element array to reduce area and power consumption, the second half of the text presents a cost-effective array fabric that uniquely rearranges processing elements and their interconnection designs. The book also describes hierarchical reconfigurable computing arrays consisting of two reconfigurable computing blocks with two types of communication structure. The two computing blocks share critical resources, offering an efficient communication interface between them and reducing the overall area. The final chapter takes an integrated approach to optimization that draws on the design schemes presented in earlier chapters. Using a case study, the authors demonstrate the synergy effect of combining multiple design schemes.

This book describes the modelling and optimisation of vibration reduction systems in an integrated fashion using nonlinear equations of motion. It proposes an effective optimisation method for determining the basic characteristics of the non-linear visco-elastic elements used in passive vibration reduction systems. In the case of semi-active and active vibration isolators, a design process of the advanced control systems is proposed that makes possible to optimise the controller settings relatively to the selected vibro-isolation criteria. The approach developed here is subsequently tested by means of experimental investigations conducted on various sample vibration reduction systems: passive, semi-active and active. The book presents a biomechanical modelling approach that allows users to select the properties of vibro-isolation systems for different types of oscillation and different optimisation criteria - and can significantly reduce the harmful vibrations that can affect the human body in the process. Further, the book equips readers to evaluate the viscoelastic characteristics of passive systems and design control systems for semi-active and active systems.   Modelling and Control Design of Vibration Reduction Systems offers a valuable guide for researchers and practitioners alike. It also provides students and academics with systematic information on the procedures to be followed in the design process for semi-active or active vibration reduction systems.

This book addresses the question of how system software should be designed to account for faults, and which fault tolerance features it should provide for highest reliability. The authors first show how the system software interacts with the hardware to tolerate faults. They analyze and further develop the theory of fault tolerance to understand the different ways to increase the reliability of a system, with special attention on the role of system software in this process. They further develop the general algorithm of fault tolerance (GAFT) with its three main processes: hardware checking, preparation for recovery, and the recovery procedure. For each of the three processes, they analyze the requirements and properties theoretically and give possible implementation scenarios and system software support required. Based on the theoretical results, the authors derive an Oberon-based programming language with direct support of the three processes of GAFT. In the last part of this book, they introduce a simulator, using it as a proof of concept implementation of a novel fault tolerant processor architecture (ERRIC) and its newly developed runtime system feature-wise and performance-wise. The content applies to industries such as military, aviation, intensive health care, industrial control, space exploration, etc.

Wideband Circuit Design starts at a foundational level and proceeds at a carefully gauged pace to advanced topics, providing a self-sufficient text for specialization in wideband analog circuit design for the fields of telecommunications and related areas. Basic theory and comprehensive circuit analysis methods (oriented for application to general network computer programs) are detailed and then extended to applicational topics such as filters, delay structures, equalizers, matching networks, broadband amplifiers, and microwave components.Novel and simplified approaches to such fundamental topics as linear circuit time domain response, synthesis of cascaded networks, and the construction of Chebychev and elliptic transfer functions are given. For the first time in book form a unified presentation of analytic matching and gain-bandwidth theory, integrated with the numerical Real Frequency design technique (originally published by the authors), is delineated. Wideband Circuit Design presents all the concepts, techniques, and procedures you need to gain the broad understanding necessary for finding creative solutions to wideband circuit design problems.

This book demonstrates the implementation of an automated measuring system for very efficient measurement of chromatic dispersion, which uses a modulation phase shift method over long haul of optical single mode fiber. The authors show how a new scheme for measuring chromatic dispersion is adopted in conjunction with a tunable laser (TLS), providing the optical power at required wavelength and digital oscilloscope (DOSC) for measuring the phase difference between microwave signals from transmitter and microwave signals at the receiver. This is a novel approach for real-time chromatic dispersion in optical systems such as optical fibers. The setup used is very simple, accurate and cost effective, compared to other methods such as direct measurement, differential mode delay, polarization mode dispersion measurement and phase delay method.

In recent years both free-standing and geometric staircases have become quite popular. Many variations exist, such as spiral, helical, and elliptical staircases, and combinations of these. A number of researchers have come forward with different concepts in the fields of analytical and numerical design and of experimental methods and assessments. The aim of this book is to cover all these methods and to present them with greater simplicity to practising engineers.Staircases is divided into five chapters: Specifications and basic data on staircases; Structural analysis of staircases - Classical methods; Structural analysis of staircases - Modern methods; Staircases and their analysis - A comparative study; Design analysis and structural detailing. Charts and graphs are included and numerous design examples are given of freestanding and other geometric staircases and of their elements and components. These examples are related to the case studies which were based on staircases that have already been constructed. All examples are checked using various Eurocodes.The book includes bibliographical references and is supported by two appendices, which will be of particular interest to those practising engineers who wish to make a comparative study of the different practices and code requirements used by various countries; detailed drawings are included from the USA, Britain, Europe and Asia. Staircases will serve as a useful text for teachers preparing design syllabi for undergraduate and post graduate courses. Each major section contains a full explanation which allows the book to be used by students and practising engineers, particularly those facing the formidable task of having to design/ detail complicated staircases with unusual boundary conditions. Contractors will also find this book useful in the preparation of construction drawings and manufacturers will be interested in the guidance given in the text.

Design and Control of Highly Conductive Single-Molecule Junctions,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108704289?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=54,"Satoshi,Kaneko",Springer    ,9789811351297.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1297/9789811351297.jpg,"

This thesis describes improvements to and control of the electrical conductance in single-molecule junctions (SMJs), which have potential applications in molecular electronics, with a focus on the bonding between the metal and molecule. In order to improve the electrical conductance, the π orbital of the molecule is directly bonded to the metal orbital, because anchoring groups, which were typically used in other studies to bind molecule with metal electrodes, became resistive spacers. Using this direct π-binding, the author has successfully demonstrated highly conductive SMJs involving benzene, endohedral metallofullerene Ce@C82, and nitrogen. Subsequently, the author investigated control of the electrical conductance of SMJs using pyrazine. The nitrogen atom in the π-conjugated system of pyrazine was expected to function as an anchoring point, and two bonding states were expected. One originates primarily from the π orbital, while the other originates primarily from an n state of the nitrogen. Measurements of conductance and dI/dV spectra coupled with theoretical calculations revealed that the pyrazine SMJ has bistable conductance states, in which the pyrazine axis is either tilted or parallel with respect to the junction axis. The bistable states were switched by changing the gap size between the metal electrodes using an external force. Notably, it is difficult to change the electrical properties of bulk-state materials using mechanical force. The findings reveal that the electron transport properties of a SMJ can be controlled by designing a proper metal-molecule interface, which has considerable potential for molecular electronics. Moreover, this thesis will serve as a guideline for every step of SMJ research: design, fabrication, evaluation, and control.

Providing a wide variety of technologies for ensuring the safety and dependability of cyber-physical systems (CPS), this book offers a comprehensive introduction to the architecture-centric modeling, analysis, and verification of CPS. In particular, it focuses on model driven engineering methods including architecture description languages, virtual prototyping, and formal analysis methods. CPS are based on a new design paradigm intended to enable emerging software-intensive systems. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with the help of feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The principal challenges in system design lie in this constant interaction of software, hardware and physics. Developing reliable CPS has become a critical issue for the industry and society, because many applications such as transportation, power distribution, medical equipment and tele-medicine are dependent on CPS. Safety and security requirements must be ensured by means of powerful validation tools. Satisfying such requirements, including quality of service, implies having formally proven the required properties of the system before it is deployed. The book is concerned with internationally standardized modeling languages such as AADL, SysML, and MARTE. As the effectiveness of the technologies is demonstrated with industrial sample cases from the automotive and aerospace sectors, links between the methods presented and industrial problems are clearly understandable. Each chapter is self-contained, addressing specific scientific or engineering problems, and identifying further issues. In closing, it includes perspectives on future directions in CPS design from an architecture analysis viewpoint.

Unlike other books on the modeling and analysis of experimental data, Design and Analysis of Experiments: Classical and Regression Approaches with SAS not only covers classical experimental design theory, it also explores regression approaches. Capitalizing on the availability of cutting-edge software, the author uses both manual methods and SAS programs to carry out analyses.The book presents most of the different designs covered in a typical experimental design course. It discusses the requirements for good experimentation, the completely randomized design, the use of orthogonal contrast to test hypotheses, and the model adequacy check. With an emphasis on two-factor factorial experiments, the author analyzes repeated measures as well as fixed, random, and mixed effects models. He also describes designs with randomization restrictions, before delving into the special cases of the 2k and 3k factorial designs, including fractional replication and confounding. In addition, the book covers response surfaces, balanced incomplete block and hierarchical designs, ANOVA, ANCOVA, and MANOVA. Fortifying the theory and computations with practical exercises and supplemental material, this distinctive text provides a modern, comprehensive treatment of experimental design and analysis.

The ergonomics focus is on how to design work tasks, tools, and environments to fit the capabilities and limitations of people. Ergonomic Design for Material Handling Systems describes how ergonomics can be applied specifically to load handling, both in the original design of systems and in their modification to make jobs easier and safer. Proven techniques (such as flow charting, or job analysis) are combined with new considerations (such as biomechanics and repetitive trauma) to optimize facility, work station, equipment, and job procedures.Ergonomic Design for Material Handling Systems shows how ergonomics overlaps and intertwines with traditional engineering and management, uniting them to produce ease and efficiency in material handling. This book demonstrates how to lay out facilities in order to achieve the most efficient and safe design. It tells how to organize tasks, machinery, people, and materials to improve work flow and humanize your workplaces. Consideration of human needs and abilities contributes essentially to successful performance-let this practical book be your guide.

ThoughtWorks高級諮詢師最新力作
學習輕量級、最新的Web開發方法


	輕量級Web開發是一個很廣的主題，開發人員經常提到，但卻少有人能夠講明它的內涵。

	好的程式設計師 就是從基礎開始，作業系統、工具、開發環境、程式語言、測試架構、資料庫、雲端平台等，如果都做到了輕量級，整個程式自然就執行飛快，測試容易，錯誤變少，維護方便。

	本書將教會你如何將一個想法變成實際的Web應用。從高效的程式設計工具、開發流程，到敏捷開發中的各種輕量級實踐，再從零開始開發一個具體而微的實例。

	■ 使用Mac OS作為開發作業系統：既能享受Windows的方便，又是原生UNIX。
	■ 用zsh取代bash，少打很多字，少用很多cd到處找。
	■ 用vim不用普通的文字編輯，所有和文字有關的事，手都不需離開鍵盤。
	■ 用Ruby作為網頁語言，天生的Web DNA，非傳統程式思考方式。
	■ 用Bootstrap/Foundation作為樣式框架，又漂亮又簡單。

	適用：軟體開發人員、對輕量級Web開發感興趣者。

Biomass Supply Chains provides a comprehensive study on the key issues in sustainability and sustainable design of biomass-based fuel and energy systems and supply chains, as well as circular systems for biomass-based production. Economic, environmental, social and technical issues are examined individually at both system/technology and supply chain level, including details on standards and certification schemes. It goes on to explore the methods and tools for sustainability assessment and sustainable design and management, describing each sustainability-related decision level encountered in design, management and operation phases. It also discusses the circular economy concept and explains different analytical tools, industrial engineering and operations research methods to design and manage circular systems. To this aim, the main strategies, methods and tools to create circular systems and to convert traditional linear systems into circular systems are introduced, as well as key waste management and resource use strategies. All issues discussed are illustrated through real-life cases. At the end of each chapter, a discussion and a comparative analysis of their topics is provided.  By integrating all these problematics and challenges in sustainability and circular design, this book allows researchers in academia and industry working on developing biomass-based solutions to clearly identify the methodologies and tools that satisfy their specific sustainability and circularity requirements based on the recent advances and prospects in the field. Graduate students and practitioners can also use this reference as systematic guide to available sustainability assessment methodologies that they can apply to biomass and bioenergy technologies.

Get hands-on experience with each Gang of Four design pattern using C#. For each of the patterns, you'll see at least one real-world scenario, a coding example, and a complete implementation including output.In the first part of Design Patterns in C#, you will cover the 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, before moving onto some alternative design patterns, including the Simple Factory Pattern, the Null Object Pattern, and the MVC Pattern. The final part winds up with a conclusion and criticisms of design patterns with chapters on anti-patterns and memory leaks. By working through easy-to-follow examples, you will understand the concepts in depth and have a collection of programs to port over to your own projects.Along the way, the author discusses the different creational, structural, and behavioral patterns and why such classifications are useful.

Doctoral Thesis / Dissertation from the year 2016 in the subject Computer Science - IT-Security, grade: 4, The University of Memphis, language: English, abstract: This dissertation proposes two models for designing robust networks against intelligent attackers. In both models, three stakeholders are considered: the network manager/designer, the adversary (intelligent attacker), and the network users. The frameworks of both models and some other possible models are presented in this dissertation. The first framework is a bi-objective designer model. The designer in this model has two objectives at the top level: to reduce the total system cost and to reduce the vulnerability of the network. The Sioux Falls network consists of 24 nodes and 76 links was chosen for to evaluate this framework. The decision of the designer and attacker was improving or destroying the links. Metaheuristic algorithm was used to solve the designer and attacker problems. For the user equilibrium problem, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm was implemented. The objective of the designer of the network in the first model, consist of two goals. The two goals may conflict on the amount of amount of limited available budget to be invested on the desired project/links. Therefore, a trade off solutions between these two objectives may forms. The results proved that the proposed multi-level model is able to find the Pareto front solutions for the two objectives of the designer. The second framework is a three-level zero-sum game model. In this framework, the payoffs from the designer are assumed to have the same value to the adversary entity. Therefore, the goal of this framework is to minimize the maximum gain that the adversary can achieve. An example network with 6 nodes and 16 links was used to examine this framework. The results showed that the model could be a valuable tool to reduce the potential vulnerability of networks. Other indicators of system performance can be implemented in the upper-level of

In this thesis, the author makes several contributions to the study of design of graphical materials. The thesis begins with a review of the relationship between design and aesthetics, and the use of mathematical models to capture this relationship. Then, a novel method for linking linguistic concepts to colors using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Dual Topic Model is proposed. Next, the thesis studies the relationship between aesthetics and spatial layout by formalizing the notion of visual balance. Applying principles of salience and Gaussian mixture models over a body of about 120,000 aesthetically rated professional photographs, the author provides confirmation of Arnhem's theory about spatial layout. The thesis concludes with a description of tools to support automatically generating personalized design.

This book examines the possibilities of incorporating elements of user-centred design (UCD) such as user experience (UX) and usability with agile software development. It explores the difficulties and problems inherent in integrating these two practices despite their relative similarities, such as their emphasis on stakeholder collaboration. Developed from a workshop held at NordiCHI in 2014, this edited volume brings together researchers from across the software development, UCD and creative design fields to discuss the current state-of-the-art. Practical case studies of integrating UCD in Agile development across diverse contexts are presented, whilst the different futures for UCD and other design practices in the context of agile software development are identified and explored.  Integrating User Centred Design in Agile Development will be ideal for researchers, designers and academics who are interested in software development, user-centred design, agile methodologies and related areas.

The Design of Active Crossovers,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c803363634?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=58,"Self, Douglas",Focal Pr    ,9781138733022.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3022/9781138733022.jpg,"

The use of active crossovers is increasing. They are used by almost every sound reinforcement system, and by almost every recording studio monitoring set-up. There is also a big usage of active crossovers in car audio, with the emphasis on routing the bass to enormous low-frequency loudspeakers. Active crossovers are used to a small but rapidly growing extent in domestic hifi, and I argue that their widespread introduction may be the next big step in this field.  The Design of Active Crossovers has now been updated and extended for the Second Edition, taking in developments in loudspeaker technology and crossover design. Many more pre-designed filters are included so that crossover development can be faster and more certain, and the result will have a high performance. The Second Edition continues the tradition of the first in avoiding complicated algebra and complex numbers, with the mathematics reduced to the bare minimum; there is nothing more complicated to grapple with than a square root.  New features of the Second Edition include:   ● More on loudspeaker configurations and their crossover requirements:   MTM Mid-Tweeter-Mid configurations (The d'Appolito arrangement)  Line arrays (J arrays) for sound reinforcement  Frequency tapering  Band zoning  Power tapering  Constant-Beamwidth Transducer (CBT) loudspeaker arrays  ● More on specific sound-reinforcement issues like the loss of high frequencies due to the absorption of sound in air and how it varies.  ● Lowpass filters now have their own separate chapter.  Much more on third, fourth, fifth, and sixth-order lowpass filters.

This book presents a case study on a new approach for the optimum design of rooftop, grid-connected photovoltaic-system installation. The study includes two scenarios using different brands of commercially available PV modules and inverters. It investigates and compares several different rooftop grid-connected PV-system configurations taking into account PV modules and inverter specifications. The book also discusses the detailed dynamic MATLAB/Simulink model of the proposed rooftop grid-connected PV system, and uses this model to estimate the energy production capabilities, cost of energy (COE), simple payback time (SPBT) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for each configuration. The book then presents a comprehensive small signal MATLAB/Simulink model for the DC-DC converter operated under continuous conduction mode (CCM). First, the buck converter is modeled using state-space average model and dynamic equations, depicting the converter, are derived. Then a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model utilizing SimElectronics(R) Toolbox is developed. Lastly, the robustness of the converter model is verified against input voltage variations and step load changes.

A gripping first-person account of how scientists came to understand our universe's mysterious structureJ. Richard Gott was among the first cosmologists to propose that the structure of our universe is like a sponge made up of clusters of galaxies intricately connected by filaments of galaxies--a magnificent structure now called the cosmic web and mapped extensively by teams of astronomers. Here is his gripping insider's account of how a generation of undaunted theorists and observers solved the mystery of the architecture of our cosmos.The Cosmic Web begins with modern pioneers of extragalactic astronomy, such as Edwin Hubble and Fritz Zwicky. It goes on to describe how, during the Cold War, the American school of cosmology favored a model of the universe where galaxies resided in isolated clusters, whereas the Soviet school favored a honeycomb pattern of galaxies punctuated by giant, isolated voids. Gott tells the stories of how his own path to a solution began with a high-school science project when he was eighteen, and how he and astronomer Mario Jurič measured the Sloan Great Wall of Galaxies, a filament of galaxies that, at 1.37 billion light-years in length, is one of the largest structures in the universe.Drawing on Gott's own experiences working at the frontiers of science with many of today's leading cosmologists, The Cosmic Web shows how ambitious telescope surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are transforming our understanding of the cosmos, and how the cosmic web holds vital clues to the origins of the universe and the next trillion years that lie ahead.-- ""Publishers Weekly""

The US Food and Drug Administration's Report to the Nation in 2004 and 2005 indicated that one of the top reasons for drug recall was that stability data did not support existing expiration dates. Pharmaceutical companies conduct stability studies to characterize the degradation of drug products and to estimate drug shelf life. Illustrating how stability studies play an important role in drug safety and quality assurance, Statistical Design and Analysis of Stability Studies presents the principles and methodologies in the design and analysis of stability studies.After introducing the basic concepts of stability testing, the book focuses on short-term stability studies and reviews several methods for estimating drug expiration dating periods. It then compares some commonly employed study designs and discusses both fixed and random batch statistical analyses. Following a chapter on the statistical methods for stability analysis under a linear mixed effects model, the book examines stability analyses with discrete responses, multiple components, and frozen drug products. In addition, the author provides statistical methods for dissolution testing and explores current issues and recent developments in stability studies.To ensure the safety of consumers, professionals in the field must carry out stability studies to determine the reliability of drug products during their expiration period. This book provides the material necessary for you to perform stability designs and analyses in pharmaceutical research and development.

Design and Development of Metal-Forming Processes and Products Aided by Finite Element Simulation,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108697701?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=58,"Ming Wang,Fu",Springer    ,9783319835266.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/5266/9783319835266.jpg,"

This book presents state-of-the-art research on forming processes and formed metal product development aided by the Finite Element Method (FEM). Using extensive and informative illustrations, tables and photographs, it systematically presents real-life case studies and established findings regarding various forming processes and methods aided by FEM simulation, and addresses various issues related to metal formed part design, process determination, die design and die service life analysis and prolongation, as well as product quality assurance and improvement. Metal forming has been widely used in many industries. This traditional manufacturing process, however, has long been linked to many years of apprenticeship and skilled craftsmanship, and its conventional design and development paradigm appeared to involve more know-how and trial-and-error than in-depth scientific calculation, analysis and simulation. The design paradigm for forming processes and metal formed product development thus cannot meet the current demands for short development lead-times, low production costs and high product quality. With the advent of numerical simulation technologies, the design and development of forming processes and metal formed products are carried out with the aid of FEM simulation, allowing all the potential design spaces to be identified and evaluated, and the best design to ultimately be determined and implemented. Such a design and development paradigm aims at ensuring ""designing right the first time"" and reducing the need for trial-and-error in the workshop. This book provides postgraduates, manufacturing engineers and professionals in this field with an in-depth understanding of the design process and sufficient knowledge to support metal formed part design, forming process determination, tooling design, and product quality assurance and control via FEM simulation.

This book reports on the implementation of evolutionary-game theory in the design of distributed optimization-based controllers. First, it discusses how the classical population-game approach can contribute to and complement the design of optimization-based controllers. It shows how the features of this approach can be exploited to extend their capabilities in the solution of distributed optimization problems, and examines density games in order to consider multiple coupled constraints and preserve the non-centralized information requirements. Furthermore, it establishes a close relationship between the possible interactions among agents in a population with constrained information sharing among different local controllers. It also discusses coalitional games, focusing on the Shapley power index and proposes an alternative method of computing the latter, which reduces computational time, as well as a different way of finding it using distributed communication structures. All the proposed strategies are then tested on various control problems, such as those related to the Barcelona water supply network, multiple continuous stirred tank reactors, various unmanned aerial vehicle systems, and a water distribution system.

This book covers cutting-edge findings related to uncertainty quantification and optimization under uncertainties (i.e. robust and reliable optimization), with a special emphasis on aeronautics and turbomachinery, although not limited to these fields. It describes new methods for uncertainty quantification, such as non-intrusive polynomial chaos, collocation methods, perturbation methods, as well as adjoint based and multi-level Monte Carlo methods. It includes methods for characterization of most influential uncertainties, as well as formulations for robust and reliable design optimization. A distinctive element of the book is the unique collection of test cases with prescribed uncertainties, which are representative of the current engineering practice of the industrial consortium partners involved in UMRIDA, a level 1 collaborative project within the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). All developed methods are benchmarked against these industrial challenges. Moreover, the book includes a section dedicated to Best Practice Guidelines for uncertainty quantification and robust design optimization, summarizing the findings obtained by the consortium members within the UMRIDA project. All in all, the book offers a authoritative guide to cutting-edge methodologies for uncertainty management in engineering design, covers a wide range of applications and discusses new ideas for future research and interdisciplinary collaborations.

This book presents a new topology of the non-isolated online uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system consisting of 3 components: bridgeless boost rectifier, battery charger/discharger, and an inverter. The online UPS system is considered to be the most preferable UPS due to its high level of power quality and proven reliability against all types of line disturbances and power outages. The new battery charger/discharger reduces the battery bank voltage, which improves performance and reliability, while a new control method for the inverter regulates the output voltage for both linear and nonlinear loads. The proposed USP system shows an efficiency of 94% during battery mode and 92% during the normal mode of operation.

It's no longer enough to make your site easy to learn and use: Web designers need to help their users feel comfortable with every aspect of their site interactions: physical, mental, and emotional. Drawing upon advanced research in psychology and human-computer interfaces -- as well as extensive practical Web design experience -- Albert N. Badre shows precisely how to accomplish this. Badre goes beyond ""mere usability,"" introducing a complete, Web-specialized framework that lets you ""design for context,"" taking into account every aspect of the Web environment. Shaping Web Usability begins by reviewing essential human-computer interaction principles for the Web; then outlines a usability strategy that takes multiple contexts into account: extrinsic design, users, genre, site, and page. Badre offers deep insight into Web users themselves: their skill levels, personalities, and demographics; and presents a full chapter on the unique needs of older Web users. Along the way, he addresses the key issues that make Web usability so challenging, including security and privacy, platform independence, dynamic content, compatibility, and navigation. You'll learn how to ensure that aesthetics and usability complement each other; how to extend usability to handheld devices; and how to evaluate Web usability most effectively. For all Web designers, developers, usability specialists, marketers, and others concerned with the Web user experience.

The approach will be to give visual aid (illustrated) and written reference to young designers who are either launching their careers or taking their first stab at designing letterforms for a logo, lettermark, signage, advertising or an alphabet. The book will focus on the roots of each letterform and give the designers the knowledge of why weight variations (stress) exist and how to correctly apply them to their designs.  Key Features A how-to resource for designers to referencee while designing letterforms. The designer will be left with a clear understanding of why letterforms look the way they do, and the moethod and order of letterform development, enabling the designer to draw on history when developing their glyphs. How-to illustrations will highlight the process and downloadable vectors will give the designer templates to begin their project. This book gives designers a solid footing when designing a series of characters without developing a complete alphabet. Custom typography is a growing trend and every newly minted designer should have a practical knowledge of the origins of letters and the method of building letterforms.

The 5 full papers, 4 technical communications presented together with 4 invited talks were carefully reviewed and selected from 16 submissions. The scale and the heterogenous nature of web data poses many challenges, and turns basic tasks such as query answering and data transformations into complex reasoning problems. Rule-based systems have found many applications in this area. The RR conference welcomes original research from all areas of Web Reasoning and Rule Systems. Topics of particular interest are: answer set programming, complex events, datalog, description logics, event-condition-action rules, information extraction, and logic programming.

．ThoughtWorks高級諮詢師最新力作

．學習輕量級、最新的Web開發方法
	輕量級Web開發是一個很廣的主題，開發人員經常提到，但卻少有人能夠講明它的內涵。

	好的程式設計師 就是從基礎開始，作業系統、工具、開發環境、程式語言、測試架構、資料庫、雲端平台等，如果都做到了輕量級，整個程式自然就執行飛快，測試容易，錯誤變少，維護方便。

	本書將教會你如何將一個想法變成實際的Web應用。從高效的程式設計工具、開發流程，到敏捷開發中的各種輕量級實踐，再從零開始開發一個具體而微的實例。

	■ 使用Mac OS作為開發作業系統：既能享受Windows的方便，又是原生UNIX
	■ 用zsh取代bash，少打很多字，少用很多cd到處找
	■ 用vim不用普通的文字編輯，所有和文字有關的事，手都不需離開鍵盤
	■ 用Ruby作為網頁語言，天生的Web DNA，非傳統程式思考方式
	■ 用Bootstrap/Foundation作為樣式框架，又漂亮又簡單

Until now, there has been a lack of a complete knowledge base to fully comprehend Low power (LP) design and power aware (PA) verification techniques and methodologies and deploy them all together in a real design verification and implementation project. This book is a first approach to establishing a comprehensive PA knowledge base.LP design, PA verification, and Unified Power Format (UPF) or IEEE-1801 power format standards are no longer special features. These technologies and methodologies are now part of industry-standard design, verification, and implementation flows (DVIF). Almost every chip design today incorporates some kind of low power technique either through power management on chip, by dividing the design into different voltage areas and controlling the voltages, through PA dynamic and PA static verification, or their combination.The entire LP design and PA verification process involves thousands of techniques, tools, and methodologies, employed from the register transfer level (RTL) of design abstraction down to the synthesis or place-and-route levels of physical design. These techniques, tools, and methodologies are evolving everyday through the progression of design-verification complexity and more intelligent ways of handling that complexity by engineers, researchers, and corporate engineering policy makers.

Praise for The Complete Website Planning Guide A great, accessible and practical guide that you can quickly use to get better results from your next website build. Get to it!Would you build a house without blueprints and expect it to be perfect?That's how many people go about their web projects, with napkin drawings, spoken discussions, part finished summaries and guides and wonder why it's not finished on time, costs more than it should and people aren't happy with it.You can be the architect of your next website project and avoid delays, scope creep, missing functionality and extra costs.In The Complete Website Planning Guide you can learn how to easily create blueprints (a scope) for your, or your clients, website that will solve many of the key problems that occur in website development projects.After more than 20 years running a design and development agency Darryl still couldn't find a standard way that clients and developers could outline exactly what they needed to get the job done most effectively. Most briefs or planning methods either focus on general things like platform, hosting and general design guidelines. Many agencies or freelancers still fly by the seat of their pants using their experience to guide the project.So he wrote this guidebook as an instruction manual to create useful site plans without missing out important requirements, or needing to be overly technical.In this simple step-by-step guide he walks you through the process of establishing what the website really needs to do and shows you how to do it.If you want to build your next website before you pick a theme and try to wedge your needs into it, before you tell your designer to copy someone else's site read this book and create your website plan.If you are a freelancer or agency developer don't take on a client or quote a new project without helping them plan the site properly.Learn how to create a plan so you can avoid overruns, scope creep and lost money.This is the very first step you need for your next web project, download the free templates and resources, and join the facebook group where you can get advice on working through your own plan.  And now you can also buy the companion Complete Website Planning Guide Workbook to use side by side with this book.What readers said: ""If you are a business owner, read it, print out the templates and have these discussions with your designers. Trust me, even if you do only a few things in this guide, your outcome will be 100% better than if you just choose your site based on the pretty colours."" Ed Pelgen""I am a freelancer and this is what I was looking for. Darryl has used his experience in laying out the problems faced by clients and freelancers and also given some templates and methods to follow before starting a new project"" Amrinder Singh

Although web components are still on the bleeding edge--barely supported in modern browsers--the technology is also moving extremely fast. This practical guide gets you up to speed on the concepts underlying W3C's emerging standard and shows you how to build custom, reusable HTML5 Web Components.Regardless of your experience with libraries such as jQuery and Polymer, this book teaches JavaScript developers the DOM manipulations these libraries perform. You'll learn how to build a basic widget with vanilla JavaScript and then convert it into a web component that's semantic, declarative, encapsulated, consumable, and maintainable. With custom components, the Web can finally fulfill its potential as a natively extensible application platform. This book gets you in at the right time.Understand core concepts (such as normal flow and positioning, and Z-index) for properly positioning, dragging, and resizing elementsExplore UI concepts and patterns typically abstracted away by Dojo, jQuery UI, Kendo UI, and other librariesDive into the W3C standard and convert your working widget example into a fully functioning web componentLearn how to encapsulate, package, and deploy your web components with Google's Polymer framework

U.S. Cruisers,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c004210907?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=64,"Norman,Friedman",US Naval Institute Press,9781682476260.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6260/9781682476260.jpg,"

Like other books in Norman Friedman's design-history series, this one pays attention to all designs, even those that never left the drawing board, since every proposal made is a link in the evolution of the cruiser force. Friedman, a recognized authority on U.S. warships, uncovers the reasoning behind the many radical changes in U.S. cruiser design, which culminated in the series of Aegis missile ships. He deals both with evolving technology and with those changes in the doctrine and role of the U.S. Navy that clearly affected cruiser design, Because the nature of the cruiser is somewhat ill defined, his book discusses a wide variety of ships, from the battleship-like armored cruisers of the turn of the century the battle cruisers of 1916 to scout cruisers and the Atlantas, ships that were, in many ways, enlarged destroyers. It covers the emergence of ""peace cruisers,"" which were essentially large gunboats, and the post-1945 command and missile cruisers. The World War II Alaska-class large cruisers are also included. Friedman shows how the path from the first steel cruisers to the ultramodern Ticonderogas defines many of the themes of U.S. naval development: the transition from a coastal defense/commerce raiding navy to a navy designed to seize and exploit command of the world's oceans, and from a navy of independent cruisers on foreign stations to a battle fleet navy and then a carrier navy. Arms control is another important theme of this book. Friedman explains how cruiser design, much more that the design of any other category of ship, has been affected by the constraints of naval arms limitation treaties. He uses the Erie-class gunboat, a ""slow cruiser,"" and the original Cleveland, an abortive design that stayed within the 8,000-ton limit prescribed by the London Treaty of 1936, as examples of attempts to exploit treaty restrictions. Also carefully examined are the many post-World War II cruiser projects, both those that were built, like the nuclear powered Long Beach, and those that were not, like the specialized command ship of 1968. In every case, the author discusses not merely what was tried, but why it succeeded or failed. A.D. Baker III and Alan Raven have drawn detailed scale outboard and plan views of each cruiser class and of major modifications to many classes. The author has provided inboard profiles and sketches of abortive projects. Numerous photographs complement the text. Appendices include ship characteristics and data on ship careers. U.S. Cruisers is essential reading for those concerned with the future of the U.S. Navy. Naval historians and architects alike will find this the most comprehensive reference available on the subject.

Ever since the introduction of the LEGO MINDSTORMS robotics kit in 1998, there has been a desire to explore all the possibilities of what can be done with it. Along with this desire, many different LEGO robotics competitions emerged as well. Among the most popular today is FIRST LEGO League (FLL). LEGO MINDSTORMS kits have changed considerably over the years, and the current MINDSTORMS NXT system offers an array of new functionality with improved sensors, motors, and programming abilities. For people who have been working with the MINDSTORMS system for many years, these changes have been welcome additions. However, for people new to the world of LEGO robots, things can get overwhelming very quickly. The goal of this book is to help coaches and team members better understand what it takes to build a winning robot for competitive LEGO robotics events. Some knowledge of the LEGO MINDSTORMS system would be helpful prior to using this book. The design principles covered in this book are intended not to be strict guidelines but design foundations to help get teams to the next level of competiveness. Over the years, I have observed that teams typically need a few years of competing before they learn all the helpful tips and tricks that are used by winning teams. With the help of this book, a team should be able to learn some of these steps earlier and use them as a foundation for creating its own winning ideas and designs.

This book describes the design and realization of analog fractional-order circuits, which are suitable for on-chip implementation, capable of low-voltage operation and electronic adjustment of their characteristics. The authors provide a brief introduction to fractional-order calculus, followed by design issues for fractional-order circuits of various orders and types. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated with current-mode and voltage-mode filter designs. Electronically tunable emulators of fractional-order capacitors and inductors are presented, where the behavior of the corresponding chips fabricated using the AMS 0.35um CMOS process has been experimentally verified. Applications of fractional-order circuits are demonstrated, including a pre-processing stage suitable for the implementation of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm for detecting the QRS complexes of an electrocardiogram (ECG), a fully tunable implementation of the Cole-Cole model used for the modeling of biological tissues, and a simple, non-impedance based measuring technique for super-capacitors.

In the last forty years, at least fifty books have been written on the subject of soil mechanics, most of them textbooks. Only a few touch on practical applications. Soil Engineering: Testing, Design, and Remediation supplies the information needed to fill the gap between textbook learning and practical know-how.When engineers deal with major projects, such as the Teton Dam or the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they need high-tech solutions. More often than not, however, they deal with the foundations for warehouses, schools, medium-rise buildings, and residential structures, projects that need low-tech solutions. Ninety percent of the time consulting engineers don't require mathematical treatment or computer analysis, they require experience.Soil engineering problems cannot be resolved with textbook information alone. This book provides the practical meaning of the different aspects of soil mechanics, the use of unconfined compression test data, the meaning of consolidated tests, the practical value of lateral pressure, and more. In addition to the technical aspects of foundation investigation, in the real world the shadow of litigation looms over every consultant's head. The author covers legal issues in detail.After several years in foundation investigation most consultants realize that soil engineering is a combination of art and science. Soil Engineering: Testing, Design and Remediation demystifies this connection and supplies real-world examples of practical applications. This hands-on, ready reference will be essential tool for any consultant working in the field.

With the environment, climate change, and global warming taking center stage in the national debate, the issues seem insurmountable and certainly unsolvable at the local level. Written by Chris Maser, international consultant on forest ecology, sustainable forestry practices, and sustainable development, Social-Environmental Planning: The Design Interface Between Everyforest and Everycity focuses on community based solutions, emphasizing how the heavy lifting of sustainability will always be done inside existing cities and communities. Based on the author's forty years of experience, the book covers the sustainability of the planet and its population when dealing with climate change. The book provides an in-depth understanding of the commonalities of pattern between Everyforest and Everycity. Maser suggests that before changes can be made, society must adapt to the circumstances of global climate change as they already are, and then determine what we can do to stabilize global climate as effectively and quickly as possible. He explores the reciprocal interface between communities and the landscape and how, when this interface is recognized and understood, it can create solutions that work. With this comprehension, people can adapt to the present and begin determining what they can do now to leave the planet a little better for each generation.

Whether you need a new tool or just inspiration, Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks explores modern options, giving you a taste of each with ideas that will help you create better apps. You'll see frameworks that leverage modern programming languages, employ unique architectures, live client-side instead of server-side, or embrace type systems. You'll see everything from familiar Ruby and JavaScript to the more exotic Erlang, Haskell, and Clojure.  The rapid evolution of web apps demands innovative solutions: this survey of frameworks and their unique perspectives will inspire you and get you thinking in new ways to meet the challenges you face daily.  This book covers seven web frameworks that are influencing modern web applications and changing web development: Sinatra, CanJS, AngularJS, Ring, Webmachine, Yesod, Immutant. Each of these web frameworks brings unique and powerful ideas to bear on building apps.  Embrace the simplicity of Sinatra, which sheds the trappings of large frameworks and gets back to basics with Ruby. Live in the client with CanJS, and create apps with JavaScript in the browser. Be declarative with AngularJS; say what you want, not how to do it, with a mixture of declarative HTML and JavaScript. Turn the web into data with Ring, and use Clojure to make data your puppet. Become a master of advanced HTTP with Webmachine, and focus the power of Erlang. Prove web theorems with Yesod; see how Haskell's advanced type system isn't just for academics. Develop in luxury with Immutant, an enlightened take on the enterprise framework. Seven Web Frameworks will influence your work, no matter which framework you currently use.  Welcome to a wider web. What You Need:   You'll need Windows, MacOS X or Linux, along with your favorite web browser. Each chapter will cover what you need to download and which language versions are required.

Nginx -完全取代Apache，超輕、快、強的Web伺服器 --第二版,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/2013120288980?zone=book&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=70,張宴,佳魁      ,9789865712228.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/book/images/product/20131/2013120288980/2013120288980b.jpg,"


 Nginx（engine x）是俄羅斯人Igor Sysoev 撰寫的一款高性能的HTTP 和反向代理伺服器。Nginx 選擇了epoll 和kqueue 作為網路I/O 模型，在高連接並行的情況下，Nginx 是Apache 伺服器不錯的替代品，它能夠支援高達50,000 個並行連接數的回應，執行穩定，且記憶體、CPU 等系統資源消耗非常低。


 除了少數具有開發能力的公司之外，商業網站架設就是二選一，Linux 陣營Apache，Windows 選IIS，長久以來，這兩個產品霸佔了90% 以上的Web 伺服器市場。在選完邊後，我們也忙著偵錯、校調，最佳化、設定，設計這個既定的架構，不斷的找資料，問專家，想方案，以應付日益龐大及複雜的應用環境。


 但是，有沒有其它的選擇，讓我們一開始就不需要煩惱已經可預見的問題？


 Apache 如其名，一開始當然是一個以「補丁(patch，英文發音接近)」為主的Web 伺服器。但在「自由軟體」的加持下，與身處相對較穩定的類Unix 環境中，自然受「較高級」工程師寵愛。但這個對於Windows 系統的虛榮優勢，在同處於類Unix 環境的其它產品中不見得能佔到便宜。Nginx 這個後起之秀的網頁伺服器，在Linux 環境下，讓Apache 馬上降級成面對夢幻隊的板凳球員。


 許多知名公司在招聘系統工程師、網路工程師時，都會加上對Nginx 設定管理經驗的要求。Nginx 作為新興的Web 伺服器，發展趨勢迅猛，已經在眾多知名網站的各項產品中取代Apache。但是，Nginx 相關的中文資料卻比較欠缺，本書就是為對Nginx 伺服器實作應用感興趣的讀者準備的。


 雲端時代進入高原期，虛擬化在底層已完全成熟，上層的平台是否還有進步空間不得而知，但能讓同樣硬體發揮5-10倍效能的軟體，相信你也會忍不住想試試。學習Nginx 也許無法讓你立即高人一等，但換個完全相容又更強大的產品，而無需陡峭的學習曲線，怎麼看都是蠻酷的一件事。

Rails just keeps on changing. Both Rails 3 and 4, as well as Ruby 1.9 and 2.0, bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so it's more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails.  Rails 4 introduces a number of user-facing changes, and the ebook has been updated to match all the latest changes and new best practices in Rails. This includes full support for Ruby 2.0, controller concerns, Russian Doll caching, strong parameters, Turbolinks, new test and bin directory layouts, and much more.  Ruby on Rails helps you produce high-quality, beautiful-looking web applications quickly. You concentrate on creating the application, and Rails takes care of the details.  Tens of thousands of developers have used this award-winning book to learn Rails. It's a broad, far-reaching tutorial and reference that's recommended by the Rails core team. If you're new to Rails, you'll get step-by-step guidance. If you're an experienced developer, this book will give you the comprehensive, insider information you need.  Rails has evolved over the years, and this book has evolved along with it. We still start with a step-by-step walkthrough of building a real application, and in-depth chapters look at the built-in Rails features. This edition now gives new Ruby and Rails users more information on the Ruby language and takes more time to explain key concepts throughout. Best practices on how to apply Rails continue to change, and this edition keeps up. Examples use Concerns, Russian Doll caching, and Turbolinks, and the book focuses throughout on the right way to use Rails. Additionally, this edition now works on Ruby 2.0, a new release of Ruby with substantial functional and performance improvements.  This edition is for Rails4.0 and beyond.

""Modern Compiler Design"" makes the topic of compiler design more accessible by focusing on principles and techniques of wide application. By carefully distinguishing between the essential (material that has a high chance of being useful) and the incidental (material that will be of benefit only in exceptional cases) much useful information was packed in this comprehensive volume. The student who has finished this book can expect to understand the workings of and add to a language processor for each of the modern paradigms, and be able to read the literature on how to proceed. The first provides a firm basis, the second potential for growth.

Designing for the Web is a wonderful thing. The ability to publish something and have it appear immediately and globally is an empowering feeling. I'll never forget the first rush I felt when, as a print designer, I could simply ""upload"" some files and have them be immediately visible, rather than waiting in trepidation for the boxes to return from the printer. Back then the Web was simpler, there were fewer materials and tools, and ""styling"" was something you hacked together using bizarre hacks and workarounds to achieve even the simplest of tasks. The browser landscape was equally testing. Now we're in a much better position. We have a wonderful thing called CSS that allows us to style pages with concise style rules and leave the HTML to describe the content, not the pr- entation. Content can be repurposed for different media. But anyone keen to learn web design (from scratch, or to improve their existing skills) has a bewildering job on their hands. The publishing market is saturated with good books on web design, HTML, and CSS. Yet if you were asked for a single book that encompasses all three, and that someone could understand without assuming any prior ""Internet knowledge,"" what would you recommend? Still trying to think of one? A regular contributor to . net/Practical Web Design magazine, Craig Grannell has written The Essential Guide to CSS and HTML Web Design for this purpose.

Electronic Signals and Systems,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c200918556?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=71,"Muhammad Nasir,Khan",River Publishers,9788770221702.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1702/9788770221702.jpg,"

The subject of Signals and Systems is enormously complex, involving many concepts such as signals, mathematics and filter design that are woven together in an intricate manner. To cope with this scope and complexity, many Signals and Systems texts are often organized around the ""numerical examples"" of a system. With such organization, students can see through the complexity of Signals and Systems, they can learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the Authors extensive experience of teaching and research, the book is written with such a reader in mind. The Book is intended for a course on signals & systems at the senior undergraduate level and above. The authors consider all the requirements and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for filter design and signal processing.

Nonlinear Powerflow Control Design presents an innovative control system design process motivated by renewable energy electric grid integration problems. The concepts developed result from the convergence of three research and development goals:  - to create a unifying metric to compare the value of different energy sources - coal-burning power plant, wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, etc. - to be integrated into the electric power grid and to replace the typical metric of costs/profit; - to develop a new nonlinear control tool that applies power flow control, thermodynamics, and complex adaptive systems theory to the energy grid in a consistent way; and - to apply collective robotics theories to the creation of high-performance teams of people and key individuals in order to account for human factors in controlling and selling power into a distributed, decentralized electric power grid.  All three of these goals have important concepts in common: exergy flow, limit cycles, and balance between competing power flows. In place of the typical zero-sum, stability vs. performance, linear controller design process, the authors propose a unique set of criteria to design controllers for a class of systems nonlinear with respect to both performance and stability, and seamlessly integrating information theoretic concepts. A combination of thermodynamics with Hamiltonian systems provides the theoretical foundation which is then realized in a series of connected case studies. It allows the process of control design to be viewed as a power flow control problem, balancing the power flowing into a system against that being dissipated within it and dependent on the power being stored in it - an interplay between kinetic and potential energies. Highlights of several of the case studies feature current renewable energy problems such as the future of electric power grid control, wind turbine load alleviation, and novel control designs for micro-grids that incorporate wind and sunlight as renewable energy sources. Human factors and the sustainability of self-organizing systems are dealt with as advanced topics. Research scientists, practicing engineers, engineering students, and others with a background in engineering will be able to develop and apply this methodology to their particular problems.

As devices get smarter, they -- and the companies that created them -- gather more and more data about you, the user: what you like, where you go, even listening to and recording conversations around the house. It's easy to gloss over how much data is getting stored in ""the cloud"" everyday without you knowing, but with a little effort, you don't have to trade privacy for functionality. In this issue of Make: , we address this head-on. We'll show you how to set up your own DIY voice assistants using free and private tools that keep your data local while performing your favorite tasks. You can even run one on a Raspberry Pi! Then, configure a WebThings gateway from Mozilla to keep your IoT gadgets connected but private. And if you still can't give up Alexa's bells and whistles, at least consider assembling the Alias Privacy Parasite, which lets you decide when Alexa gets to listen in.The issue also continues our Fix the Planet series with a set of guidelines on effective ways to electrify your cars and homes to slash your carbon output (and save you money along the way).Plus, 17 exciting projects, including: Convert any bike to electric with a front wheel motor kitMake your needlework come alive with embroidery animationTips on converting a metal lathe to CNC with free softwareGrow vegan leather for projects and cosplayAnd much more!

This artist designed coloring book features 25 fanciful brain designs. Anyone with a brain will enjoy it. Makes a great gift for neuroscientists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, mindfulness practitioners and meditators, students and teachers. Those who have had a brain illness or injury, and their caregivers, have also found inspiration in these coloring pages. Let your imagination run wild while you color the designs in this book and use the 3 blank brains at the back to create your own fanciful design. An extra half inch margin at the binding leaves you enough room to cut out a finished brain and each design is sized for a standard 8x10 inch frame. Use colored pencils or markers. You'll want to stick a piece of blank paper behind a page before using markers in case of bleed through to protect the design behind it. About the artist: Laura Bundesen lives in western Massachusetts. She has been making artwork since the 1980's and creating neuroscience themed artwork since 2014, working primarily as a mixed media artist using fabric, thread and paint to explore the magical human brain. Most of her pieces feature a large dose of hand embroidery, an art practice that she finds both soothing and meditative, much like coloring.

Handbook of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety in Engineering Design studies the combination of various methods of designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, as well as the latest techniques in probability and possibility modelling, mathematical algorithmic modelling, evolutionary algorithmic modelling, symbolic logic modelling, artificial intelligence modelling, and object-oriented computer modelling, in a logically structured approach to determining the integrity of engineering design.  Handbook of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety in Engineering Design not only encompasses a depth of research into engineering design methods and techniques ranging from quantitative probability theory and expert judgement in Bayesian analysis to qualitative possibility theory, fuzzy logic and uncertainty in Markov analysis; from reliability block diagrams, fault trees, event trees and cause-consequence diagrams to Petri nets, genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks; but it also covers a breadth of research into the concept of integrity in engineering design. Such breadth of research is represented by the inclusion of the topics of reliability and performance, availability and maintainability, and safety and risk, in an overall concept of designing for integrity during the different phases of the engineering design process. These topics add significant value to the theoretical expertise and practical experience of process, chemical, civil, mechanical, electrical, and electronic engineers, by considering process engineering design from the point of view of ""what should be achieved"" to meet criteria for designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety.

Andreas B瓣rmann develops novel approaches for the solution of network design problems as they arise in various contexts of applied optimization. At the example of an optimal expansion of the German railway network until 2030, the author derives a tailor-made decomposition technique for multi-period network design problems. Next, he develops a general framework for the solution of network design problems via aggregation of the underlying graph structure. This approach is shown to save much computation time as compared to standard techniques. Finally, the author devises a modelling framework for the approximation of the robust counterpart under ellipsoidal uncertainty, an often-studied case in the literature. Each of these three approaches opens up a fascinating branch of research which promises a better theoretical understanding of the problem and an increasing range of solvable application settings at the same time.

How do developers bring existing applications into a portal? How do developers integrate content management systems and search engines with a portal? And how do developers get started with the Portlet API? Jeff Linwood and Dave Minter show you how to solve these real problems in Building Portals with the Java Portlet API. This book describes the new Java portlet API, including security, portlet life cycles, and portlet interaction with servlets and JSP. The examples will work on any portal that complies with the JSR-168 portlet API. Several example portlets are developed to give you hands-on portlet experience. You'll even learn how to port existing servlet and JSP applications into a new portal environment.The authors also discuss Single Sign-On (SSO) using Kerberos and the GSS-API, syndicating content with RSS, and integrating a charting solution with JFreeChart. Other topics covered are the open-source Apache Jakarta Lucene search engine, personalization, portlet configuration, portlet preferences, and Web Services for Remote Portals (WSRP). XDoclet is also used throughout portions of this book.

Real critique has become a lost skill among collaborative teams today. Critique is intended to help teams strengthen their designs, products, and services, rather than be used to assert authority or push agendas under the guise of ""feedback."" In this practical guide, authors Adam Connor and Aaron Irizarry teach you techniques, tools, and a framework for helping members of your design team give and receive critique.Using firsthand stories and lessons from prominent figures in the design community, this book examines the good, the bad, and the ugly of feedback. You'll come away with tips, actionable insights, activities, and a cheat sheet for practicing critique as a part of your collaborative process.This book covers: Best practices (and anti-patterns) for giving and receiving critiqueCultural aspects that influence your ability to critique constructivelyWhen, how much, and how often to use critique in the creative processFacilitation techniques for making critiques timely and more effectiveStrategies for dealing with difficult people and challenging situations

While compilers for high-level programming languages are large complex software systems, they have particular characteristics that differentiate them from other software systems. Their functionality is almost completely well-defined - ideally there exist complete precise descriptions of the source and target languages. Additional descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, programming system and programming environment, and to other compilers and libraries are often available. This book deals with the analysis phase of translators for programming languages. It describes lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, specification mechanisms for these tasks from the theory of formal languages, and methods for automatic generation based on the theory of automata. The authors present a conceptual translation structure, i.e., a division into a set of modules, which transform an input program into a sequence of steps in a machine program, and they then describe the interfaces between the modules. Finally, the structures of real translators are outlined. The book contains the necessary theory and advice for implementation. This book is intended for students of computer science. The book is supported throughout with examples, exercises and program fragments.

Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.  Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.  The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:  Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.  There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.

JSP、Servlet、Struts、Hibernate、AOP、WebWork、Spring、EJB⋯，好複雜，這麼多技術到底都是做什麼的？它們有什麼關聯呢？近幾年，Web 程式發展異常迅猛，不僅出現了形形色色的購物網站、交友網站、銀行自助系統等，還出現像Palm OS Web作業系統、可以替代Office等傳統辦公軟體的Google Document等功能強大的Web程式。這些主要得益於Web程式的精簡型用戶端的特點，即不需要客戶安裝任何軟體，只需要使用瀏覽器即可完成操作。Web程式可以非常簡單，簡單到只有幾個HTML頁面、幾張圖片，例如小型企業的介紹性網站等。也可以非常複雜，例如Google Document 網站，完全可以替代Word、Excel、PPT、PDF 閱讀器等；Google Talk 也完全可以替代QQ、MSN等。實現這些Web程式所用到的技術也很多，最流行的有微軟的.NET技術和Java相關技術。Java 相關技術作為最流行的開發技術之一，在Web 開發領域也有著非常廣泛的應用。但Java Web開發所涉及的技術比較繁雜，涉及很多開發Framework 和工具，而且它們各有所長，並不完全是一個完善的體系。這對需要掌握Java Web開發的人來說，有一定的困難。筆者曾經任職於IBM 中國研究院、諾基亞北京研發中心和用友軟體等公司，有幸系統地學習了Java Web開發的的技術，並從事大量的實際專案，累積了豐富的開發經驗。為了幫助讀者更好、更快速地掌握Java Web 開發，筆者花費一年多的時間寫作本書，把Java Web 開發所涉及的技術進行歸納和總結，以最簡單易懂的實例進行講解。相信讀者學習完本書內容，可以很全面地掌握Java Web開發所涉及的技術，也會清楚它們之間的關聯，提升Java Web 開發水準。

Talking to people about your designs might seem like a basic skill, but it can be difficult to do efficiently and well. And, in many cases, how you communicate about your work with stakeholders, clients, and other non-designers is more critical than the designs themselves--simply because the most articulate person usually wins.This practical guide focuses on principles, tactics, and actionable methods for presenting your designs. Whether you design UX, websites, or products, you'll learn how to win over anyone who has influence over the project--with the goal of creating the best experience for the end user.Walk through the process of preparing for and presenting your designsUnderstand stakeholder perspectives, and learn how to empathize with themCultivate both implicit and explicit listening skillsLearn tactics and formulas for expressing the most effective response to feedbackDiscover why the way you follow through is just as crucial as the meeting itselfEducate your stakeholders by sharing the chapter from this book on how to work with designers

Additive Manufacturing,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c005440060?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=76,"Gokuldoss,Prashanth Konda",Mdpi AG,9783039283521.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3521/9783039283521.jpg,"

Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the manufacturing processes that warrants the attention of industrialists, researchers and scientists, because of its ability to produce materials with a complex shape without theoretical restrictions and with added functionalities. There are several advantages to employing additive manufacturing as the primary additive manufacturing process. However, there exist several challenges that need to be addressed systematically. A couple such issues are alloy design and process development. Traditionally alloys designed for conventional cast/powder metallurgical processes were fabricated using advanced AM processes. This is the wrong approach considering that the alloys should be coined based on the process characteristics and meta-stable nature of the process. Hence, we must focus on alloy design and development for AM that suits the AM processes. The AM processes, however, improve almost every day, either in terms of processing capabilities or processing conditions. Hence, the processing part warrants a section that is devoted to these advancements and innovations. Accordingly, the present Special Issue (book) focuses on two aspects of alloy development and process innovations. Here, 45 articles are presented covering different AM processes including selective laser melting, electron beam melting, laser cladding, direct metal laser sintering, ultrasonic consolidation, wire arc additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. I believe that this Special Issue bears is vital to the field of AM and will be a valuable addition.

Optimal Design of Water Distribution Networks,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109950222?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=76,"P R,Bhave",Ingram      ,9781842651322.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1322/9781842651322.jpg,"

Design of water distribution networks is traditionally based on trial-and-approach in which the designer assumes, based on experience and judgment, sizes of different elements and successively modifies them until a network with satisfactory hydraulic performance is obtained. This text covers: - Essential hydraulic, economic optimization principles.- Theory is developed gradually for optimal design of simple, single-source branched networks subjected to single loading to complex, multiple-source looped networks subjected to multiple loading.- Strengthening and expansion of existing networks and also reliability-based design.- Several illustrative examples enabling the reader to apply them in practice- approximately 100 line drawings.

This book is mainly concerned on use novel algorithms to reduce the power consumption used in modern digital modems e.g. QPSK. The designing and the simulation it will be in MATLAB. It will involve hardware implementation using VHDL and Xilinx FPGAs. In this project a novel low power modem will be designed for use in communication systems. For the designing it will use some of the modern radio communication technologies such as QPSK (OQPSK, BPSK etc) with the aim of designing and simulate a filter in MATLAB using Gaussian, Rayleigh and Rician channels. The simulation of QPSK and FIR filter will made in the SIMULINK of MATLAB. In this model will generate noise and how may bits it will transmitted and how many errors it will received. The final output of all is that in this model in a screen which called Error Rate Calculation. For the VHDL and Xilinx FPGAs will present an overview of the digital design and VHDL, the logic gates, the ASIC design and FPGAs. Finally for the VHDL and ASIC design, it is present schematic diagrams like full adders, parallel adders and multipliers from the Engineering Capture System (ECS).

The Design of Requirements Modelling Languages,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109185645?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=77,"Ivan,Jureta",Springer    ,9783319188201.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8201/9783319188201.jpg,"

This book explains in detail how to define requirements modelling languages - formal languages used to solve requirement-related problems in requirements engineering. It moves from simple languages to more complicated ones and uses these languages to illustrate a discussion of major topics in requirements modelling language design.The book positions requirements problem solving within the framework of broader research on ill-structured problem solving in artificial intelligence and engineering in general. Further, it introduces the reader to many complicated issues in requirements modelling language design, starting from trivial questions and the definition of corresponding simple languages used to answer them, and progressing to increasingly complex issues and languages. In this way the reader is led step by step (and with the help of illustrations) to learn about the many challenges involved in designing modelling languages for requirements engineering.The book offers the first comprehensive treatment of a major challenge in requirements engineering and business analysis, namely, how to design and define requirements modelling languages. It is intended for researchers and graduate students interested in advanced topics of requirements engineering and formal language design.

Nginx –完全取代Apache，超輕、快、強的Web伺服器,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/2013120215795?zone=book&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=78,張宴,佳魁      ,9789865908072.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/book/images/product/20131/2013120215795/2013120215795b.jpg,"

除了少數具有開發能力的公司之外，由於歷史因素和使用習慣，商業網站架設就是二選一，Linux 陣營Apache，Windows 選IIS，長久以來，這兩個產品當然霸佔了90% 以上的Web 伺服器市場，在選完邊之後，我們也忙著偵錯、校調，最佳化、設定，設計這個既定的架構，不斷的找資料，問專家，想方案，以應付日益龐大及複雜的應用環境。　　但是，有沒有其它的選擇，讓我們從一開始就不需要煩惱已經可預見的問題？　　Apache 如其名，一開始當然是一個以「補丁(patch，英文發音接近)」為主的Web 伺服器。但在「自由軟體」的加持下，再加上身處相對較穩定的類Unix 環境中，自然成為「較高級」工程師的寵愛。但這個對於Windows 系統的虛榮優勢，在同處於類Unix 環境的其它產品中不見得能佔什麼便宜。Nginx 這個後起之秀的網頁伺服器，在Linux 環境下，讓Apache 馬上降級成面對夢幻隊的板凳球員。　　Nginx（“engine x”）是俄羅斯人Igor Sysoev 撰寫的一款高性能的HTTP 和反向代理伺服器。Nginx 選擇了epoll 和kqueue 作為網路I/O 模型，在高連接並行的情況下，Nginx 是Apache 伺服器不錯的替代品，它能夠支援高達50,000 個並行連接數的回應，執行穩定，且記憶體、CPU 等系統資源消耗非常低。　　近期，許多知名網際網路公司的系統工程師、網路工程師招聘資訊中，都加上了一條對Nginx 設定管理經驗的要求。Nginx 作為新興的Web 伺服器，目前的發展趨勢迅猛，已經在眾多知名網站的各項產品中取代Apache。但是，Nginx 相關的中文資料卻比較欠缺，本書就是為對Nginx 伺服器實作應用感興趣的讀者準備的，適用於以前沒有接觸過Nginx，或者對Nginx 有一些了解並希望能夠進一步深入，以及對Nginx 有較多研究，希望共同探討的專業系統工程師、個人網站站長及一切Linux/Unix 從業人員。　　雲端時代進入高原期，虛擬化在底層已完全成熟，上層的平台是否還有進步空間不得而知，但能讓同樣硬體發揮5-10倍效能的軟體，相信你也會忍不住想試試。台灣叢薾小國若不放眼全球市場，不是Thomas Friedman 眼中「創意加工」型的人，遲早會成為扁平世界3.0 的泡沫，學習Nginx 也許無法讓你立即高人一等，但換個完全相容又更強大的產品，而無需陡峭的學習曲線，怎麼看都是蠻酷的一件事。

Additive Manufacturing Volume 2,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c005441479?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=78,"Gokuldoss,Prashanth",Mdpi AG,9783039284146.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4146/9783039284146.jpg,"

Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the manufacturing processes that warrants the attention of industrialists, researchers and scientists, because of its ability to produce materials with a complex shape without theoretical restrictions and with added functionalities. There are several advantages to employing additive manufacturing as the primary additive manufacturing process. However, there exist several challenges that need to be addressed systematically. A couple such issues are alloy design and process development. Traditionally alloys designed for conventional cast/powder metallurgical processes were fabricated using advanced AM processes. This is the wrong approach considering that the alloys should be coined based on the process characteristics and meta-stable nature of the process. Hence, we must focus on alloy design and development for AM that suits the AM processes. The AM processes, however, improve almost every day, either in terms of processing capabilities or processing conditions. Hence, the processing part warrants a section that is devoted to these advancements and innovations. Accordingly, the present Special Issue (book) focuses on two aspects of alloy development and process innovations. Here, 45 articles are presented covering different AM processes including selective laser melting, electron beam melting, laser cladding, direct metal laser sintering, ultrasonic consolidation, wire arc additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. I believe that this Special Issue bears is vital to the field of AM and will be a valuable addition.

As a developer new to Web Services, how do you make sense of this emerging framework so you can start writing your own services today? This concise book gives programmers both a concrete introduction and a handy reference to XML web services, first by explaining the foundations of this new breed of distributed services, and then by demonstrating quick ways to create services with open-source Java tools.Web Services make it possible for diverse applications to discover each other and exchange data seamlessly via the Internet. For instance, programs written in Java and running on Solaris can find and call code written in C# that run on Windows XP, or programs written in Perl that run on Linux, without any concern about the details of how that service is implemented. A common set of Web Services is at the core of Microsoft's new .NET strategy, Sun Microsystems's Sun One Platform, and the W3C's XML Protocol Activity Group.In this book, author Ethan Cerami explores four key emerging technologies: XML Remote Procedure Calls (XML-RPC)SOAP - The foundation for most commercial Web Services developmentUniversal Discovery, Description and Integration (UDDI)Web Services Description Language (WSDL)For each of these topics, Web Services Essentials provides a quick overview, Java tutorials with sample code, samples of the XML documents underlying the service, and explanations of freely-available Java APIs. Cerami also includes a guide to the current state of Web Services, pointers to open-source tools and a comprehensive glossary of terms.If you want to break through the Web Services hype and find useful information on these evolving technologies, look no further than Web Services Essentials.

Research for the development of more efficient photocatalysts has experienced an almost exponential growth since its popularization in early 1970's. Despite the advantages of the widely used TiO2, the yield of the conversion of sun power into chemical energy that can be achieved with this material is limited prompting the research and development of a number of structural, morphological and chemical modifications of TiO2, as well as a number of novel photocatalysts with very different composition. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a systematic account of the current understanding of the relationships between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and photoactivity. The already long list of photocatalysts phases and their modifications is increasing day by day. By approaching this field from a material sciences angle, an integrated view allows readers to consider the diversity of photocatalysts globally and in connection with other technologies. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a valuable road-map, outlining the common principles lying behind the diversity of materials, but also delimiting the imprecise border between the contrasted results and the most speculative studies. This broad approach makes it ideal for specialist but also for engineers, researchers and students in related fields.

Integrating SOA and Web Services highlights how to integrate and realize Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with web services, which is one of the emerging technologies in IT. It additionally focuses on the latest technologies such as Metadata Management, Security issues, Quality of Service, and its commercialization. One chapter is also devoted to the study of Emerging standards and development tools for Enterprise Application Integration. Most enterprises have made extensive investments in system resources over the course of many years. Such enterprises have an enormous amount of data stored in legacy enterprise information systems (EIS), so it is not practical to discard existing systems. It is more cost-effective to evolve and enhance EIS. This could be done with the help of SOA. SOA is usually realized through web services. Web services specifications may add to the confusion of how to best to utilize SOA to solve business problems. In order for a smooth transition to SOA, using an architectural style that helps in realizing web services through SOA, this book concentrates on this architecture, realization, and integration of SOA with web services. It consists of 12 chapters and is recommended for all postgraduate Computer Science Students.

Figliola and Beasley's 6th edition of ""Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements"" provides a time-tested and respected approach to the theory of engineering measurements. An emphasis on the role of statistics and uncertainty analysis in the measuring process makes this text unique. While the measurements discipline is very broad, careful selection of topical coverage, establishes the physical principles and practical techniques for quantifying many engineering variables that have multiple engineering applications. In the sixth edition, ""Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements"" continues to emphasize the conceptual design framework for selecting and specifying equipment, test procedures and interpreting test results. Coverage of topics, applications and devices has been updated--including information on data acquisition hardware and communication protocols, infrared imaging, and microphones. New examples that illustrate either case studies or interesting vignettes related to the application of measurements in current practice are introduced.The code on this card will provide you access to the E-Text version of ""Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements, "" 6e.

Design makes a tremendous impact on the produced world in terms of usability, resources, understanding, and priorities. What we produce, how we serve customers and other stakeholders, and even how we understand how the world works is all affected by the design of models and solutions. Designers have an unprecedented opportunity to use their skills to make meaningful, sustainable change in the world--if they know how to focus their skills, time, and agendas. In Design is the Problem: The Future of Design Must be Sustainable, Nathan Shedroff examines how the endemic culture of design often creates unsustainable solutions, and shows how designers can bake sustainability into their design processes in order to produce more sustainable solutions.

Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they're siblings that grew up in different houses. They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design. This book will show you how.

I believe in the W3C's principle of One Web--that services and information on the web should be thematically consistent and accessible to all kinds of devices, without regard to differences in presentation capabilities. Informally, the One Web principle means that if I write my grocery list online at home in Firefox, I should be able to view the list and check off my purchases at the grocery store using my mobile phone. That said, the Mobile Web and its ecosystem are unique in many ways--in access patterns, user behaviors, browser technologies, and client capabilities. A recent mobiThinking report coined the maxim ""utility is the engine of the Mobile Web"". This phrase has become my mantra for Mobile Web development and I encourage you to adopt it as well. Mobile Web content succeeds when it solves a real problem for a user on the move. Driving directions, public transportation, business listings, news headlines, social networking, and banking are all examples of content that succeeds on the Mobile Web because real people using mobile phones in their daily lives find this information to be relevant, local, and immediately available.

Design happens everywhere, whether in animate objects (e.g., dendritic lung structures, bacterial colonies, and corals), inanimate patterns (river basins, beach slope, and dendritic crystals), social dynamics (pedestrian traffic flows), or engineered systems (heat dissipation in electronic circuitry). This ""design in nature"" often takes on remarkably similar patterns, which can be explained under one unifying Constructal Law. This book explores the unifying power of the Constructal Law and its applications in all domains of design generation and evolution, ranging from biology and geophysics to globalization, energy, sustainability, and security. The Constructal Law accounts for the universal tendency of flow systems to morph into evolving configurations that provide greater and easier access over time. The Constructal Law resolves the many and contradictory ad hoc statements of ""optimality"", end design, and destiny in nature, such as minimum and maximum entropy production and minimum and maximum flow resistance, and also explains the designs that are observed and copied in biomimetics. Constructal Law and the Unifying Principle of Design covers the fundamentals of Constructal Theory and Design, as well as presenting a variety of state-of-the-art applications. Experts from the biological, physical and social sciences demonstrate the unification of all design phenomena in nature, and apply this knowledge to novel designs in modern engineering, such as vascularization for self-healing and self-cooling materials for aircraft, and tree fins and cavities for heat transfer enhancement.

　　作為台灣市場第一本完整且深入介紹AWS應用的專書，本書邀請到的作者林允溥是有多年AWS操作經驗的專家，專精於將社群網站和遊戲網站，設計成適合雲端運算架構，他將把這些寶貴的心得帶入台灣的雲端市場中。本書特色　　1. 以世界上目前最成功的雲端運算服務：「Amazon Web Services（AWS）」為主題，分享實際應用時的「可行策略」。　　2. 分享作者長期使用AWS的經驗，包含遭遇到的各種問題與解決方法，並總評為何雲端運算仍然具有絕對優勢和商業利益。　　3. 台灣第一本AWS實際應用方法的專書，由台灣作者以在地應用經驗撰寫，是企業改造、網站創業者必備書籍。　　AWS（Amazon Web Services），目前世界上最成功的雲端運算服務，非常多新創網站或中小型企業透過AWS架設自己的雲端資料庫、網路應用系統，許多大型企業也會利用 AWS架設企業內部的部份雲端功能，許多大型網路公司（例如twitter、zynga）也會利用AWS的優勢，快速更新自己的服務。　　AWS可以理解為是主機代管、虛擬主機的雲端進化，也是現今最熱門的發展趨勢，它具有便宜、快速、穩定和充滿彈性的特色。相對於企業在自己公司內部設立實體主機，使用AWS雲端主機的第一個直接優點就是即使只有一個網管也有辦法勝任管理工作。　　而相對於企業使用傳統主機代管，AWS的最大不同就是「雲端化」。簡單的說，不管是傳統主機、虛擬主機都還是從實體主機維護的思維出發，但是AWS是以「服務」的組合操作為核心精神，你只需要設定：我需要多少空間？多少流量？多少彈性？多少功能？我想要資料離哪一地區比較近？一設定完下一秒立刻生效，並且隨時可以調整，完全打破傳統實體主機申租的思維。　　AWS是全球性的服務，非常適合網路創業、企業內部IT優化，而這本書將帶來中文世界的讀者一起進入AWS的雲端世界。

You hold in your hands a recipe book. With clear examples and no wasted words, designer Dan Cederholm shows how to put web standards to work creating beautiful, lightweight interfaces that are accessible to all. Dan isn't here to make the creative or business case for standards-based web design. Others (cough) have already done that. And frankly, if you've bothered to pick up this book and thumb through its pages, you probably already know the accessibility, longevity, and business benefits standards-based design provides. You don't need another overview or elevator pitch; you need a practical, roll-up-your-sleeves, component view, and that's what this book delivers. In down-to-earth, natural language--the same kind of language that's found on good websites-- Dan examines universal site elements such as page divisions and navigation. Using a teaching method he pioneered at SimpleBits.com, Dan shows how web standards make these universal page components easier to create, easier to modify when your boss or client requests la- minute changes, and most important of all, easier for people to use.

Web 2.0 is more pervasive than ever, with business analysts and technologists struggling to comprehend the opportunity it represents. So what exactly is Web 2.0 -- a marketing term or technical reality? This fascinating book finally puts substance behind the phenomenon by identifying the core patterns of Web 2.0, and by introducing an abstract model and reference architecture to help you take advantage of them.  In Web 2.0 Architectures, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor -- who have 40 years of combined experience with technical specifications and industry trends -- examine what makes successful Web 2.0 services such as Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia work. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.  This book reveals:  A Web 2.0 model:  How the classic Client-Server model evolved into a more detailed Web 2.0 model. Web 2.0 reference architecture:  A generic component view of basic Web 2.0 patterns that can be repurposed for other commercial ventures. Specific Web 2.0 patterns:  How service oriented architecture (SOA), Software as a Service (SaaS), participation-collaboration, mashups, rich user experience, collaborative tagging systems (Folksonomy), and more can be used in your business.  If you want to understand what makes Web 2.0 tick, and how it will enhance your business, Web 2.0 Architectures takes you right to the core.

Now in full color, the 10th anniversary edition of this classic book takes you deep into the influences that underlie modern video games, and examines the elements they share with traditional games such as checkers. At the heart of his exploration, veteran game designer Raph Koster takes a close look at the concept of fun and why it's the most vital element in any game.Why do some games become boring quickly, while others remain fun for years? How do games serve as fundamental and powerful learning tools?

A leader in the field of data visualization, Stephen Few exposes the common problems in dashboard design and describes its best practices in great detail and with a multitude of examples in this updated second edition. According to the author, dashboards have become a popular means to present critical information at a glance, yet few do so effectively. He purports that when designed well, dashboards engage the power of visual perception to communicate a dense collection of information efficiently and with exceptional clarity and that visual design skills that address the unique challenges of dashboards are not intuitive but rather learned. The book not only teaches how to design dashboards but also gives a deep understanding of the concepts--rooted in brain science--that explain the why behind the how. This revised edition offers six new chapters with sections that focus on fundamental considerations while assessing requirements, in-depth instruction in the design of bullet graphs and sparklines, and critical steps to follow during the design process. Examples of graphics and dashboards have been updated throughout, including additional samples of well-designed dashboards.

This long-awaited complement to Appleman's previous bestseller shows programmers how to turbocharge VB by describing how to control the entire Windows API. Divided into three parts, the book begins with a series of programming puzzles of increasing complexity. Each puzzle describes a typical API function, followed by a small VB program applying the function. These programs almost work but are all missing something. Readers are challenged to solve the puzzle and fix the program -- thus learning in the process. The second part contains solutions to the puzzles, along with in-depth technical explanations, while the final part concludes with general tutorials that readers can refer to for help in solving the problems.

	近年來，健康照護的服務訴求已經從傳統觀念下的「病痛解除」轉變成更為注重根本的「健康維護」。因此，相關的醫療服務也逐漸從「治療」轉變成「療癒」。可是，究竟要如何設計、規劃、才能營造出一個真正以「病患親善」為訴求的明日環境？

	本書提出以「身體／心理／靈性」三方面的關聯作為模式架構。一個真正有意義的「療癒環境」，也必須能夠兼顧一個「全人」在這三方面的修為。本書將針對「心靈的療癒」進行探討，「知識就是力量」──當我們知道的越多，我們就越不會感到害怕，並強調「病患授權（patient empowerment）」的觀念，藉以闡述人們對環境的認識與瞭解，會如何影響病患的療癒成效。

	為了讓「身體／心理／靈性」模式顯得更加完備，本書著重於「以自然世界為師」，闡述人們在「靈性」方面的需求，並討論一些「神性的」概念以及其與健康照護環境的關係。

The Software Design Guide provides the hands-on application of the theory presented in the textbook. The SDG should be considered an integral part of the curriculum. It is where students take the theory learned in the textbook and use that knowledge to build video games. Working in simulated design teams, students will experience all aspects of video game design, from the planning stages, through the design and programming, and concluding with a capstone project.  Each chapter in the SDG is correlated to the textbook chapter. There are several activities for each chapter. The last chapter in the SDG is a capstone project that requires students to apply all of the knowledge acquired in the textbook and SDG. The activities in the software design guide make use of The Games Factory 2, which is a fully-functioning game engine (not a demo version). The Games Factory 2 is available free to schools with the purchase of the software design guide. It may be installed on any school owned or leased computer.

	Figliola and Beasley’s 6th edition of Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements provides a time-tested and respected approach to the theory of engineering measurements. An emphasis on the role of statistics and uncertainty analysis in the measuring process makes this text unique. While the measurements discipline is very broad, careful selection of topical coverage, establishes the physical principles and practical techniques for quantifying many engineering variables that have multiple engineering applications.

	In the sixth edition, Theory and Design for Mechanical Measurements continues to emphasize the conceptual design framework for selecting and specifying equipment, test procedures and interpreting test results. Coverage of topics, applications and devices has been updated—including information on data acquisition hardware and communication protocols, infrared imaging, and microphones. New examples that illustrate either case studies or interesting vignettes related to the application of measurements in current practice are introduced.

Among the tests you perform on web applications, security testing is perhaps the most important, yet it's often the most neglected. The recipes in the Web Security Testing Cookbook demonstrate how developers and testers can check for the most common web security issues, while conducting unit tests, regression tests, or exploratory tests. Unlike ad hoc security assessments, these recipes are repeatable, concise, and systematic-perfect for integrating into your regular test suite. Recipes cover the basics from observing messages between clients and servers to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. By the end of the book, you'll be able to build tests pinpointed at Ajax functions, as well as large multi-step tests for the usual suspects: cross-site scripting and injection attacks. This book helps you: Obtain, install, and configure useful-and free-security testing tools Understand how your application communicates with users, so you can better simulate attacks in your tests Choose from many different methods that simulate common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and manipulating hidden form fields Make your tests repeatable by using the scripts and examples in the recipes as starting points for automated tests  Don't live in dread of the midnight phone call telling you that your site has been hacked. With Web Security Testing Cookbook and the free tools used in the book's examples, you can incorporate security coverage into your test suite, and sleep in peace.

Build server-side applications more efficiently--and improve your PHP programming skills in the process--by learning how to use design patterns in your code. This book shows you how to apply several object-oriented patterns through simple examples, and demonstrates many of them in full-fledged working applications. Learn how these reusable patterns help you solve complex problems, organize object-oriented code, and revise a big project by only changing small parts. With Learning PHP Design Patterns, you'll learn how to adopt a more sophisticated programming style and dramatically reduce development time. Learn design pattern concepts, including how to select patterns to handle specific problems Get an overview of object-oriented programming concepts such as composition, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance Apply creational design patterns to create pages dynamically, using a factory method instead of direct instantiation Make changes to existing objects or structure without having to change the original code, using structural design patterns Use behavioral patterns to help objects work together to perform tasks Interact with MySQL, using behavioral patterns such as Proxy and Chain of Responsibility Explore ways to use PHP's built-in design pattern interfaces

 AutoCAD 是一套有歷史的工程軟體，要將其功能指令全部都學會不是一件容易的事情。AutoCAD 的普及率已然成為工業設計及工程製圖、機械構圖、建築製圖及室內設計業界等最多人使用之軟體，當然因為它相當方便好操作，所以AutoCAD的書籍比比皆是。

 此書的撰寫概念是以室內設計實務經驗分享為出發點。以室內所需圖面表達為主軸，再將2D 的平、立面圖為優先繪製的主要考量，讓學習者在閱讀此書之同時能吸收接受繪圖指令技巧與實際練習一個案例， 並包含完整圖面及施工過程、照片輔助，剖面圖及大樣圖概念略微帶入其中說明敎授之；細節如操作環境變更及規劃、異動、撰寫修訂程式以及圖面如何導入Autodesk 3ds Max 的應用。

Why did we choose to write this book? We're both extremely busy--lecturing bachelor's degree and master's degree interactive design students, maintaining our own practice wo- ing for clients, and furthering our established careers as artists exhibiting internationally--so the idea of a ""how to"" book for would-be web designers wasn't arrived at lightly. That said, we felt the time was right for this sort of book. There are a lot of excellent books that we point our students toward: Dan Cederholm's inspiring Web Standards Solutions; Paul Haine's meticulous HTML Mastery; and Andy Budd, Cameron Moll, and Simon Collison's indispensable CSS Mastery, to name but a few. All are fantastic books and we urge our s- dents to buy every one; however, none of them seemed to cover everything our students needed to embark on a well-grounded, web standards-based approach in one package: namely, a solid foundation in well-structured XHTML coupled with a comprehensive int- duction to CSS. Cue Web Standardistas.

In this groundbreaking book, Adrian Bejan takes the recurring patterns in nature--trees, tributaries, air passages, neural networks, and lightning bolts--and reveals how a single principle of physics, the constructal law, accounts for the evolution of these and many other designs in our world. Everything--from biological life to inanimate systems--generates shape and structure and evolves in a sequence of ever-improving designs in order to facilitate flow. River basins, cardiovascular systems, and bolts of lightning are very efficient flow systems to move a current--of water, blood, or electricity. Likewise, the more complex architecture of animals evolve to cover greater distance per unit of useful energy, or increase their flow across the land. Such designs also appear in human organizations, like the hierarchical ""flowcharts"" or reporting structures in corporations and political bodies. All are governed by the same principle, known as the constructal law, and configure and reconfigure themselves over time to flow more efficiently. Written in an easy style that achieves clarity without sacrificing complexity, Design in Nature is a paradigm-shifting book that will fundamentally transform our understanding of the world around us.

Do you think that only professionals with expensive tools and years of experience can work with web graphics? This guide tosses that notion into the trash bin.Painting the Web is the first comprehensive book on web graphics to come along in years, and author Shelley Powers demonstrates how readers of any level can take advantage of the graphics and animation capabilities built into today's powerful browsers. She covers GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs, raster and vector graphics, CSS, Ajax effects, the canvas objects, SVG, geographical applications, and more -- everything that designers (and non-designers) use to literally paint the Web.More importantly, Shelley's own love of web graphics shines through in every example. Not only can you master the many different techniques, you also can have fun doing it.Topics in Painting the Web include: GIF, JPEG, PNG, lossy versus lossless compression, color management, and optimizationPhoto workflow, from camera to web page, including a review of photo editors, workflow tools, and RAW photo utilitiesTricks for best displaying your photos onlineNon-photographic raster images (icons and logos), with step-by-step tutorials for creating popular ""Web 2.0"" effects like reflection, shiny buttons, inlays, and shadowsVector graphicsAn SVG tutorial, with examples of all the major componentsTips and tricks for using CSSInteractive effects with Ajax such as accordions and fadesThe canvas object implemented in most browsersGeographical applications such as Google Maps and Yahoo Maps, with programming and non-programming examplesVisual effects such as forms and data displays in table or graphicsWeb design for the non-designerGraphics are not essential to the web experience, but they do make the difference between a site that's functional and one that's lively, compelling, and exciting. Whether you want to spruce up a website, use photos to annotate your stories, create hot graphics, or provide compelling displays for your data, this is the book for you.

Building on the success of its storefront and fulfillment services, Amazon now allows businesses to ""rent"" computing power, data storage and bandwidth on its vast network platform. This book demonstrates how developers working with small- to mid-sized companies can take advantage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as the Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Flexible Payments Service (FPS), and SimpleDB to build web-scale business applications.  With AWS, Amazon offers a new paradigm for IT infrastructure: use what you need, as you need it, and pay as you go. Programming Amazon Web Services explains how you can access Amazon's open APIs to store and run applications, rather than spend precious time and resources building your own. With this book, you'll learn all the technical details you need to: Store and retrieve any amount of data using application servers, unlimited data storage, and bandwidth with the Amazon S3 service Buy computing time using Amazon EC2's interface to requisition machines, load them with an application environment, manage access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as needed Use Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure to store messages as they travel between computers with Amazon SQS Leverage the Amazon FPS service to structure payment instructions and allow the movement of money between any two entities, humans or computers Create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and return the results using Amazon SimpleDB. Scale up or down at a moment's notice, using these services to employ as much time and space as you need Whether you're starting a new online business, need to ramp up existing services, or require an offsite backup for your home, Programming Amazon Web Services gives you the background and the practical knowledge you need to start using AWS. Other books explain how to build web services. This book teaches businesses how to take make use of existing services from an established technology leader.

How many times have you seen a web site and said, ""This would be exactly what I wanted-- if only . . . "" If only you could combine the statistics here with data from your company's earnings projections. If only you could take the addresses for those restaurants and plot them on one map. How often have you entered the date of a concert into your calendar with a single click instead of retyping? How often do you wish that you could make all the different parts of your digital world--your e-mail, your word processor documents, your photos, your search results, your maps, your presentations--work together more seamlessly? After all, it's all digital and malleable information--shouldn't it all just fit together? In fact, below the surface, all the data, web sites, and applications you use could fit together. This book teaches you how to forge those latent connections--to make the Web your own--by remixing information to create your own mashups. A mashup, in the words of the Wikipedia, is a web site or web application ""that seamlessly combines content from more than one source 1 into an integrated experience. "" Learning how to draw content from the Web together into new integrated interfaces and applications, whether for yourself or for other others, is the central concern of this book.

Today, technology is used to shift, sway and change attitudes and behavior. This creates amazing opportunities and challenges for designers. If we want to create products and services that have the power to educate people so they may live better lives, or help to reduce the time people take to do certain tasks, we first need an understanding of how these people think and work - what makes them ""tick""  The premise of this book is the need to understand how people ""behave""; their habits, motivators and drivers, as a critical way to better understand what a great customer experience for your audience looks like, facilitating better design decisions. The book will lead you from understanding behavior, to extracting customer insights that can launch you into the design of something that makes a difference to people's lives - all presented in a fun, practical and non-academic way.

When I quit my day job in the summer of 2006 to bring an idea of mine to life as an Internet startup, I was faced with a huge number of questions and not a lot of clear answers. The excitement of starting a new project was soon tempered by the difficulty of choosing among the dizzying array of possible technical platforms and solutions. While the shelves were full of books focusing on each of the components of a web application, what I really wanted was a look at how all the pieces fit together. Too often, I found books that seemed like annotated versions of Javadocs, with he- ful explanatory notes that setEnabled(boolean enabled) would set the enabled flag. At the other end of the spectrum were abstract architectural tracts that might have made for good reading but certainly didn't give me a head start on the architecture. I wanted to see how these technologies worked when used for nontrivial applications; I wanted to see ugly problems and their solutions--I wanted a look at the source code of a modern web application.

Data Resource Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c308768941?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=100,"Brackett, Michael",Technics Publications,9781935504337.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/4337/9781935504337.jpg,"

Are you struggling with the formal design of your organization's data resource? Do you find yourself forced into generic data architectures and universal data models? Do you find yourself warping the business to fit a purchased application? Do you find yourself pushed into developing physical databases without formal logical design? Do you find disparate data throughout the organization? If the answer to any of these questions is Yes, then you need to read Data Resource Design to help guide you through a formal design process that produces a high quality data resource within a single common data architecture.Most public and private sector organizations do not consistently follow a formal data resource design process that begins with the organization's perception of the business world, proceeds through logical data design, through physical data design, and into implementation. Most organizations charge ahead with physical database implementation, physical package implementation, and other brute-force-physical approaches. The result is a data resource that becomes disparate and does not fully support the organization in its business endeavors.Data Resource Design describes how to formally design an organization's data resource to meet its current and future business information demand. It builds on Data Resource Simplexity, which described how to stop the burgeoning data disparity, and on Data Resource Integration, which described how to understand and resolve an organization's disparate data resource. It describes the concepts, principles, and techniques for building a high quality data resource based on an organization's perception of the business world in which they operate. Like Data Resource Simplexity and Data Resource Integration, Michael Brackett draws on five decades of data management experience building and managing data resources, and resolving disparate data in both public and private sector organizations. He leverages theories, concepts, principles, and techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, such as human dynamics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, and biology, and applies them to properly designing data as a critical resource of an organization. He shows how to understand the business environment where an organization operates and design a data resource that supports the organization in that business environment.

Now covering both conventional and unmanned systems, this is a significant update of the definitive book on aircraft system design Design and Development of Aircraft Systems, Second Edition is for people who want to understand how industry develops the customer requirement into a fully integrated, tested, and qualified product that is safe to fly and fit for purpose. This edition has been updated to take into account the growth of unmanned air vehicles, together with updates to all chapters to bring them in line with current design practice and technologies as taught on courses at BAE Systems and Cranfield, Bristol and Loughborough universities in the UK. Design and Development of Aircraft Systems, Second Edition  Provides a holistic view of aircraft system design describing the interaction between all of the subsystems such as fuel system, navigation, flight control etc. Covers all aspects of design including systems engineering, design drivers, systems architectures, systems integration, modelling of systems, practical considerations, & systems examples. Incorporates essential new material on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).   Design and Development of Aircraft Systems, Second Edition has been written to be generic and not to describe any single process. It aims to complement other volumes in the Wiley Aerospace Series, in particular Aircraft Systems, Third Edition and Civil Avionics Systems by the same authors, and will inform readers of the work that is carried out by engineers in the aerospace industry to produce innovative and challenging - yet safe and reliable - systems and aircraft. Essential reading for Aerospace Engineers.

Given Perl's natural fit for web applications development, it's no surprise that Perl is also a natural choice for web services development. It's the most popular web programming language, with strong implementations of both SOAP and XML-RPC, the leading ways to distribute applications using web services. But books on web services focus on writing these applications in Java or Visual Basic, leaving Perl programmers with few resources to get them started. Programming Web Services with Perl changes that, bringing Perl users all the information they need to create web services using their favorite language.Programming Web Services with Perl steers clear of the hype surrounding web services and concentrates on what is useful and practical. The book introduces the major web services standards, such as XML-RPC, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, and shows how to implement Perl servers and clients using these standards. You'll find detailed references on both the XML and SOAP toolkits, and learn when to use one technology in favor of the other. The book is rich with programming examples that you'll find useful well past the learning stage. And, moving beyond the basics, the book offers solutions to problems of security, authentication, and scalability.Some of the topics covered in the book are: HTTP and XML basicsXML-RPC and the toolkitsSOAP and toolkitsSOAP:: LiteUsing SOAP with SMTP and other protocolsAdvertising and discovering with UDDI and WSDLThe REST methodologyThe future of web servicesProgramming Web Services with Perl was written for Perl programmers who have no prior knowledge of web services. You can pick up this book without any understanding of XML-RPC or SOAP and be able to apply these technologies easily, through the use of publicly available Perl modules detailed in the book.If you're interested in applying XML-RPC and SOAP technologies to distributed programming applications, then Programming Web Services with Perl is a book you'll want to have.

Over the last couple of years, we've noticed that our customers have gotten more demanding when it comes to the usability of their web applications. Inspired by the ""web 2.0"" trend and applications such as Gmail and the like, we've tried many approaches to building these rich Internet applications (RIAs). But all of these had one big flaw: they required us to learn a different language, including adhering to a whole new set of conventions and best practices. Only with the introduction of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) have we begun to feel confident about building this kind of application in a maintainable fashion. This book introduces GWT within the context just described, and will guide you through the first steps of using it to build real-world applications. The goal is to get you as a Java developer up to speed quickly by providing just enough background and a lot of hands-on code samples. During the course of the book, we'll guide you through the different aspects of GWT that we feel are important, and leave out the ones we feel are out-of-scope for beginners. Most of the code samples will gradually build to make up a real-world sample application that allows you to manage your tasks using a web application. After reading this book, you'll be equipped with the necessary knowledge and tools to start building real-world applications using GWT.

Unlike other dry business books, this refreshing, straightforward guide from Logo Design Love author and international designer David Airey answers the questions all designers have when first starting out on their own. In fact, the book was inspired by the many questions David receives every day from the more than 600,000 designers who visit his three blogs (Logo Design Love, Identity Designed, and DavidAirey.com) each month.  How do I find new clients? How much should I charge for my design work? When should I say no to a client? How do I handle difficult clients? What should I be sure to include in my contracts?   David's readers-a passionate and vocal group-regularly ask him these questions and many more on how to launch and run their own design careers. With this book, David finally answers their pressing questions with anecdotes, case studies, and sound advice garnered from his own experience as well as those of such well-known designers as Ivan Chermayeff, Jerry Kuyper, Maggie Macnab, Eric Karjaluoto, and Von Glitschka. Designers just starting out on their own will find this book invaluable in succeeding in today's hyper-networked, global economy.

Web Accessibility,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c109199219?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=102,"Thatcher, Jim",Ingram      ,9781590596388.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6388/9781590596388.jpg,"

The Challenge of Accessibility When Tim Berners-Lee created the Web, he had some very specific goals in mind. Certainly, creating a technology that allowed the sharing of information was a main part of that goal, but an interesting piece of Berners-Lee's vision has always had to do with the human side of the Web. After all, it's not machines that use the Web, but people. Accessibility has become a hot topic in web design, despite the fact that it has always been a part of the original vision. In a broad sense, accessibility simply means ensuring that a given page on the Web is able to be accessed. Accessibility is not about disability; rather, it's about people getting to the shared information that the vision of the Web has made manifest. There has also been a lot said about how accessibility relates to web standards and vice versa. Realistically, accessibility relies on aspects of related web standards, but has in fact become a science, art, and practice of its own. It's a deep specialty, and one that is highly problematic, as what might make a page accessible to one person could conceivably render it inaccessible to another.

Many of today's web development books and articles cover single aspects of the development life cycle, delving only into specific features rather than looking at the whole picture. In this book, we will develop a complete web application. Although we will be using various third-party libraries and tools to aid in development, we will be developing the application from start to finish. The focus of this book is on Web 2. 0, a catchphrase that has been in use for a few years now and is typically used to refer to web sites or web applications that have particular char- teristics. Some of these characteristics include the following: - Correctly using HTML/XHTML, CSS, and other standards - Using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to provide a responsive application without requiring a full refresh of pages - Allowing syndication of web site content using RSS - Adding wikis, blogs, or tags Although not everybody is an advocate of the ""Web 2. 0"" phrase, the term does signify forward progress in web development. And although not everybody has the need to provide a wiki or a blog on their web site, the other characteristics listed (such as correct standards usage) provide a good basis for a web site and should be used by all developers, regardless of how they want their web site or application categorized. I wrote this book because I want to share with other users how I build web sites.

As a web user, you'll no doubt have noticed some of the breathtaking applications available in today's modern web, such as Google Maps and Flickrdesktop applications than the old style web sites you are used to. You've probably also wished that you could create such things, and then thought ""nahhh, I'd need to know a lot of complicated code to be able to even start creating sites like these."" Well, think again.There is a lot of complicated code involved in cutting-edge ""Ajax-style"" web applications, but a lot of the hard work is already done for you, and available on the Web. JavaScript libraries exist to provide most of that Ajax/DOM Scripting functionality out of the box. Application programming interfaces (APIs) exist to allow you to transplant complicated applications such as Google Maps and Flickr right into your own web sites. And hosting services such as Flickr and YouTube provide all you need to store and retrieve your media (be it images, video, or whatever) at your leisure, without having to worry about bandwidth issues and file naming nightmares.All you need to know is enough to successfully wire together all this functionality successfully and responsibly, and this book shows you how. It starts from the very beginning of your journey, showing you what's available, what you need, and how to set up an effective development environment. After a solid base has been built, it shows you how to build up each aspect of your site, including storing, retrieving, and displaying content, adding images and video to your site, building effective site navigation and laying it all out beautifully using CSS, promoting your content so you will attract visitors to your site, and adding special effects to enhance usability and design asthetics...all with ready-made functionality available on the Web!

Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines.  The rules in High Performance Web Sites explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. High Performance Web Sites covers every aspect of that process.  Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book's companion web site. The rules include how to:  Make Fewer HTTP Requests Use a Content Delivery Network Add an Expires Header Gzip Components Put Stylesheets at the Top Put Scripts at the Bottom Avoid CSS Expressions Make JavaScript and CSS External Reduce DNS Lookups Minify JavaScript Avoid Redirects Remove Duplicates Scripts Configure ETags Make Ajax Cacheable  If you're building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable.  ""If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve's guidelines, the Web would be a dramatically better place. Between this book and Steve's YSlow extension, there's really no excuse for having a sluggish web site anymore.""  -Joe Hewitt, Developer of Firebug debugger and Mozilla's DOM Inspector  ""Steve Souders has done a fantastic job of distilling a massive, semi-arcane art down to a set of concise, actionable, pragmatic engineering steps that will change the world of web performance.""  -Eric Lawrence, Developer of the Fiddler Web Debugger, Microsoft Corporation

#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent ""grand design"" of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion--or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity. According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the ""multiverse""--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a ""theory of everything"" the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.

Ajax has gained much attention on the web and provides unique and powerful ways of dealing with data in real-time. It is bringing desktop applications to the browser by providing on demand data transfers without page refreshes and providing feedback to users in a manner that was never achievable in standard web applications. In this book, readers will learn about the technologies used to create Ajax, their importance in the process and how to create a reusable, scalable Ajax engine for professional development. They will learn how to create their own custom Ajax components that can be reused across multiple projects and connected with different data sources, such as databases, xml or other text-based files. They will also learn how to create database connections and multi-user applications while following identified design patterns, exchange data with other technologies, such as PHP and ColdFusion, and implement security into their Ajax applications for practical real world development.

User experience design is the discipline of creating a useful and usable Web site or application that's easily navigated and meets the needs of the site owner and its users. There's a lot more to successful UX design than knowing the latest Web technologies or design trends: It takes diplomacy, management skills, and business savvy. That's where the updated edition of this important book comes in. With new information on design principles, mobile and gestural interactions, content strategy, remote research tools and more, you'll learn to:   Recognize the various roles in UX design, identify stakeholders, and enlist their support Obtain consensus from your team on project objectives Understand approaches such as Waterfall, Agile, and Lean UX Define the scope of your project and avoid mission creep Conduct user research in person or remotely, and document your findings Understand and communicate user behavior with personas Design and prototype your application or site Plan for development, product rollout, and ongoing quality assurance

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are one of the most important technologies on the web today. They give web developers the power to style their web sites so those sites are usable, compact, good looking, consistently displayable, and quick and efficient to change if so desired.There are many books out there on CSS, but Beginning CSS Web Development is different--it doesn't waste time discussing theory, and it delves straight into the practical matter. It provides you with what you need to know, faster. It is also completely up to date, covering the most modern CSS standards and design techniques.In addition to the essential CSS basics, this book covers advanced techniques like accessibility, hacks, and filters. The book concludes with a case study, and features a CSS reference section that allows you to look up required syntax as quickly as possible.

Facilitates both the understanding and adoption of 802.1aq as a networking solution 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) is a technology that greatly simplifies the creation and configuration of carrier, enterprise, and cloud computing networks--by using modern computing power to deprecate signaling, and to integrate multicast, multipath routing, and large-scale virtualization. It is arguably one of the most significant enhancements in Ethernet's history. 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution explains both the ""what"" and the ""why"" of the technology standard being set today. It covers which decisions were elective and which were dictated by the design goals by using a multipart approach that first explains what SPB is, before transitioning into narrative form to describe the design processes and decisions behind it. To make SPB accessible to the data networking professional from multiple perspectives, the book:    Provides a ""Reader's Companion"" to the standard   Dissects the different elements of SPB   Offers applications and potential futures for the technology   802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution will appeal to system implementers, system and network architects, academics, IT professionals, and general networking professionals.

Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.  Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.  Presenting information to visitors from all over the world  Integrating email with your web applications  Planning hardware purchases and hosting options to have as much as you need without breaking your wallet  Partitioning and distributing databases to support large datasets and simultaneous transactions  Monitoring your applications to find and clear bottlenecks  * Providing services APIs and using services from other providers to increase your site's reach and capabilities  Whether you're starting a small web site with hopes of growing big or you already have a large system that needs maintenance, you'll find Building Scalable Web Sites to be a library of ideas for making things work.

MicroCMOS Design covers key analog design methodologies with an emphasis on analog systems that can be integrated into systems-on-chip (SoCs). Starting at the transistor level, this book introduces basic concepts in the design of system-level complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS). It uses practical examples to illustrate circuit construction so that readers can develop an intuitive understanding rather than just assimilate the usual conventional analytical knowledge. As SoCs become increasingly complex, analog/radio frequency (RF) system designers have to master both system- and transistor-level design aspects. They must understand abstract concepts associated with large components, such as analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and phase-locked loops (PLLs). To help readers along, this book discusses topics including:    Amplifier basics & design   Operational amplifier (Opamp)   Data converter basics   Nyquist-rate data converters   Oversampling data converters   High-resolution data converters   PLL basics   Frequency synthesis and clock recovery Focused more on design than analysis, this reference avoids lengthy equations and instead helps readers acquire a more hands-on mastery of the subject based on the application of core design concepts. Offering the needed perspective on the various design techniques for data converter and PLL design, coverage starts with abstract concepts--including discussion of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and MOS transistors--and builds up to an examination of the larger systems derived from microCMOS design.

Discover the techniques behind beautiful design by deconstructing designs to understand them The term 'hacker' has been redefined to consist of anyone who has an insatiable curiosity as to how things work--and how they can try to make them better. This book is aimed at hackers of all skill levels and explains the classical principles and techniques behind beautiful designs by deconstructing those designs in order to understand what makes them so remarkable. Author and designer David Kadavy provides you with the framework for understanding good design and places a special emphasis on interactive mediums. You'll explore color theory, the role of proportion and geometry in design, and the relationship between medium and form. Packed with unique reverse engineering design examples, this book inspires and encourages you to discover and create new beauty in a variety of formats.  Breaks down and studies the classical principles and techniques behind the creation of beautiful design Illustrates cultural and contextual considerations in communicating to a specific audience Discusses why design is important, the purpose of design, the various constraints of design, and how today's fonts are designed with the screen in mind Dissects the elements of color, size, scale, proportion, medium, and form Features a unique range of examples, including the graffiti in the ancient city of Pompeii, the lack of the color black in Monet's art, the style and sleekness of the iPhone, and more  By the end of this book, you'll be able to apply the featured design principles to your own web designs, mobile apps, or other digital work.

Pro HTML5 and CSS3 Design Patterns is a reference book and a cookbook on how to style web pages using CSS3 and HTML5. It contains 350 ready-to-use patterns (CSS3 and HTML5 code snippets) that you can copy and paste into your code. Each pattern can be combined with other patterns to create an unlimited number of solutions, and each pattern works reliably in all major browsers without the need for browser hacks.  The book is completely up-to-date with code, best practices, and browser compatibilities for HTML5 and CSS3--enabling you to dive in and make use of these new technologies in production environments.  Pro HTML5 and CSS3 Design Patterns is so much more than just a cookbook, though! It systematically covers every usable feature of CSS3 and combines these features with HTML5 to create reusable patterns. Each pattern has an intuitive name to make it easy to find, remember, and refer to. Accessibility and best practices are carefully engineered into each design pattern, example, and source code.  The book's layout, with a pattern's example on the left page and its explanation on the right, makes it easy to find a pattern and study it without having to flip between pages. The book is also readable from cover to cover, with topics building carefully upon previous topics.  Pro HTML5 and CSS3 Design Patterns book unleashes your productivity and creativity in web design and development. Instead of hacking your way toward a solution, you'll learn how to predictably create successful designs every time by reusing and combining modular design patterns.

Rigorously test and improve the security of all your Web software!     It's as certain as death and taxes: hackers will mercilessly attack your Web sites, applications, and services. If you're vulnerable, you'd better discover these attacks yourself, before the black hats do. Now, there's a definitive, hands-on guide to security-testing any Web-based software: How to Break Web Software.   In this book, two renowned experts address every category of Web software exploit: attacks on clients, servers, state, user inputs, and more. You'll master powerful attack tools and techniques as you uncover dozens of crucial, widely exploited flaws in Web architecture and coding. The authors reveal where to look for potential threats and attack vectors, how to rigorously test for each of them, and how to mitigate the problems you find. Coverage includes   - Client vulnerabilities, including attacks on client-side validation - State-based attacks: hidden fields, CGI parameters, cookie poisoning, URL jumping, and session hijacking - Attacks on user-supplied inputs: cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and directory traversal - Language- and technology-based attacks: buffer overflows, canonicalization, and NULL string attacks - Server attacks: SQL Injection with stored procedures, command injection, and server fingerprinting - Cryptography, privacy, and attacks on Web services  Your Web software is mission-critical-it can't be compromised. Whether you're a developer, tester, QA specialist, or IT manager, this book will help you protect that software-systematically.

There is no such thing as ""perfect security"" when it comes to keeping all systems intact and functioning properly. Good penetration (pen) testing creates a balance that allows a system to be secure while simultaneously being fully functional. With this book, you'll learn how to become an effective penetrator (i.e., a white hat or ethical hacker) in order to circumvent the security features of a Web application so that those features can be accurately evaluated and adequate security precautions can be put in place.  After a review of the basics of web applications, you'll be introduced to web application hacking concepts and techniques such as vulnerability analysis, attack simulation, results analysis, manuals, source code, and circuit diagrams. These web application hacking concepts and techniques will prove useful information for ultimately securing the resources that need your protection.  What you will learn from this book * Surveillance techniques that an attacker uses when targeting a system for a strike * Various types of issues that exist within the modern day web application space * How to audit web services in order to assess areas of risk and exposure * How to analyze your results and translate them into documentation that is useful for remediation * Techniques for pen-testing trials to practice before a live project  Who this book is for  This book is for programmers, developers, and information security professionals who want to become familiar with web application security and how to audit it.  Wrox Professional guides are planned and written by working programmers to meet the real-world needs of programmers, developers, and IT professionals. Focused and relevant, they address the issues technology professionals face every day. They provide examples, practical solutions, and expert education in new technologies, all designed to help programmers do a better job.

Agile Data Warehouse Design is a step-by-step guide for capturing data warehousing/business intelligence (DW/BI) requirements and turning them into high performance dimensional models in the most direct way: by modelstorming (data modeling + brainstorming) with BI stakeholders. This book describes BEAM✲, an agile approach to dimensional modeling, for improving communication between data warehouse designers, BI stakeholders and the whole DW/BI development team. BEAM✲ provides tools and techniques that will encourage DW/BI designers and developers to move away from their keyboards and entity relationship based tools and model interactively with their colleagues. The result is everyone thinks dimensionally from the outset! Developers understand how to efficiently implement dimensional modeling solutions. Business stakeholders feel ownership of the data warehouse they have created, and can already imagine how they will use it to answer their business questions. Within this book, you will learn: ✲ Agile dimensional modeling using Business Event Analysis & Modeling (BEAM✲) ✲ Modelstorming: data modeling that is quicker, more inclusive, more productive, and frankly more fun! ✲ Telling dimensional data stories using the 7Ws (who, what, when, where, how many, why and how) ✲ Modeling by example not abstraction; using data story themes, not crow's feet, to describe detail ✲ Storyboarding the data warehouse to discover conformed dimensions and plan iterative development ✲ Visual modeling: sketching timelines, charts and grids to model complex process measurement - simply ✲ Agile design documentation: enhancing star schemas with BEAM✲ dimensional shorthand notation ✲ Solving difficult DW/BI performance and usability problems with proven dimensional design patterns Lawrence Corr is a data warehouse designer and educator. As Principal of DecisionOne Consulting, he helps clients to review and simplify their data warehouse designs, and advises vendors on visual data modeling techniques. He regularly teaches agile dimensional modeling courses worldwide and has taught dimensional DW/BI skills to thousands of students. Jim Stagnitto is a data warehouse and master data management architect specializing in the healthcare, financial services, and information service industries. He is the founder of the data warehousing and data mining consulting firm Llumino.

In order to establish and then maintain a successful presence on the Web, designing a creative site is only half the battle. What good is an intricate Web infrastructure if you're unable to measure its effectiveness? That's why every business is desperate for feedback on their site's visitors: Who are they? Why do they visit? What information or service is most valuable to them?  Unfortunately, most common Web analytics software applications are long on functionality and short on documentation. Without clear guidance on how these applications should be integrated into the greater Web strategy, these often expensive investments go underused and underappreciated.  Enter Web Site Measurement Hacks, a guidebook that helps you understand your Web site visitors and how they contribute to your business's success.

""Ryan Barnett has raised the bar in terms of running Apache securely. If you run Apache, stop right now and leaf through this book; you need this information."" -- Stephen Northcutt, The SANS Institute The only end-to-end guide to securing Apache Web servers and Web applications Apache can be hacked. As companies have improved perimeter security, hackers have increasingly focused on attacking Apache Web servers and Web applications. Firewalls and SSL won't protect you: you must systematically harden your Web application environment. Preventing Web Attacks with Apache brings together all the information you'll need to do that: step-by-step guidance, hands-on examples, and tested configuration files. Building on his groundbreaking SANS presentations on Apache security, Ryan C. Barnett reveals why your Web servers represent such a compelling target, how significant exploits are performed, and how they can be defended against. Exploits discussed include: buffer overflows, denial of service, attacks on vulnerable scripts and programs, credential sniffing and spoofing, client parameter manipulation, brute force attacks, web defacements, and more. Barnett introduces the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmarks, a set of best-practice Apache security configuration actions and settings he helped to create. He addresses issues related to IT processes and your underlying OS; Apache downloading, installation, and configuration; application hardening; monitoring, and more. He also presents a chapter-length case study using actual Web attack logs and data captured ""in the wild."" For every sysadmin, Web professional, and security specialist responsible for Apache or Web application security. With this book, you will learn to * Address the OS-related flaws most likely to compromise Web server security * Perform security-related tasks needed to safely download, configure, and install Apache * Lock down your Apache httpd.conf file and install

With the help of the Internet and accompanying tools, creating and publishing online maps has become easier and rich with options. A city guide web site can use maps to show the location of restaurants, museums, and art venues. A business can post a map for reaching its offices. The state government can present a map showing average income by area. Developers who want to publish maps on the web often discover that commercial tools cost too much and hunting down the free tools scattered across Internet can use up too much of your time and resources. Web Mapping Illustrated shows you how to create maps, even interactive maps, with free tools, including MapServer, OpenEV, GDAL/OGR, and PostGIS. It also explains how to find, collect, understand, use, and share mapping data, both over the traditional Web and using OGC-standard services like WFS and WMS. Mapping is a growing field that goes beyond collecting and analyzing GIS data. Web Mapping Illustrated shows how to combine free geographic data, GPS, and data management tools into one resource for your mapping information needs so you don't have to lose your way while searching for it. Remember the fun you had exploring the world with maps? Experience the fun again with Web Mapping Illustrated. This book will take you on a direct route to creating valuable maps.

Browsing for information is a significant part of most research activity, but many online collections hamper browsing with interfaces that are variants on a search box. Research shows that rich-prospect interfaces can offer an intuitive and highly flexible alternative environment for information browsing, assisting hypothesis formation and pattern-finding. This unique book offers a clear discussion of this form of interface design, including a theoretical basis for why it is important, and examples of how it can be done. It will be of interest to those working in the fields of library and information science, human-computer interaction, visual communication design, and the digital humanities as well as those interested in new theories and practices for designing web interfaces for library collections, digitized cultural heritage materials, and other types of digital collections.

A practical and concise book that teaches XML from the ground up. This tutorial style presents various XML methodologies and techniques in an easy to understand way, building a basis for further exploration.XML is essentially an enabling technology, dry and boring on its own. As a result, most books on the market are dry, and academic in nature teaching theory rather than practice. This book actually teaches practical, real-world applications of XML, using the very latest version of PHP (PHP 5) as the base language .No Nonsense XML Web Development with PHP explains how XML can be put to use in real-world projects. The book also covers buzz topics such as RSS and Web Services. From the PublisherIf ever there were a candidate for ""Most Hyped Technology' it would be Extensible Markup Language (XML). 'No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP' cuts through the hype and shows you how to get the most of this powerful, multifaceted technology.No Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP dispenses with the theoretical possibilities of XML and presents real, practical uses of XML that you can apply to your existing Websites today. The book will teach you, step-by-step, exactly how to: Create a full-blown Content Management System (CMS) based on XML.Create a dynamic site map using XSLT.Generate XML feeds (including RSS) for your Website.Facilitate transfer of important information between disparate systems using XML-RPCUse the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate documents.Rapidly process XML using PHP 5.0's built-in SimpleXML functionality.Unlike other dry, boring, theoretical writing on XML, this book doesn't cover the entire spectrum of XML technologies; it covers practical uses of XML that are useful to Web developers right now.This book is designed to help you to get your feet (and perhaps your ankles, shins, and knees) wet with the topic of XML. You can instantly test out and apply the code examples provided in the book (and available for free download) to get a hands-on feel for the technology, and you'll gain the confidence to go out and build more.The XML-powered content management system (CMS) that you'll build will be a complete, ready-to-use application. It draws on the author's experience of building XML-poweredWho Should Read This Book?No-Nonsense XML Web Development With PHP is ideal for Web developers who want to discover what can be done using XML, whether they be experienced with PHP or relative newcomers. All that's needed to get started is a good understanding of HTML and some experience with PHP.The book is written in the usual SitePoint style: it's clear and fun to read, with plenty of blocks of example code that you can apply immediately to your own Websites.There's no need to re-type any of the code from the book. As always, all customers will receive instant download access to all the code and files used in the book so you can apply them immediately to your own projects.What Slashdot.org Says...""Kudos to the author for writing chapters on XML without sounding boring, redundant or too academic. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in developing PHP-driven Web sites that provide or consume Web services, work with XML data or generate XML for others to use.""

Technological advances in hardware and software provide powerful tools with the potential to design interfaces that are powerful and easy to use. Yet, the frustrations and convoluted ""work-arounds"" often encountered make it clear that there is substantial room for improvement. Drawn from more than 60 years of combined experience studying, implementing, and teaching about performance in human-technology systems, Display and Interface Design: Subtle Science, Exact Art provides a theoretically-based yet practical guide for ecological display and interface design. Written from the perspective of cognitive systems engineering and ecological interface design, the book delineates how to design interfaces tailored to specific work demands, leverage the powerful perception-action skills of the human, and use powerful interface technologies wisely. This triadic approach (domain, human, interface) to display and interface design stands in sharp contrast to traditional dyadic (human, interface) approaches. The authors describe general principles and specific strategies at length and include concrete examples and extensive design tutorials that illustrate quite clearly how these principles and strategies can be applied. The coverage spans the entire continuum of interfaces that might need to be developed in today's work places.  The reason that good interfaces are few and far between is really quite simple: they are extremely difficult to design and build properly. While there are many books available that address display design, most of them focus on aesthetic principles but lack scientific rigor, or are descriptive but not prescriptive. Whether you are exploring the principles of interface design or designing and implementing interfaces, this book elucidates an overarching framework for design that can be applied to the broad spectrum of existing domains.

Most web design books concentrate on a single technology or piece of software, leaving the designer to figure out how to put all the pieces together. This book is different. Web Designer's Reference provides a truly integrated approach to web design. Each of the dozen chapters covers a specific aspect of creating a web page, such as working with typography, adding images, creating navigation, and crafting CSS layouts. In each case, relevant XHTML elements are explored along with associated CSS, and visual design ideas are discussed. Several practical examples are provided, which you can use to further your understanding of each subject. This highly modular and integrated approach means that you learn about technologies in context, at the appropriate time and, upon working through each chapter, you craft a number of web page elements that you can use on countless sites in the future.This book is ideal for those making their first moves into standards-based web design, experienced designers who want to learn about modern design techniques and move toward creating CSS layouts, graphic designers who want to discover how to lay out their designs, and veteran web designers who want a concise reference guide.The book's advocacy of web standards, usability, and accessibility with a strong eye toward visual design means it is of use to technologists and designers alike, enabling everyone to build better websites. And for those moments when a particular tag or property value slips your mind, the book provides a comprehensive reference guide that includes important and relevant XHTML elements and attributes, XHTML entities, web colors, and CSS 2.1 properties and values.

Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns is all about showing you how to use the power of design patterns and core design principles in real ASP.NET applications. The goal of this book is to educate developers on the fundamentals of object oriented programming, design patterns, principles, and methodologies that can help you become a better programmer. Design patterns and principles enable loosely coupled and highly cohesive code, which will improve your code's readability, flexibility, and maintenance. Each chapter addresses a layer in an enterprise ASP.NET application and shows how proven patterns, principles, and best practices can be leveraged to solve problems and improve the design of your code. In addition, a professional-level, end-to-end case study is used to show how to use best practice design patterns and principles in a real website.  Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns is for ASP.NET developers who are comfortable with the .NET framework but are looking to improve how they code and understand why design patterns, design principles, and best practices will make their code more maintainable and adaptable. Readers who have had experience with design patterns before may wish to skip Part 1 of the book, which acts as an introduction to the Gang of Four design patterns and common design principles, including the S.O.L.I.D. principles and Martin Fowler's enterprise patterns. All code samples are written in C# but the concepts can be applied very easily to VB.NET. This book covers well-known patterns and best practices for developing enterprise-level ASP.NET applications. The patterns used can be applied to any version of ASP.NET from 1.0 to 4.0. The patterns themselves are language agnostic and can be applied to any object oriented programming language. Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns can be used both as a step-by-step guide and as a continuous source of reference to dip into at your leisure. The book is broken into three distinct sections. Part 1 is an introduction to patterns and design principles. Part 2 examines how patterns and principles can be used in the various layers of an ASP.NET application. Part 3 represents an end-to-end case study showcasing many of the patterns covered in the book. You may find it useful to work through the chapters before reading the case study, or you may find it easier to see the patterns in action by reading the case study section first and referring back to Part 2 for a more detailed view on the patterns and principles used. Within those parts the coverage includes:   The origins of the Gang of Four design patterns, their relevance in today's world, and their decoupling from specific programming languages. An overview of some common design principles and the S.O.L.I.D. design principles follows, and the chapter ends with a description of Fowler's enterprise patterns. Layering Your Application and Separating Your Concerns A description of the Transaction Script pattern followed by the Active Record, with an exercise to demonstrate the pattern using the Castle Windsor project. The Domain Model pattern demonstrated in an exercise with NHibernate and a review of the domain-driven design (DDD) methodology Patterns and principles that can be used construct your objects and how to make sure that you are building your application for scalability and maintainability: Factory, Decorator, Template, State, Strategy, Composite, Specification and Layer Supertype. Design principles that can improve your code's maintainability and flexibility; these include Dependency Injection, Interface Segregation, and Liskov Substitution Principle Service Oriented Architecture, the Facade design pattern, messaging patterns such as Document Message, Request-Response, Reservation, and the Idempotent pattern The Data Access Layer: Two data access strategies are demonstrated to help organize your persistence layer: Repository and Data Access Objects.

The goal of this book is to serve as a design/idea book. Our mantra is that simplicity leads to great results. Small Web Sites, Great Results will show readers basic strategy and introduce them to the philosophy of doing more with less. The book features design guidelines to make sites look professional even on a small scale, techniques to get the hits from search engines, and more. Users will learn to construct a holistic Web presence that garners real results. An added benefit of this concept is that along with the book there is a simple Web site system, a series of pages, and scripts which will accommodate the principles presented in the book. Users may go to the site, download the frameworks, and instantly post them for their own use.

Real World Web Services,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c410251227?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=117,"Iverson, Will",Oreilly &   ,9780596006426.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6426/9780596006426.jpg,"

The core idea behind Real World Web Services is simple: after years of hype, what are the major players really doing with web services? Standard bodies may wrangle and platform vendors may preach, but at the end of the day what are the technologies that are actually in use, and how can developers incorporate them into their own applications? Those are the answers Real World Web Services delivers. It's a field guide to the wild and wooly world of non-trivial deployed web services.The heart of the book is a series of projects, demonstrating the use and integration of Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and many more web services. Some of these vendors have been extremely successful with their web service deployments: for example, eBay processes over a billion web service requests a month!The author focuses on building 8 fully worked out example web applications that incorporate the best web services available today. The book thoroughly documents how to add functionality like automating listings for auctions, dynamically calculating shipping fees, automatically sending faxes to your suppliers, using an aggregator to pull data from multiple news and web service feeds into a single format or monitoring the latest weblog discussions and Google searches to keep web site visitors on top of topics of interest-by integrating APIs from popular websites most people are already familiar with.For each example application, the author provides a thorough overview, architecture, and full working code examples.This book doesn't engage in an intellectual debate as to the correctness of web services on a theological level. Instead, it focuses on the practical, real world usage of web services as the latest evolution in distributed computing, allowing for structured communication via Internet protocols. As you ll see, this includes everything from sending HTTP GET commands to retrieving an XML document through the use of SOAP and various vendor SDKs.

網頁≠網路產品

HTML+CSS≠良好的使用流程

掌握這精髓，朝網路產品設計師的道路邁進吧！

	 

	網頁已經不再只是使用者與網路交流的唯一媒介，我們每天用的手機應用程式，例如Facebook、Twitter、Pinterest，也是網路交流的一部分。這些與網路有關的「產品」，就是「網路產品」。

	 

	網路產品要的不只是外觀漂亮、效果酷炫，讓使用者感覺不到背後的流程運作，還會想重複使用，這才算的上是成功的使用者體驗。因此，拋開過去只侷限在「網頁設計」、「UI設計」、「UX設計」的思考範圍吧，要製造出成功的網路產品，你必須像個產品設計師一樣思考。

	 

	Etsy是Alexa排名的全球前兩百大、美國前五十大網站，要能每個月成交上千萬筆訂單，必須要設計出讓這千萬名使用者都流暢的瀏覽過程。蘭迪．杭特以Etsy創意總監的自身經驗，介紹要以產品設計師的角度思考，該具備何種思維、技能、工具，並解釋使用者在網路瀏覽過程中的感受。

	 

	如果你還不確定成為一名網路產品設計師需要注意哪些細節，如果想知道如何讓使用者更常使用你的網路產品，這本書絕對是你迎接新思維的最佳入門解說。

	我們不設計網頁，我們設計讓你感覺順暢的體驗過程

THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT THINKERS--A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent ""grand design"" of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion--or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet--if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the ""top-down"" approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the ""multiverse""--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a ""model-dependent"" theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete ""theory of everything."" If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason. A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform--and provoke--like no other.

Integrating physical modeling, mathematical analysis, and computer simulation, Instrumentation Design Studies explores a wide variety of specific and practical instrumentation design situations. The author uses MATLAB(R) and SIMULINK(R) for dynamic system simulation, Minitab(R) for statistical applications, and Mathcad for general engineering computations. Rather than consult the extensive manuals of these software packages, readers can access handy, sharply focused material in the appendices to assist in comprehension.After introducing the techniques behind the design of experiments (DOE), the book discusses several technologies for implementing vibration isolation, the design of a high-accuracy pressure transducer, and the use of cold-wire thermometers for measuring rapidly fluctuating fluid temperatures. It then focuses on a basic piezoelectric actuator that provides translational motions up to about 1mm full scale with nanometer resolution, before covering instruments used to measure the viscosity of liquids as well as two special classes of microphones (infrasonic and ultrasonic) and their important specialized applications. The book also presents statistical tools, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, for experiments; the design and applications of thrust stands for measuring vector forces and torques; and the analysis and simulation of a shock calibrator. It concludes with a discussion of how shock testing machines can help reduce or prevent mechanical failures.Spanning system dynamics, measurement, and control, this book addresses the needs of practicing engineers working in instrumentation fields. It focuses on instruments for various applications, from geophysics to mechanical and aerospace engineering.

Readme This is a book about building apps with good design, parsimonious code and aesthetic appeal on the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch. At times, this book references code and give sample projects; other times, it delves into interaction and visual design. It doesn't take a CS doctorate to appreciate or even understand, but some familiarity with programming is assumed. Who is this book for? Lots of people. Mac developers looking to do a killer iPhone app might want to know the hard-won lessons or philosophies of others; iPhone hackers looking to step up their game might be trying to figure out how much to emulate Apple. Anyone who appreciates a success story will hopefully enjoy this book, but it's also inspirational. How technical is it? Parts of this book assumes basic knowledge of C or other object-oriented programming languages. In some cases, we reference specific Apple frameworks and interface guidelines. It will also help to be familiar with the Apple environment, from the quirks of the App Store to technologies inside OS X. How were these interviewees chosen? The five core chapters of this book are based on a series of interviews with five of the 2009 winners of Apple Design Awards (ADAs) for the iPhone. MLB.com, the makers of the sixth ADA winner, MLB.com at Bat, did not consent to be interviewed for this book in order to protect their intellectual property.

Over the last decades an ever growing demand for wireless localization systems for many different indoor and outdoor application scenarios could be observed. Applications range from crane and fork-lift positioning to RFID-like asset tracking and access control and many more. Especially indoor applications show severe performance degradation due to heavy multipath effects. Since the resolution of wireless localization systems for all kinds of modulation techniques is proportional to the applied signal bandwidth, systems using ultra-wideband signals offer an excellent potential for accurate indoor positioning. With the accredited bandwidth for UWB systems, an accuracy in the range of a few centimeters is possible. This thesis presents the analysis and design of a pulsed frequency modulated ultra-wideband system for high precision local positioning. Up to now, all commercial available systems are based on the usage of very narrow pulses to generate ultra-wideband signals. To overcome typical limitations of the pure impulse UWB technology, a novel system concept is presented in this work. It combines pulse technology with frequency modulated continuous wave radar technology by chopping the FMCW signal into short pulses. On the one hand this fulfills the UWB regulation requirements, and on the other hand precise control of the signal shape is given for the whole bandwidth. This allows the use of advanced synchronization and distance measurement approaches. The main emphasis of this work is the investigation and realization of this pulsed frequency modulated UWB positioning system. The PFM-UWB system is based on a well-known LPR system, which is extended to an UWB system. Theoretical calculations, simulations and measurements are used to define the system and evaluate its performance. With an implemented demonstrator system, a high accuracy in dense multipath indoor environments can be achieved. Conclusive measurements, that demonstrate the abilities of the developed positioning system, round off this work.

Adaptive Phy-Mac Design for Broadband Wireless Systems,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c004195704?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=123,"Ramjee,Prasad",River Publishers,9788792329080.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9080/9788792329080.jpg,"

The next generation mobile communication networks (4G) have the challenging target of providing a peak data rate of 1 Gigabit per second local area and 100 Megabit per second wide area. The ability to offer such high data rates in 100MHz bandwidth requires a very high spectral efficiency and, hence, the need for multi-antenna techniques (MIMO) with spatial multiplexing, fast dynamic link adaptation and packet scheduling, wideband access techniques, and most likely non-contention based spectrum sharing among multiple operators. Many of these required technology components and techniques are well researched and established. Adaptive PHY-MAC Design for Broadband Wireless Systems explains how one can integrate and optimize their use in providing the target cell data rates with high availability. The authors address the ability to cope with interference and enhanced physical layer processing and, simultaneously, with the multifaceted system level design. This book also focuses on the selection of technology components and techniques, which leads to the highest spectral efficiency and peak data rate availability with reasonable Quality of Service (QoS) support, such as improved outage scenario, reduced delay, guaranteed bit rate, etc.In short, this book will answer questions such as how individual techniques relate to each other, how can we benefit the gains by suitable combinations of different technologies, and how to choose different technological solutions in different scenarios, etc.

On the surface, design practices and data science may not seem like obvious partners. But these disciplines actually work toward the same goal, helping designers and product managers understand users so they can craft elegant digital experiences. While data can enhance design, design can bring deeper meaning to data.This practical guide shows you how to conduct data-driven A/B testing for making design decisions on everything from small tweaks to large-scale UX concepts. Complete with real-world examples, this book shows you how to make data-driven design part of your product design workflow.Understand the relationship between data, business, and designGet a firm grounding in data, data types, and components of A/B testingUse an experimentation framework to define opportunities, formulate hypotheses, and test different optionsCreate hypotheses that connect to key metrics and business goalsDesign proposed solutions for hypotheses that are most promisingInterpret the results of an A/B test and determine your next move

所謂Web，乃是全球資訊網(World Wide Web)的簡稱。至於Web程式設計，指的就是在網際網路上設計網頁程式。目前，Web程式設計可以說是世界上最熱門的一件工作。一個完整的Web程式設計應該包括下面四大特色：(1) 靜態網頁(2) Client-Side Scripting動態網頁(3) Server-Side Scripting動態網頁(4) Web Service坊間有不少關於Web程式設計的書，但這些書都只適合工具書或參考書，而無法拿來當教科書之用。說它們不適合當作教科書，主要原因是它們每一本書都只有針對上述四大特色中的一項或兩項提出探討，而無法給與全面性Web程式設計的概念。為了達到大專院校Web程式設計教科書的目標，本書特別將Web程式設計的四大特色，深入淺出地整合在一起討論。使用本書當作教材，不但學生們容易進入門檻，老師也可以勝任愉快。

Programming Web Services with XML-RPC,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c010134146?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=124,"Simon St,Laurent",O'Reilly Media,9780596001193.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/1193/9780596001193.jpg,"

Have you ever needed to share processing between two or more computers running programs written in different languages on different operating systems? Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.Programming Web Services with XML-RPC covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers. And if you want to build your own XML-RPC implementation for another environment, the detailed explanations in this book will serve as a foundation for that work.

Introduction By the time you read this, the number applications on the App Store will have crossed the 100,000 mark. Chances are that if you come up with an idea for an app, it's already on the Store and in abundance. In order to catch users' interest, you'll have to differentiate yours. Most developers seem to take the easy route by simply lowering their price. The problem is that it's so easy to do that everybody can do it. And if they do, you've gained nothing. On the contrary, you've lost an income that could possibly motivate you to keep improving and updating your app and thereby sustain your name as a reliable developer users can trust their investment to. If you choose to take the difficult route, however, and differentiate on quality--the route that not everybody can take--you'll not only become a better developer but also earn the respect from other developers and users who'll be willing to spend real time and money on your app. The ten authors of this book have all released successful apps and can testify to how going that extra mile, or ten, has paid off in many aspects of their lives as iPhone developers. By reading their takes on how to make an app stand out from the rest, you'll gain some of the inspiration and insight that could make your app the one in its category that users will want.

There are many reasons for serving up dynamic content from a web site: to offer an online shopping site, create customized information pages for users, or just manage a large volume of content through a database. Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the background and tools to do the job safely and reliably. Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL, Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world applications. It goes into detail on such practical issues as validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks like?), logging in users, and using templates to give your dynamic web pages a standard look. But this book goes even further. It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools. Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking. Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software that are still in widespread use. This new edition has been redesigned around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics include: Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix(R), Windows(R), and Mac OS(R) X systems Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency User input validation, security, and authentication The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes Production of PDF reports

Today, embedded systems are widely deployed in just about every piece of machinery from toasters to spacecrafts, and embedded system designers face many challenges. They are asked to produce increasingly complex systems using the latest technologies, but these technologies are changing faster than ever. They are asked to produce better quality designs with a shorter time-to-market. They are asked to implement increasingly complex functionality but, more importantly, to satisfy numerous other constraints. To achieve these current goals, the designer must be aware of such design constraints and, more importantly, the factors that have a direct effect on them.One of the challenges facing embedded system designers is the selection of the optimum processor for the application in hand: single-purpose, general-purpose, or application specific. Microcontrollers are one member of the family of the application specific processors.Digital System Design concentrates on the use of a microcontroller as the embedded system's processor and how to use it in many embedded system applications. The book covers both the hardware and software aspects needed to design using microcontrollers and is ideal for undergraduate students and engineers that are working in the field of digital system design.

Java Web Services in a Nutshell is a high-speed tutorial and a quick reference for the technologies that Sun Microsystems is creating for implementing web services with Java. This book is a succinct introduction and handy reference to the Java/XML APIs, more commonly known as the JWSDP or ""Java Web Services Development Pack."" These APIs are taking the Java world by storm, as they are capable of handling everything from simple XML to SOAP to full ebXML vocabularies.Although ""web services"" technology has suffered from much hype and overly grand expectations, there is plenty of solid development going on, especially in extending enterprise applications, and a huge amount of this development is being done in Java. As a result, the J2EE APIs for web services are evolving rapidly, and this new ""in a Nutshell"" book covers them all in depth.One of the most important APIs in the JWSDP is JAX-RPC (Java API for XML-based RPC). It's also the API that developers most consistently post questions about. Java Web Services in a Nutshell covers all aspects of JAX-RPC in detail, with tutorial coverage alone exceeding 150 pages. This book offers developers everything they need to program with JAX-RPC.Java Web Services in a Nutshell begins with an introduction to Java web services, including a discussion of how they differ from web applications. The author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web services, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as the means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters cover: JAX-RPCSOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)Reliable SOAP messaging with JAXMWSDLAdvanced JAX-RPCJAXR, the XML-based registry APIWeb Services ToolsThe balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference containing documentation for the various API packages.Intended for Java developers who need to implement Java services or who need their applications to access existing web services, Java Web Services in a Nutshell delivers practical information to help developers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized official documentation. If web services and Enterprise Java are any part of your job description -- of if you'd like them to be -- you'll want this book close beside as you work.

On the World Wide Web, speed and efficiency are vital. Users have little patience for slow web pages, while network administrators want to make the most of their available bandwidth. A properly designed web cache reduces network traffic and improves access times to popular web sites--a boon to network administrators and web users alike.Web Caching hands you all the technical information you need to design, deploy, and operate an effective web caching service. It starts with the basics of how web caching works, from the HTTP headers that govern cachability to cache validation and replacement algorithms.Topics covered in this book include: Designing an effective cache solutionConfiguring web browsers to use a cacheSetting up a collection of caches that can talk to each otherConfiguring an interception cache or proxyMonitoring and fine-tuning the performance of a cacheConfiguring web servers to cooperate with web cachesBenchmarking cache productsThe book also covers the important political aspects of web caching, including privacy, intellectual property, and security issues.Internet service providers, large corporations, or educational institutions--in short, any network that provides connectivity to a wide variety of users--can reap enormous benefit from running a well-tuned web caching service. Web Caching shows you how to do it right.

So you want to make a video game. Where do you start? What do you need to learn? To whom can you look for help? If you've ever asked any of these questions, you'll know how difficult it is to find the answers. I asked myself these same questions many years ago in a little village outside of Bangalore, India, where I was teaching programming and interactive media at an international school. All my students were playing games and they all wanted to create games, but there were no comp- hensive books or online resources available on how to do this. A little bit of research turned up something surprising: not only did basic game design require relatively little programming knowledge but the same set of techniques could also be used over and over again in different contexts to create completely different kinds of games. It was fun to do, the results were immediate, and it was a great creative outlet. The result of this research was an in-house textbook on game design that formed the basis of three high school-level courses and inspired the writing of this book.

Any company using .NET will eventually (if it hasn't already) expose part of its functionality as a .NET Web service, and securing these features will become job number one. Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform is a comprehensive treatment on how to secure Web services on the .NET platform. This book specifically focuses on Web services security, not general .NET security. Authors Brian Nantz and Laurence Moroney lay the foundation for a complete discussion of Web services security in the .NET platform by first describing the key aspects of security for the Windows operating system, Internet Information Services, and ASP.NET. They show developers how to use the WS-Security W3C specifications for industry-standard authentication, encryption, authorization, XML signature, attachments, and routing with Web services. The specific working code examples and clear-cut explanations will assist developers in readily integrating Web services security into their applications.

The web services architecture provides a new way to think about and implement application-to-application integration and interoperability that makes the development platform irrelevant. Two applications, regardless of operating system, programming language, or any other technical implementation detail, communicate using XML messages over open Internet protocols such as HTTP or SMTP. The Simple Open Access Protocol (SOAP) is a specification that details how to encode that information and has become the messaging protocol of choice for Web services.Programming Web Services with SOAP is a detailed guide to using SOAP and other leading web services standards--WSDL (Web Service Description Language), and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration protocol). You'll learn the concepts of the web services architecture and get practical advice on building and deploying web services in the enterprise.This authoritative book decodes the standards, explaining the concepts and implementation in a clear, concise style. You'll also learn about the major toolkits for building and deploying web services. Examples in Java, Perl, C#, and Visual Basic illustrate the principles. Significant applications developed using Java and Perl on the Apache Tomcat web platform address real issues such as security, debugging, and interoperability.Covered topic areas include: The Web Services ArchitectureSOAP envelopes, headers, and encodingsWSDL and UDDIWriting web services with Apache SOAP and JavaWriting web services with Perl's SOAP:: LitePeer-to-peer (P2P) web servicesEnterprise issues such as authentication, security, and identityUp-and-coming standards projects for web servicesProgramming Web Services with SOAP provides you with all the information on the standards, protocols, and toolkits you'll need to integrate information services with SOAP. You'll find a solid core of information that will help you develop individual Web services or discover new ways to integrate core business processes across an enterprise.

As long as there's been a Web, people have been trying to make it faster. The maturation of the Web has meant more users, more data, more features, and consequently longer waits on the Web. Improved performance has become a critical factor in determining the usability of the Web in general and of individual sites in particular.Web Performance Tuning, 2nd Edition is about getting the best possible performance from the Web. This book isn't just about tuning web server software; it's also about streamlining web content, getting optimal performance from a browser, tuning both client and server hardware, and maximizing the capacity of the network itself.Web Performance Tuning hits the ground running, giving concrete advice for quick results -- the ""blunt instruments"" for improving crippled performance right away. The book then shifts gears to give a conceptual background of the principles of computing performance. The latter half of the book examines each element of a web transaction -- from client to network to server -- to find the weak links in the chain and show how to strengthen them.In this second edition, the book has been significantly expanded to include: New chapters on Web site architecture, security, reliability, and their impact on performanceDetailed discussion of scalability of Java on multi-processor serversPerl scripts for writing web performance spiders that handle logins, cookies, SSL, and moreDetailed instructions on how to use Perl DBI and the open source program gnuplot to generate performance graphs on the flyCoverage of rstat, a Unix-based open source utility for gathering performance statistics remotelyIn addition, the book includes many more examples and graphs of real-world performance problems and their solutions, and has been updated for Java 2.This book is for anyone who has waited too long for a web page to display, or watched the servers they manage slow to a crawl. It's about making the Web more usable for everyone.

What Is This Book About? This is a book about Web Services. Web Services are still more like a movement than a mature technology. The movement is motivated by a vision of a semi-auto- mated Web that can support long chains of interactions between autonomous agents. There are three important components to that vision. One is interoperabil- ity: a service can have clients (agents) from any platform, in any language. Another is autonomy: an agent can discover the services it needs from their published descriptions that include both what the service can do and how it does it (the interfaces of available actions). The third is (semi) automatic code creation: one description can be used by a development framework to automate the creation of code for clients and by the services themselves. As of today, interoperability is close to full realization, with only occasional glitches; autonomy is a distant vision; but it still has problems. Interoperability has been achieved code creation is useful in part by using an XML-based high-level protocol (SOAP) for message exchanges between clients and services. As long as the client can produce messages in the right format, it doesn't matter what language they're written in or on what platform they run. The first three chapters of our book show how to write platform-independent Web Services clients in Javascript and Java running from within a browser (IE6 or Mozilla).

Web services are poised to become a key technology for a wide range of Internet-enabled applications, spanning everything from straight B2B systems to mobile devices and proprietary in-house software. While there are several tools and platforms that can be used for building web services, developers are finding a powerful tool in Microsoft's .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET. Designed from scratch to support the development of web services, the .NET Framework simplifies the process--programmers find that tasks that took an hour using the SOAP Toolkit take just minutes.  Programming .NET Web Services is a comprehensive tutorial that teaches you the skills needed to develop web services hosted on the .NET platform. Written for experienced programmers, this book takes you beyond the obvious functionality of ASP.NET or Visual Studio .NET to give you a solid foundation in the building blocks of web services, and leads you step-by-step through the process of creating your own. Beginning with a close look at the underlying technologies of web services, including the benefits and limitations, Programming .NET Web Services discusses the unique features of the .NET Framework that make creating web services easier, including the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the namespaces used in .NET programming. Filled with numerous code examples using the C# language, the book leads you through some of the more challenging issues of web services development, including the use of proxies, marshalling of complex data types, state management, security, performance tuning and cross-platform implementation. The book also covers: Creating and publishing your first web service The UDDI project, tModels and what they mean for web service publishers Securing web service applications  Written for programmers who are familiar with the .NET Framework and interested in building industrial-strength web services, Programming .NET Web Services is full of practical information and good old-fashioned advice.

But don't just take our word for it. Read what others are saying about The Unusually Useful Web Book  ""This book definitely stands out. Most books of this nature are stuffed with irrelevant and non-substantive information that only add confusion to an already complex process. This book delivers an overwhelming amount of information but presents it in a way that is both approachable and useful. There was a lot of information that I could immediately apply to current projects."" Garo Green, Director of Publications, lynda.com  ""The coverage is practical and comprehensive. I'm not aware of other titles that take this comprehensive approach to web building, addressing the entire life cycle of web design and development as well as the roles required in each phase."" Laura McCabe, co-author of Special Edition Using Flash MX  ""Anyone that has a passion for web design, both novices and professionals, will enjoy this book. For the novice, it's an eye opener and the reader will probably be compelled to soak in all the material, cover to cover. For the professional, it's a strong reinforcement of things we often overlook and a great reference tool. I'm a professional and found it to be an up-to-date and refreshing read, and I plan on using it as a required textbook in the classroom for my students! They will truly benefit from this book and refer to it over and over again!"" Rosanna Yeung, Multimedia & Web Design Instructor, The Art Institute of California

Scholars discuss the genetic modification of embryonic cells from the viewpoints of traditional Jewish and Christian teaching, considering both the possible therapeutic benefits of this technology and moral concerns about its implementation.We are approaching the day when advances in biotechnology will allow parents to ""design"" a baby with the traits they want. The continuing debate over the possibilities of genetic engineering has been spirited, but so far largely confined to the realms of bioethics and public policy. Design and Destiny approaches the question in religious terms, discussing human germline modification (the genetic modification of the embryonic cells that become the eggs or sperm of a developing organism) from the viewpoints of traditional Christian and Jewish teaching. The contributors, leading religious scholars and writers, call our attention not to technology but to humanity, reflecting upon the meaning and destiny of human life in a technological age. Many of these scholars argue that religious teaching can support human germline modification implemented for therapeutic reasons, although they offer certain moral conditions that must be met. The essays offer a surprising variety of opinions, including a discussion of Judaism's traditional presumption in favor of medicine, an argument that Catholic doctrine could accept germline modification if it is therapeutic for the embryo, an argument implying that ""traditional"" Christian teaching permits germline modification whether for therapy or enhancement, and a ""classical"" Protestant view that germline modification should be categorically opposed.

Using an interdisciplinary approach, Design and Appraisal of Hydraulic Fractures offers a basic yet comprehensive introduction to the completion and reservoir engineering aspects of hydraulic fracture stimulation. The book covers the design and placement of a hydraulic fracture stimulation. It introduces the use of dynamic data to characterize the in-place hydraulic fracture, outlining the methods of pressure-transient analysis for both pressure-drawdown and pressure-buildup tests. Three approaches are discussed: rate-decline type curves, analytical and semianalytical methods, and numerical simulation. Essential elements are given for each and illustrated with field examples.

As a web developer, you'll already know that JavaScript is a powerful language, allowing you to add an impressive array of dynamic functionality to otherwise static web sites. But there is more power waiting to be unlocked--JavaScript is capable of full object-oriented capabilities, and by applying object-oriented principles, best practices, and design patterns to your code, you can make it more powerful, more efficient, and easier to work with alone or as part of a team.With Pro JavaScript Design Patterns, you'll start with the basics of object-oriented programming in JavaScript applicable to design patterns, including making JavaScript more expressive, inheritance, encapsulation, information hiding, and more. With that covered, you can kick-start your JavaScript development in the second part of the book, where you'll find detail on how to implement and take advantage of several design patterns in JavaScript, including composites, decorators, fa癟ades, adapters, and many more.Each chapter is packed with real-world examples of how the design patterns are best used and expert advice on writing better code, as well as what to watch out for. Along the way you'll discover how to create your own libraries and APIs for even more efficient coding.

Named one of the greatest minds of the 20th century by Time, Tim Berners-Lee is responsible for one of that century's most important advancements: the world wide web. Now, this low-profile genius-who never personally profitted from his invention -offers a compelling protrait of his invention. He reveals the Web's origins and the creation of the now ubiquitous http and www acronyms and shares his views on such critical issues as censorship, privacy, the increasing power of softeware companies, and the need to find the ideal balance between commercial and social forces. He offers insights into the true nature of the Web, showing readers how to use it to its fullest advantage. And he presents his own plan for the Web's future, calling for the active support and participation of programmers, computer manufacturers, and social organizations to manage and maintain this valuable resource so that it can remain a powerful force for social change and an outlet for individual creativity.

Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, exploded onto the scene in the spring of 2005 and remains the hottest story among web developers. With its rich combination of technologies, Ajax provides astrong foundation for creating interactive web applications with XML or JSON-based web services by using JavaScript in the browser to process the web server response.Ajax Design Patterns shows you best practices that can dramatically improve your web development projects. It investigates how others have successfully dealt with conflictingdesign principles in the past and then relays that information directly to you.The patterns outlined in the book fall into four categories: Foundational technology: Examines the raw technologies required for Ajax developmentProgramming: Exposes techniques that developers have discovered to ensure their Ajax applications are maintainableFunctionality and usability: Describes the types of user interfaces you'll come across in Ajax applications, as well as the new types of functionality that Ajax makes possibleDevelopment: Explains the process being used to monitor, debug, and test Ajax applicationsAjax Design Patterns will also get you up to speed with core Ajax technologies, such as XMLHttpRequest, the DOM, and JSON. Technical discussions are followed by code examples so you can see for yourself just what is-and isn't-possible with Ajax. This handy reference will help you to produce high-quality Ajax architectures, streamline web application performance, and improve the userexperience.Michael Mahemoff holds a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, where his thesis was ""Design Reuse in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction."" He lives in London and consults on software development issues in banking, health care, and logistics.""Michael Mahemoff's Ajax Design Patterns is a truly comprehensive compendium of webapplication design expertise, centered around but not limited to Ajax techniques. Polished nuggets of design wisdom are supported by tutorials and real-world code examples resulting in a book thatserves not only as an intermediate to expert handbook but also as an extensive reference for building rich interactive web applications.""--Brent Ashley, remote scripting pioneer

在觀念基礎篇中第一章首先從資訊系統發展的沿革，介紹網路服務的前世今生、Web Service所倚重的服務導向架構(SOA)以及Java在Web Service的解決方案，使讀者能立即對整個Web Service有個概觀的了解。第二章為XML文件的初探。Java Web Service的方案乃築基於XML之上，熟悉XML的相關規範與技術，特別是DTD與Schema，絕對是必要的！因為它們正是賦予XML可攜性(portability)的最大功臣。Java Web Service方案由各種API所組成，這些API大致上可概分為兩大類：專為處理XML文件的文件導向式(document-oriented)以及專為處理程序之用的程序導向式(procedure-oriented)。前者以JAXP與JAXB為代表，而後者則以JAX-RPC、JAXM與JAXR為主，我們以第二與第三篇分別解說該兩類API。第二篇涵蓋了三章，其中第三章介紹關於XML文件剖析的兩大模型:SAX與DOM，並深入討論有關XML命名空間(namespace)的重要議題。資料交換(data interchange)的優異能力為XML廣受產學研界青睞的原因之一，第四章即在於介紹由JAXP所支援XML文件的轉換規格XSLT以及兩種轉換引擎：Xalan與XSLTC。第五章探討另一種高效率的XML剖析模式－JAXB，其功能在於將XML Schema的內容自動產生Java類別元件，此項功能大幅提昇Java與XML的可攜性(portability)至完美境界。第三篇為XML程序導向篇，涵蓋了六章。第六章介紹XML文件的訊息服務，並探討Web Service中最重要的SOAP協定基本觀念，並以純手工的方式打造SOAP訊息與傳遞，使讀者能更貼近SOAP協定的精隨。第七章則介紹如何以WSDL描述Web Service，我們特別解說關於WSDL觀念易於混淆之處。介紹完SOAP與WSDL兩大規範後，第八章討論如何以JAX-RPC進行Web Service的呼叫，本章為Web Service的核心章節，不僅介紹了如何開發Web Service伺服端的系統，更以三種不同的方式介紹客戶端程式的開發。第九章進一步探討SOAP訊息的傳遞模式，包含了附加多媒體物件檔案與SOAP錯誤訊息的處理。第十章介紹了Web Service另一項重要機制－UDDI仲介服務，有了它，方能將好的Web Service詔告世人。本章除了探討UDDI的內部結構外，亦介紹UDDI伺服器的使用方式。承前一章，第十一章則討論如何利用JAXR來存取以及管理UDDI伺服器上的Web Service。最後一個單元則為個案實例應用篇，我們首先以一個鐵公路訂票網路服務系統，實際帶領讀者重新go through開發Web Service系統的整個流程，複習過此部份後，讀者當有醍湖灌頂之感。接著，我們簡要地介紹過去兩年來，以Web Service技術所進行的國科會SCORM數位學習計劃研究初步成果，以供讀者參考。本書附錄介紹了Java Web Service開發工具WSDP的安裝說明，以及一項重要的Java專案管理工具－Ant基本用法，其以XML的簡易語法，在開發、編譯、封裝、以及部署Web Serivce工作上，扮演極為重要的角色。【本書特色】本書希望帶給讀者的是一個有效率且紮實的學習法，以適應快速變遷的IT世界；我們盡可能以課堂上輕鬆愉快的語氣來撰寫，帶動讀者臨場學習的情緒，這種編寫的style與「Java實務程式設計」姊妹書是一致的。我們也企盼讀者在閱讀本書之餘，能從「莊子內篇養 生主第三」來體會吾人因應IT演進之道：「吾生也有涯，而知也無涯。以有涯隨無涯，殆已！已而為知者，殆而已矣！為善無近名，為惡無近刑，緣督以為經，可以保身，可以全生，可以養親，可以盡年。」

	本書是作者繼「通往ADO.NET的捷徑」之後第二本有關.NET程式設計的力作，針對Microsoft .NET在分散式應用程式設計上的相關技術，以輕鬆的筆調娓娓道出一個單機版的應用程式逐步轉化為分散式應用程式的歷程。

	作者在書中以一個網誌(Blog)系統的開發為主軸，將一個單機版的Windows應用程式，逐步轉化成為一個同時支援XML Web Services，具備Windows和Web介面，並且支援離線處理，透過Windows service和多執行緒技術在伺服器端進行批次作業的分散式應用程式。由於主角是一個網誌系統，作者也以記事的方式透過記錄一個系統的開發歷程，來帶出分散式開發技術的各個主題，能讀者一方面能夠經歷一個軟體透過不斷修正最後呈現出成熟風貌的歷程，同時也能輕鬆的瞭解到.NET的分散式應用程式設計技術。

	 

本書探討了以下在Microsoft .NET中有關分散式應用程式設計的重要技術，所有的討論都從實務的觀點出發，並且不時提及一些實際應用上的考量：

	 

	ADO.NET：如何利用ADO.NET提供分散式應用程式資料存取的功能，並且利用DataSet做為資料傳遞的媒介，在三層式架構中妥善的進行資料傳輸，開發具延展能力的系統。

	.NET Remoting：透過遠端控制的能力，讓不同電腦上的物件能夠進行通訊，同時透過物件導向的設計支援遠端事件的處理。

	XML Web Services：結合Web service容易實作的特點，將已經完成的功能透過Web service對外發行。

	MSMQ：如何利用Microsoft Messaging Queuing Service提供非同步作業的能力，並以批次的方式進行伺服器端的處理。

	Windows service：如何將伺服器端的服務實作成Windows service，透過服務管理員控制服務的啟動和依附的帳戶。

	多執行緒控制：如何設計出應用多執行緒能力的Visual Basic物件，強化系統的執行效能。

	您可以將本書視為一本.NET分散式應用程式技術的參考書籍，也可以將本書視為一本討論三層式架構設計的實戰手冊，或者當成一本軟體開發演進的心路之旅。箇中的趣味，等您來發掘。

As with any art, science, or discipline, natural talent is only part of the equation. Consistent success stems from honing your skills, cultivating good techniques, and hard work. Design engineering, a field often considered an intuitive process not amenable to scientific investigation, is no exception. Providing descriptive theory, broad context, and practical examples, Design Engineering: A Manual for Enhanced Creativity explores how to quantify creativity, codify inspiration, and document a process seemingly based solely on intuition. The authors discuss how to clarify the design task, conceptualize candidate solutions, and search for alternatives. They delineate how these phases fit into an industrial context, including engineering product development, and what to consider during design engineering to satisfy all customers. The book discusses activities and methods for performing engineering design work in a rational, reviewable, and documented way, increasing the likelihood of finding an optimal solution. The presentation covers substantiated use of intuition and opportunism as an integral part of rational, systematic, and methodical designing. It examines the influence of other topics on the work, such as psychology, computers, teamwork, application of methods, and education. The authors recommend that results from these less systematic activities be brought into the rational and systematic framework to document the results. Based on the authors' extensive industrial experience, the book elucidates a coherent body of knowledge of design engineering. The book clearly details an easily applicable theory that not only gives you solid design tools, but can also be adapted to any existing design situation.

This book presents style guidelines based on quantitative research and practitioner lore about what works on the web, what flops, and what looks like leftover newsprint. It shows how to apply those guidelines to many common Internet genres such as customer assistance, product descriptions, distance learning, marketing emails, or webzines. The book also includes case studies of the prose from popular sites-two page spreads that will show a screenshot, and analysis of the prose to see how well it works. As more companies recognize that their survival depends on putting the whole company up on the web, everyone will have to write material that appears on the website-not just specialists in IT, or Marketing, or some out-sourced agency. This is the handbook for those people.

隨著 Internet 越來越普及，所需的資訊量越來越龐大，單獨建立網頁已經很難有效地組織、規畫網站的資料，而且也無法提供即時更新的功能。

資料庫設計是透過將資料有系統且有組織地放進資料庫，再利用這些儲存在資料庫中的資料來產生網頁，這種方式不僅比個別的網頁更易於維護與搜尋特定的資料，且能輕鬆地讓相同的資料擁有不同的呈現方式。

本書討論Domino網頁程式的開發。作者試著提供進階的Domino網頁開發技術的練習範例，這與其它Domino書籍的例子不同。
    此書的目的是幫助讀者開發Domino 網頁應用程式。在書中，不會看到LotusScript的歷史（因為誰會在乎？）、來自Proust的例子或諸如 “ 為了建立視界，從功能表選「建立」的「視界」選項 ” 毫無價值的句子。相反的，作者會用一連串的範例來幫助讀者，因為以不變應萬變是最好的方法。
    簡言之，作者的目標是希望在Domino領域，讀者能和他並駕齊驅，並能創造出更好的Domino工作環境。

Beginning Database Design: From Novice to Professional provides short, easy-to-read explanations of how to get database design right the first time. This book offers numerous examples to help you avoid the many pitfalls that entrap new and not-so-new database designers. Through the help of use cases and class diagrams modeled in the UML, youll learn how to discover and represent the details and scope of the problem in question.Database design is not an exact science, and solid database design principles and examples help demonstrate the consequences of simplifications and pragmatic decisions. The rationale is to try to keep it simple, but allow room for development as situations change or resources permit. The book also features an introduction for implementing the final design in a relational database.

Personal computing has reshaped economies and industries, and is transforming how we express ourselves and relate to one another. The most personal of personal computers are the portables. We carry these gadgets with us wherever we go, whether they're laptops, smartphones, or the coolest new Web-surfing devices. The Race for Perfect tells the story of two generations of entrepreneurs, designers, and engineers as they have struggled to make ever-better portables. Steve Hamm takes the reader into a world where inspiration, design, engineering, and marketing come together to produce wave upon wave of the innovative products that we love to talk about and use. From the earliest days of portable computing, 40 years ago, entrepreneurs and designers have pushed forward relentlessly in a quest to create the perfect device. Their efforts have produced a few fabulous successes and many failures. But they never give up. They're driven by the basic rule of the tech industry: innovate or die. In addition to a fascinating read, The Race for Perfect offers valuable lessons for business people in any industry, revealing how they must INNOVATE constantly to differentiate their products CREATE design principles that are timeless INTEGRATE design and engineering so products are both useful and fun to use IMPROVE quality and convenience without compromise TAP social networks to turn customers into fans At the center of this tale is the story of a single product, Lenovo's ThinkPad X300 laptop. Lenovo, the first Chinese company to seek to establish a global consumer brand, bought IBM's PC division in 2005 primarily to get the company's storied ThinkPad laptops. The X300 was conceived as a ""halo"" product that would draw customers to Lenovo's entire line. Woven through The Race for Perfect is a case study of how this ambitious company, with teams in Japan, the United States, and China, marshaled its resources to pursue laptop perfection. As X300 came close to the finish line, it collided head-on with Apple's super-slim MacBook Air---with surprising results.

~~~~~~~大師已逝，墨跡留香~~~~~~~


	學習設計模式的人，一定聽過《Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software》這本書，俗稱GoF的《設計模式》或GoF的23個設計模式。早期就開始學習設計模式的前輩也大多讀過那本書。

	GoF的設計模式只有23個嗎？其實不只23個，在該書出版之時，有接近半打的模式未能被放入該書當中，原因有很多，例如在當年尚未取得兩個以上的大型專案實例來驗證可行性、尚未取得四人的共識、與其他模式之間的分界尚不明朗等等，都可能會導致一些模式未被納入。

	該書的遺珠之憾是那些模式呢？在本書中，作者（GoF的四位成員之一）補充了兩個模式，其中的GENERATION GAP模式已經獲得共識，只是在當年的實例不夠多，但現在看來，實在是稀鬆平常，到處都可以看到開發環境或框架採用了這個模式。

	至於另一個TYPED MESSAGE模式，在規劃初期是叫做MULTICAST模式，這個模式初期只取得其中三人的同意。藉著這個尚未取得共識的模式，作者揭露了當初在撰寫《Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software》時，四位作者之間對於模式的討論方式，讓讀者得以一窺大師們的討論、思想、以及對軟體設計的習慣。並且在說服反對者的最後關頭，還加入了另一位大師《Clean Code》作者Robert C. Martin（Bob大叔）的支援。如果您仔細閱讀本書第四章及第五章，會發現原來要成為一個新模式真是不簡單啊！那些面世的模式全都是大師們的心血結晶，無價的經驗寶藏。

	早期，有些人會批評《Design Patterns》不適合作為學習設計模式的第一本書，或許是因為有些人看的、寫的專案不夠多，所以無法體會其中的奧妙。後來，由於設計模式被大多數高級軟體工程師接受了，因此寫了非常多的相關書籍來介紹設計模式，漸漸地，設計模式不再那麼令人敬畏，也成為了軟體設計的顯學。而這類比較容易理解的書籍，通常都是採用最適合初階讀者的寫法，也就是舉出實例來說明模式。而且舉的例子越是程式設計師理解的例子，就越能使程式設計師學會設計模式並加以活用。

	有些書籍，只針對每個模式舉出一個例子，但無法找出一些好例子，可同時應用多個模式來完成同一個例子中不同的功能要求，這樣的寫作法，常常誤導了讀者，違背了設計模式的目的。換言之，一招半式是要如何走江湖呢？本書有別於那些書籍，在本書第二章中，作者以程式設計師最能理解的檔案系統為例，實際示範如何應用六個模式來解決檔案系統不同的功能需求，這六個模式之間的相互合作方式，讓人眼睛為之一亮。讚嘆道︰「原來設計模式是這樣用的啊！」

	許多讀者都在期待《設計模式》的第二版，而第二版會是什麼樣子呢？這很難說（也可能不會有第二版了），但至少可以肯定的是，本書作者對於《設計模式》第二版所能做出的貢獻，都已經寫在這本書當中了。

本書讚譽

	本書將幫你理解如何將《設計模式》──其實是任何關於設計模式的書籍──當作一本珍貴的指南，而不是一些累贅的規定。── 朗訊科技公司，貝爾實驗室 James O. Coplien

	這本技術書的文風非常吸引人，我從未讀過這麼精彩的技術書。John真的已經爐火純青、游刃有餘，他對技術主題的把握如此堅實、精準又引人入勝。── 西門子公司 Frank Buschmann

	對於套用設計模式有點經驗的程式設計師來說，遇到問題該採用這個模式還是那個模式，常常陷入難以抉擇的問題，看起來這樣也可以，那樣也可以，如果您也曾有過如此的經歷，那麼您一定要好好看完這本書，相信對您會非常助益。
	PS︰大學（甚或科大）不教設計模式，實在是令人難以理解？！── 博碩文化 總編輯 陳錦輝

資料庫實務
　近年來，隨著 Internet 的快速成長，我想有大半的功勞得歸功於 Microsoft 所發展的 Windows 作業系統，也可以說，若沒有 Windows 作業系統的問世，那今日的資訊是否能如此普及還是一個疑問，即使在眾人抱怨聲不斷及責難下成長的 Windows 作業系統，穩定性極為不佳，但在市場上的佔有率仍是第一。所以 PHP 能夠在市場上竄紅，要感謝 Linux、 FreeBSD 等作業系統。但是資訊能夠擁有今日的普及，卻得歸功於 Windows。

　Internet 近年來的成長是如此快速，要如何用簡單又快速的方式，輕鬆架構一套屬於您個人風格的 Web 網站資料庫？歡迎您打開”PHP 與 My SQL 架構 Web 資料庫實務”一書，一窺其中的奧妙！

　一個對電腦又愛又恨的人，發現：學習竟是那樣矛盾、讓人想退卻卻又欲罷不能的前進，回饋竟是那樣緩慢、但甘之如飴點滴在心頭。

Flash Application Design Solutions shows you how to harness the power of ActionScript 2.0 and make the most of the improved design tools of Flash 8 to create usable, intuitive Flash interfaces. In this book, you'll find a number of concrete Flash usability solutions that use elements such as navigation menus, data filtering, forms, content loaders, Flash liquid layouts, help tips, and many other features. You'll learn how each of these solutions actually improves on what is possible with HTML and JavaScript. In each case, you'll see how users interact with the website feature, and how it gives users the most intuitive, enjoyable experience possible while using your application. You'll get a step-by-step analysis of how to program and build each solution, and how to make it scalable, maintainable, and reusable. The book concludes with a case study that showcases the solutions developed in the previous chapters, all working together in a single application. This example puts all the pieces together and highlights just how, with some thought and consideration, Flash can improve usability on the Web. This book is essential reading for all Flash designers and developers, from beginners seeking valid solutions to veteran Flashers looking for a fresh perspective on application design, interaction, and reusability.

 Successful engineering design requires a strong understanding of fundamental concepts in the basic sciences and engineering combined with mathematics. This text provides an introduction to the design tools used in engineering design. It focuses on the first two steps of the design process: determination of need/problem clarification and conceptualization.  In addition, an overview of materials and manufacturing methods is presented. The use of Excel has been incorporated throughout the text for performing routine calculations, leaving more time for the creative aspects of the design process. Finally, the text contains an extensive discussion of systematic concept generation using the theory of inventive problem solving, TRIZ.   Below is a listing of the book's table of contents:   1.

The Web of Life,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c510862323?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=144,"Capra, Fritjof",Random House,9780385476768.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/6768/9780385476768.jpg,"

The vitality and accessibility of Fritjof Capra's ideas have made him perhaps the most eloquent spokesperson of the latest findings emerging at the frontiers of scientific, social, and philosophical thought. In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point,  he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life,  Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the ""web of life."" During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life,  Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations. Now available in paperback for the first time, The Web of Life is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's Chaos,  Gregory Bateson's Mind and Matter,  and Ilya Prigogine's Order Out of Chaos.

""Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design is a refreshing look at subject of OOAD. What sets this book apart is its focus on learning. The authors have made the content of OOAD accessible, usable for the practitioner.""Ivar Jacobson, Ivar Jacobson Consulting""I just finished reading HF OOA&D and I loved it! The thing I liked most about this book was its focus on why we do OOA&D-to write great software!""Kyle Brown, Distinguished Engineer, IBM""Hidden behind the funny pictures and crazy fonts is a serious, intelligent, extremely well-crafted presentation of OO Analysis and Design. As I read the book, I felt like I was looking over the shoulder of an expert designer who was explaining to me what issues were important at each step, and why.""Edward Sciore, Associate Professor, Computer Science Department, Boston CollegeTired of reading Object Oriented Analysis and Design books that only makes sense after you're an expert? You've heard OOA&D can help you write great software every time-software that makes your boss happy, your customers satisfied and gives you more time to do what makes you happy.But how?Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design shows you how to analyze, design, and write serious object-oriented software: software that's easy to reuse, maintain, and extend; software that doesn't hurt your head; software that lets you add new features without breaking the old ones. Inside you will learn how to: Use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexibleApply the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to promote reuse of your codeLeverage the power of design patterns to solve your problems more efficientlyUse UML, use cases, and diagrams to ensure that all stakeholders arecommunicating clearly to help you deliver the right software that meets everyone's needs.By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design compresses the time it takes to learn and retain complex information. Expect to have fun, expect to learn, expect to be writing great software consistently by the time you're finished reading this!

You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.Head First Design Patterns Poster is a companion to Head First Design Patterns. It summarizes visually, 16 of the most common design patterns including Adapter, Command, Composite Decorator, Observer, Proxy, State, Singleton, Strategy, and more. Each pattern includes a handy page reference to both Head First Design Patterns and the ""Gang of Four"" text, the canonical description of the pattern, and a visual guide designed (and inspired by the examples in Head First Design Patterns) to jog your memory of the objects, classes, and their relationships.In addition, the poster includes the ""best of"" the Head First ""Guide to Better Living with Patterns,"" including how to read a patterns catalog, the power of a shared vocabulary and annihilating evil with anti-patterns.Visually appealing and truly useful, Head First Design Patterns Poster contains what you need to know at a glance. Head First Design Patterns and this companion poster are a great combination that will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks.

In recent years the increased awareness of environmental issues has led to the development of new approaches to product design, known as Design for Environment and Life Cycle Design. Although still considered emerging and in some cases radical, their principles will become, by necessity, the wave of the future in design. A thorough exploration of the subject, Product Design for the Environment: A Life Cycle Approach presents key concepts, basic design frameworks and techniques, and practical applications. It identifies effective methods and tools for product design, stressing the environmental performance of products over their whole life cycle. After introducing the concepts of Sustainable Development, the authors discuss Industrial Ecology and Design for Environment as defined in the literature. They present the life cycle theory and approach, explore how to apply it, and define its main techniques. The book then covers the main premises of product design and development, delineating how to effectively integrate environmental aspects in modern product design. The authors pay particular attention to environmental strategies that can aid the achievement of the requisites of eco-efficiency in various phases of the product life cycle. They go on to explore how these strategies are closely related to the functional performance of the product and its components, and, therefore, to some aspects of conventional engineering design. The book also introduces phenomena of performance deterioration, together with principles of design for component durability, and methods for the assessment of residual life. Finally, the book defines entirely new methods and tools in relation to strategic issues of Life Cycle Design. Each theme provides an introduction to the problems and original proposals based on the authors' experience. The authors then discuss the implementation of these new concepts in design practice, differentiating between levels of intervention and

As wireless devices and systems get both smaller and more ubiquitous, the demand for effective but small antennas is rapidly increasing. Small Antenna Design describes the theory behind effective small antenna design and give design techniques and examples for small antennas for different operating frequencies. Design techniques are given for the entire radio spectrum, from a very hundred kilohertz to the gigahertz range. Unlike other antenna books which are heavily mathematical and theoretical, Douglas Miron keeps mathematics to the absolute minimum required to explain design techniques. Ground planes, essential for operation of many antenna designs, are extensively discussed. Author's extensive experience as a practicing antenna design engineer gives book a strong ""hands-on"" emphasisCovers antenna design techniques from very low frequency (below 300 kHz) to microwave (above 1 GHz) rangesSpecial attention is given to antenna design for mobile/portable applications such as cell phones, WiFi, etc

Addressed not only to students but also to professional engineers and scientists, this volume introduces state-space methods for direct applications to control system design, in addition to providing background for reading the periodical literature. Its presentation, therefore, is suitable both for those who require methods for achieving results and those more interested in using results than in proving them.Topics include feedback control; state-space representation of dynamic systems and dynamics of linear systems; frequency-domain analysis; controllability and observability; and shaping the dynamic response. Additional subjects encompass linear observers; compensator design by the separation principle; linear, quadratic optimum control; random processes; and Kalman filters.Concrete examples of how state-space methods can be used to advantage in several representative applications are woven into the fabric of the text and the homework problems. Many of the models are drawn from aerospace and inertial instrumentation; other examples are derived from chemical process control, maritime operations, robotics, and energy systems.

Robotics now: from transport drones and intelligent sensors to the debate around Industry 4.0Hello, Robot.: Design between Human and Machine investigates how robotics is becoming part of our everyday lives, demonstrating that design in its traditional function as a mediator is indispensable if robots are to become a visible reality and not just remain hidden in washing machines, cars and cash machines. The volume clarifies where we already encounter these intelligent machines and where we may come across them in the near future: in industry, in the military and in everyday settings; at nurseries and retirement homes; in our bodies and in the cloud; when shopping and having sex; in video games and, of course, in film and literature. In a series of in-depth essays and interviews, experts such as the science-fiction author Bruce Sterling, novelist Douglas Coupland, architect Philip Beesley, and the design duo Dunne & Raby explore the question of how we deal with our environment becoming increasingly digital, smarter and more autonomous. They highlight our often ambivalent relationship to new technologies and discuss the opportunities and challenges that are posed to us as individuals and as a society in this context.

Micro Electro Mechanical System Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c160548299?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=147,"Allen, James J.",CRC Pr I Llc,9780824758240.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8240/9780824758240.jpg,"

It is challenging at best to find a resource that provides the breadth of information necessary to develop a successful micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) design. Micro Electro Mechanical System Design is that resource. It is a comprehensive, single-source guide that explains the design process by illustrating the full range of issues involved, how they are interrelated, and how they can be quickly and accurately addressed. The materials are presented in logical order relative to the manner a MEMS designer needs to apply them. For example, in order for a project to be completed correctly, on time, and within budget, the following diverse yet correlated issues must be attended to during the initial stages of design and development: Understanding the fabrication technologies that are available  Recognizing the relevant physics involved for micron scale devices Considering implementation issues applicable to computer aided design  Focusing on the engineering details and the subsequent evaluation testing  Maintaining an eye for detail regarding both reliability and packaging These issues are fully addressed in this book, along with questions and problems at the end of each chapter that promote review and further contemplation of each topic. In addition, the appendices offer information that complement each stage of project design and development.

Verification of Branch and Bound Algorithms Applied to Water Distribution Network Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c004936026?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=149,"Hailer,Angelika",Logos Verlag Berlin,9783832513160.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3160/9783832513160.jpg,"

The design of distribution networks is an integral factor in the planning process of water supply systems. Models concerning this design process contain the problem of selecting pipe diameters for a given layout of the network. Assuming the demand to be estimated for a certain point of time and the costs for pipes of different diameters to be known, this stationary problem can be formulated as a nonlinear global optimization problem. Restrictions to the pressure head and the calculations of head-loss due to friction in the pipes imply nonlinear constraints. Heuristic as well as deterministic algorithms have been developed during the last 30 years to solve this problem. Their implementation is based on floating point arithmetic. In a branch and bound algorithm the decision for every branch depends on numerical results. Therefore even small errors may have farreaching consequences. In the context of this thesis the software package WaTerInt has been developed which contains the first verified algorithm for water distribution design optimization to avoid this problem. WaTerInt is based on the branch and bound algorithm developed by Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan and results from interval analysis, allowing rigorous bounds together with a guarantee of existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, a new additional constraint propagation technique is introduced which decreases the computational time for expansion networks by approximately one third to one half. The computational results using non-verified floating point calculations are found to show numerical artifacts. For example, it is possible that a problem is identified as infeasible that in reality does have a solution, or that the lower bound for the optimal solution is larger than the upper bound. Using verified calculations, these artifacts are avoided, the obtained results are always reliable. Nevertheless for this improved quality, in the current implementation the computational time for verified calculations takes on average fifteen times the time needed for the calculation without error analysis when relying just on pure floating point arithmetic. This factor could probably be decreased when not depending on interpretation overhead of MATLAB, especially for object orientation. In addition to the model based on Hazen-Williams formula as used by Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan, the optimization problem is reformulated to contain Darcy-Weisbach and Colebrook-White equations. The algorithm has been expanded to be able to solve this more accurate problem as well, and again a verified version is presented. Essentially, detailed investigation of the nonlinearity of the implicitly defined Colebrook-White equation was necessary to retain certain monotonicity and convexity arguments. The adjacency property is proved for this new problem as well. However, the computational effort is around forty times higher than for the Hazen-Williams problem. To combine the advantages of the Darcy-Weisbach optimization problem with the more simple structure and lower computational times of Hazen-Williams, the coefficients of this formula are adjusted to obtain a closer approximation. Finally, verified results have been used to compare results obtained for different head loss formulae and hydraulic parameters for known test networks. When regarding the whole life span of a pipe network it occurs that energy costs form a significant part of the overall costs, except when water is mainly delivered by gravity. In summary, recently developed verification techniques are combined with a branch and bound algorithm to investigate the practicability of obtaining error estimates along with the calculation of the optimal solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. They are applied to water network distribution design, both to the known branch and bound algorithm of Sherali, Subramanian and Loganathan and to the one for the more realistic network model based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation.

A Theory of Fun for Game Design is not your typical how-to book. It features a novel way of teaching interactive designers how to create and improve their designs to incorporate the highest degree of fun. As the book shows, designing for fun is all about making interactive products like games highly entertaining, engaging, and addictive. The book's unique approach of providing a highly visual storyboard approach combined with a narrative on the art and practice of designing for fun is sure to be a hit with game and interactive designers, At first glance A Theory of Fun for Game Design is a book that will truly inspire and challenge game designers to think in new was; however, its universal message will influence designers from all walks of life. This book captures the real essence of what drives us to seek out products and experiences that are truly fun and entertaining. The author masterfully presents his engaging theory by showing readers how many designs are lacking because they are predictable and not engaging enough. He then explains how great designers use different types of elements in new ways to make designs more fun and compelling. Anyone who is interested in design will enjoy how the book works on two levels--as a quick inspiration guide to game design, or as an informative discussion that details the insightful thinking from a great mind in the game industry.

 A comprehensive training resource for producing electric power from the sun.  Producing electricity from the sun using photovoltaic (PV) systems has become a major industry worldwide. But designing, installing and maintaining such systems requires knowledge and training, and there have been few easily accessible, comprehensive guides to the subject.  Now, with  Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual , a world-class solar energy training and education provider--Solar Energy International (SEI)--has made available the critical information to successfully design, install and maintain PV systems.

This text's contemporary approach focuses on the concepts of linear control systems, rather than computational mechanics. Straightforward coverage includes an integrated treatment of both classical and modern control system methods. The text emphasizes design with discussions of problem formulation, design criteria, physical constraints, several design methods, and implementation of compensators. Discussions of topics not found in other texts--such as pole placement, model matching and robust tracking--add to the text's cutting-edge presentation. Students will appreciate the applications and discussions of practical aspects, including the leading problem in developing block diagrams, noise, disturbances, and plant perturbations. State feedback and state estimators are designed using state variable equations and transfer functions, offering a comparison of the two approaches. The incorporation of MATLAB throughout the text helps students to avoid time-consuming computation and concentrate on control system design and analysis.

想知道你家貓咪，都在做什麼嗎？

２２位主人、５８隻喵星人＝根本就是貓控天堂！

超級萌FUN的貓咪日常生活！！！

	 

	***********

	 

	你可曾經仔細觀察過喵星人的一天嗎？

	貓奴們，不要不承認，其實你早就想裝隱藏攝影機了！

	22位貓奴與58隻可愛喵星人的生活故事，大大滿足你的變態欲望！

	 

	在你睡覺時，貓就是愛占床；

	在你工作時，貓總是亂入霸占電腦

	貓奴們開心買了玩具，喵星人卻一動也不動……

	 

	每隻貓咪，都有著獨一無二的個性！

	有非常親人的貓，也有膽小如鼠的貓，也有傲嬌或是自我風格非常強烈的貓……

	 

	但也正因為喵星人如此特別，

	貓奴們才會被萌萌貓們電得頭暈腦脹。

	 

	本書收錄58隻素人貓咪的可愛日常生活，透過有趣照片、溫馨小故事、地盤與活動路徑示意圖、創意手作玩具，介紹喵星人的日常生活與遊樂型態。

	 

	從好傻好天真的萌逼照片，到貓奴們愛到深處無怨尤的甘苦談（傻笑），以及讓人不禁噗哧一笑的四格漫畫、貓大人語錄……讓你更加了解愛貓的個性、照護管理問題等等，給予愛貓更完善的健康環境！還有許多在海外生活的貓咪們，各位貓奴，千萬不要錯過！

本書精彩內容：

主人不在家，喵星人開PARTY囉！

原來，在你看不見的地方，貓咪都這樣玩HIGH！

	 

▼【喵星人，一天２４小時，都在幹嘛？】

	對，這個問題我也很好奇……除了睡覺和發呆，貓咪都在幹嘛？

	 

▼【完整公開！喵星人的私人地盤與活動路徑】

	當主人離家上班或上學之後，貓咪在家的生活內容到底是如何呢？只要仔細記錄下來，就會發現貓咪獨自在家可不是都在懶懶的睡覺，相反的其實還非常活躍，簡直是一刻都閒不下來呢！

	 

▼【自己動手做！創意貓玩具】

	你是否常常碰到花了好幾百塊買回來的貓玩具，卻無法吸引貓咪的注意呢？又或者玩具買回來沒三兩下就給愛貓解體了？其實，貓玩具完全自己可以DIY！！

	 

	※手作玩具：瓦楞紙箱、衛生紙捲筒芯、報紙、麻繩、舊襪子回收再利用。

	 

	本書介紹的貓咪玩具有些使用繩子或木頭珠珠，請謹慎使用，避免家中誤食。貓咪玩玩具時，飼主請務必在旁陪伴，使用完畢後，請收在貓咪拿不到的地方。

	 

	 

▼【貓奴們的血淚控訴】

	l   一本讓人看到入迷的貓咪書，從貓咪的角度來看人類，真的非常有趣！──pingu

	 

	 

	 

	l   原本以為這只是一本很普通的貓咪寫真書，內容卻是超級豐富，一次大大滿足所有貓奴！讓我手癢也想來ＤＩＹ貓玩具了（笑）──仮面らいだぁ

Automated speech recognition (ASR) applications - you speak naturally, and a computer system both understands what you say and answers intelligently, as opposed to touch-tone phone systems - are poised to grow at a phenomenal pace, from about a $120 million business today to more than $2 billion in 2006. We all increaslingly experience such applications when we telephone airlines, banks, and other consumer companies for information. Key to the success of all these applications is the design and development of effective voice user interfaces (VUIs.) This book shows how to design, deploy, and assess VUIs. The author team from Nuance, one of the two market leaders, includes a computer scientist, a psychologist, and a linguist, reflecting the broad range of expertise required for such work. The book itself combines discussion of essential VUI design principles and practical methodology with real-world examples of good design. It should become the standard reference to VUI design.

Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes. It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns. A software design pattern can be identified as ""a recurring solution to a recurring problem."" Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another? But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started. Crawford and Kaplan's J2EE Design Patterns approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software. They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability.  J2EE Design Patterns offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face: Maintenance (Extensibility) Performance (System Scalability) Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling) Transactions (process Modeling) Messaging (Interoperability) And with its careful balance between theory and practice, J2EE Design Patterns will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience.

Since the announcement of Visual Basic .NET, a lot has been made of its powerful object-oriented features. However, very little discussion has been devoted to the practice of object-oriented programming at its most fundamental level--that is, building classes. The truth is, whatever code you write in Visual Basic .NET, you are writing classes that fall within the class hierarchy of the .NET Framework. Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook was conceived as a guide to help you design these classes effectively, by looking at what control you have over your classes and how Visual Basic .NET turns your class definitions into executable code. This book will give you a deep and thorough understanding of the implications of all the decisions you can make in designing a class, so you are equipped to develop classes that are robust, flexible, and reusable. In short, this book will take you from a theoretical understanding of the basic principles of object-oriented programming to the ability to write well-designed classes in actual applications.

Antenna Theory & Design,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c709155023?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=152,"Elliott, Robert Stratman",Ingram      ,9780471449966.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/9966/9780471449966.jpg,"

First published in 1981, Robert S. Elliott's Antenna Theory and Design is one of the most significant works in electromagnetic theory and applications. In its broad-ranging, analytic treatment, replete with supporting experimental evidence, Antenna Theory and Design conveys fundamental methods of analysis that can be used to predict the electromagnetic behavior of nearly everything that radiates. After more than two decades, it remains a key resource for students, professors, researchers, and engineers who require a comprehensive, in-depth treatment of the subject. In response to requests from many of our members, IEEE is now reissuing this classic. Newly revised, it once again will be an invaluable textbook and an enduring reference for practicing engineers. The IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory offers outstanding coverage of the field. It consists of new titles of contemporary interest as well as reissues and revisions of recognized classics by established authors and researchers. The series emphasizes works of long-term archival significance in electromagnetic waves and applications. Designed specifically for graduate students, researchers, and practicing engineers, the series provides affordable volumes that explore and explain electromagnetic waves beyond the undergraduate level.

With a trailblazing career that spans more than seventy-five years and continues to this day, with recent creations that include a Martini glass featured in Bombay Sapphire ads and vases for Klein-Reid, Eva Zeisel stands at the forefront of modern designers. Her works are a reflection of a profoundly independent vision and are featured in the permanent collections of museums throughout the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.  In this lavishly illustrated, full-color book, the designer for the first time communicates the ideas that have guided and inspired her. Each aspect of the design process is analyzed?variety, spontaneity, line, contour, shading, and texture, among others?to show how the best works are the result of a dialogue between creator and object, the result of which is an environment that is pleasurable, comfortable, and elegant. The language in which this dialogue is conducted, ?the language of things, ? is one in which Zeisel's fluency is unparalleled, and her thoughts, read alongside the photos of her stunning creations and those that have inspired her, make this book indispensable to every enthusiast of art, ceramics, and design.

	This book covers only the very fundamentalaspects of Logic Design.In order to give a logical presentationof the subject, the organization of thisbook is different from most of the existingtextbooks. A detailed introduction to SwitchingAlgebra is included to help students build asolid mathematical background. Also, discussionson asynchronous sequential circuits are presentedbefore those on synchronous sequential circuits.This book is written for a one-semester entry-levelcourse. Topics in 2.13 (The Petrick’s Methodand the Tabulation Method) and 4.6 (Design ofAsynchronous Sequential Circuits) are optional.The materials covered are explained in full detail.Therefore, students can always come back and use thebook as a self-study guide.

Professional Design Patterns in VB .NET: Building Adaptable Applications is not merely design pattern theory. No, no. Instead, the authors show design patterns applied to real-world architectural scenarios, so you can witness the patterns in action, reaping benefits along the way! The core of this book contains three case studies, which explain design pattern application in each main tier of an application: data, business, and presentation layers. These case studies flesh out your understanding of design patterns, illustrating how the scenarios can be realistically employed and recognized by all Visual Basic .NET programmers. Also featured: how design patterns can be used in conjunction with .NET Remoting, to be applied across tiers, as well as within them. And since many VB .NET programmers may not be wholly familiar with UML, the authors also provide a UML primer as an appendix.

Books on information theory and coding have proliferated over the last few years, but few succeed in covering the fundamentals without losing students in mathematical abstraction. Even fewer build the essential theoretical framework when presenting algorithms and implementation details of modern coding systems. Without abandoning the theoretical foundations, Fundamentals of Information Theory and Coding Design presents working algorithms and implementations that can be used to design and create real systems. The emphasis is on the underlying concepts governing information theory and the mathematical basis for modern coding systems, but the authors also provide the practical details of important codes like Reed-Solomon, BCH, and Turbo codes. Also setting this text apart are discussions on the cascading of information channels and the additivity of information, the details of arithmetic coding, and the connection between coding of extensions and Markov modelling. Complete, balanced coverage, an outstanding format, and a wealth of examples and exercises make this an outstanding text for upper-level students in computer science, mathematics, and engineering and a valuable reference for telecommunications engineers and coding theory researchers.

以Visual Basic設計物件導向系統並不是件容易的事，但最後總是能輕而易舉的解決所遇到的難題。如果有正確的系統設計，則物件導向系統是相當具有擴充性的，而且容易達成，也可重複使用，設計範本(Design Patterns)就是用來幫助專業的物件導向程式設計師達成此目標。所以本書的主要目的是要幫助您在Visual Basic中有效使用設計範本來設計和撰寫品質更好的物件導向系統。
此外，在本書中所提到的設計範本並不是新的解決方案，而是一些常用的和已被專業物件導向設計師所實際執行証明過的解決辦法。所以本書的目的之一是，使這些解決方案讓使用Visual Basic的物件導向程式設計師能很容易地了解。
本書共分為三大部分。第一部分是物件基本概念，在這個部分中，概略說明了Visual Basic如何及為什麼是屬於物件導向的程式設計，其目的是要讓您了解和熟悉設計範本的功能；第二部分是設計範本步驟，這個部分是由許多章所組成，每一章都會說明一個特定的設計範本，以便讓您針對不同的應用領域，選擇適當的設計範本；第三部分是附錄，所包含的主題是您要有效使用本書所必須熟讀的，附錄A說明了本書中所使用的物件圖形表示法；附錄B則簡短地討論一些介面和類別在執行時所引發的問題。

Henry Petroski's previous bestsellers have delighted readers with intriguing stories about the engineering marvels around us, from the lowly pencil to the soaring suspension bridge. In this book, Petroski delves deeper into the mystery of invention, to explore what everyday artifacts and sophisticated networks can reveal about the way engineers solve problems.Engineering entails more than knowing the way things work. What do economics and ecology, aesthetics and ethics, have to do with the shape of a paper clip, the tab of a beverage can, the cabin design of a turbojet, or the course of a river? How do the idiosyncrasies of individual engineers, companies, and communities leave their mark on projects from Velcro(R) to fax machines to waterworks?Invention by Design offers an insider's look at these political and cultural dimensions of design and development, production and construction.Readers unfamiliar with engineering will find Petroski's enthusiasm contagious, whether the topic is the genesis of the Ziploc baggie or the averted collapse of Manhattan's sleekest skyscraper. And those who inhabit the world of engineering will discover insights to challenge their customary perspective, whether their work involves failure analysis, systems design, or public relations. Written with the flair that readers have come to expect from his books, Invention by Design reaffirms Petroski as the master explicator of the principles and processes that turn thoughts into the many things that define our made world.

Design patterns have become a staple of object-oriented design and programming by providing elegant, easy-to-reuse, and maintainable solutions to commonly encountered programming challenges. However, many busy Java programmers have yet to learn about design patterns and incorporate this powerful technology into their work. Java Design Patterns is exactly the tutorial resource you need. Gentle and clearly written, it helps you understand the nature and purpose of design patterns. It also serves as a practical guide to using design patterns to create sophisticated, robust Java programs. This book presents the 23 patterns cataloged in the flagship book Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides. In Java Design Patterns, each of these patterns is illustrated by at least one complete visual Java program. This practical approach makes design pattern concepts more concrete and easier to grasp, brings Java programmers up to speed quickly, and enables you to take practical advantage of the power of design patterns. Key features include: *Introductory overviews of design patterns, the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) *Screen shots of each of

●人們認為大部分的設計都是外表包裝，但是這和設計真正的意義相差甚遠，設計是位於人所製造出的創造物中心之靈魂。－史帝夫．賈柏斯見識過Photoshop的強大力量之後，你會開始認知到，它能做到的地步是多麼無窮，而令人讚嘆的地步。讓你的想像盡情奔馳吧！Photoshop將能實現你所有願望。此書是以我們日常生活中自然而然會接觸的生活、感覺、味道為主題，記錄完成藝術作品之過程的Photoshop工具書。在決定各個例題的主題之後，接著在設計者天馬行空的想法中掌握住設計的概念，先從煩惱該如何表現其概念開始著手，試著透過步驟表現出設計者所想像的感覺，藉此學習各式各樣的方法並活用之。除了忠實紀錄每個技巧的視窗步驟，書中也收錄許多設計師及名人說給創意工作者的忠告，對於讀者來說，本書不僅能夠精進實作技巧，更能如醍醐灌頂般啟發創作時的心靈，這是難能可貴之處，也是有別於傳統Photoshop教學書的特色。★此書獻給經常使用Photoshop製作海報、DM的設計創作者，你們需要更源源不絕的靈感來源，以及雕琢技術再啟發。

本書的前三章簡介網頁應用程式本身，並且比較Oracle一些工具程式的優缺點以及簡介它們如何運作。 
接著第四章是一些步驟，讓您能夠安裝「所有的」Oracle軟體在一台機器上，也就是資料庫，應用程式伺服器以及發展環境。在理想的情況下，您將會需要一部性能中上的個人電腦來安裝這些軟體。電腦上應該要有Windows NT或Windows 2000作業系統，至少256MB的記憶體（128MB也成，但是要大一點的硬碟置換空間）。整個安裝過程的指令是假設安裝在Windows 2000之上，但是絕大多數的指令在Linux和其他Unix環境下也都一樣。 
第五章則介紹一些應用程式發展的方法論，無論您選擇用Java、PL/SQL或其他語言都可以派上用場。 
第六章描述用Java servlet和Oracle JDeveloper發展四個小型網頁程式；第七章則改用PL/SQL語言完成這些工作。為了讓您在各個章節中相互對照，這兩章採用同樣的資料，這也說明了儘管程式語言不同，寫程式的方法都是大同小異。 
第八章和第九章講的是如何用Oracle程式碼產生工具，也就是Oracle Designer和Oracle Portal。在這兩章裏，同樣的四個小應用程式也拿來當作例子。 
第十章則提到Oracle主從式架構發展工具Forms和Reports，它們同樣可以來發展網頁應用程式。 
第十一章列出一些當您在發展Oracle網頁應用程式時會用到的一些工具和小幫手。
第十二章則解釋範例程式中用到的核心程式庫（本書所有範例程式都可以從www.vesterli.com下載）。最後一章提供您一些書籍和網站的建議清單，讓您可以繼續深入研究到達Oracle網頁應用程式大師的境界。

當人們凝視無垠的穹蒼時，總會湧現種種問題：如何才能了解自己所存在的這個世界？宇宙如何運作？真實的本質是什麼？萬物從何而來？宇宙需要造物主嗎？欲了解宇宙最深處的奧祕，不僅需要知道宇宙如何運作，更要探究為什麼：為什麼世上有東西而非空無一物？我們為什麼存在？為什麼宰制宇宙的是M理論這套特定的法則而非其他法則？這是對生命、宇宙和天地萬物的終極大問，本書將試圖提供這些問題的答案。宇宙何時起源又是如何起源的呢？為什麼人類生在這裡？為什麼世界上並非空無一物？真實的本質到底為何？為什麼自然法則如此恰到好處，讓人類這等生物得以存在？最後一個問題是，這種看似天衣無縫的「大設計」，究竟證明宇宙是蒙主眷顧而創造一切，抑或科學能提供另一種解釋呢？有關宇宙與生命起源的根本問題，向來歸屬於哲學範疇，如今卻已成為科學家、哲學家與神學家百家爭鳴之領域。在這本最新力作之中，霍金與曼羅迪諾對於宇宙最深奧的祕密，提出科學上最新的想法。他們用的不是深奧難懂的專業術語，而是以簡單明瞭的方式娓娓道來。根據量子理論，兩位作者在《大設計》中指出，宇宙並非只有單一的存在或單一歷史，而是每個可能的歷史都同時存在。將這種想法運用在宇宙整體上，對於傳統的因果觀念就產生了懷疑。而霍金和曼羅迪諾依「由上而下」的宇宙學研究法指出，從過去沒有確切的形式這點看來，說明了人們經由觀察創造歷史，而並非歷史創造我們的觀點。他們進一步解釋，我們本身是宇宙初生之際量子起伏的產物，並且提出量子理論如何預測了「眾宇宙」的存在，亦即這個宇宙只是眾多的宇宙之一；所有的宇宙都是從無中自然生出，各自擁有不同的自然法則。在本書中，霍金與曼羅迪諾挑戰了傳統對真實的概念，也只有「與模型相關」的理論能夠找到最真的真實。最後，他們對於M理論進行徹底與生動的分析；M理論是解釋支配人類與宇宙法則的理論，也是目前唯一有望成為完整的「萬物理論」之理論。這本書筆力簡潔且內容豐富，提出科學上有力的發現與證據，勢將改變人類對宇宙的認知，甚至動搖到不可動搖的信仰體制。《大設計》為我們帶來的衝擊與啟發，將會是前所未有的。

How did a simple design error cause one of the great disasters of the 1980s - the collapse of the walkways at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel? What made the graceful and innovative Tacoma Narrows Bridge twist apart in a mild wind in 1940? How did an oversized waterlily inspire the magnificent Crystal Palace, the crowning achievement of Victorian architecture and engineering? These are some of the failures and successes that Henry Petroski, author of the acclaimed The Pencil, examines in this engaging, wonderfully literate book. More than a series of fascinating case studies, To Engineer is Human is a work that looks at our deepest notions of progress and perfection, tracing the fine connection between the quantifiable realm of science and the chaotic realities of everyday life.

	沒落的煤礦聚落「猴硐」，原是途經九份的「偶然」，現在因為貓村、歷史遺跡、自然景觀成為遊客的「必然」。

	曾經在歷史舞台締造出一系列的繁榮盛景、歷史彌堅的迷人故事，因煤礦業沒落後加上年輕人口外移而逐漸沒落，近年卻因貓村的興起吸引國內外觀光人潮，產生新的聚落效應，猴硐車站更躍升新興景點，讓這個好山好水的山城再度熱鬧非凡。

	為展現猴硐地方人文與精神，本書結合曾榮獲日本田代島貓咪攝影比賽第一名的貓夫人攝影作品，以及國內知名插畫家貓小P手繪作品，以創新的概念顛覆一般人對傳統筆記本的印象，讓本書不再只是具備一般傳統記事、寫字功能，同時具備猴硐在地文化的圖文故事書！

	想知道猴硐貓咪的可愛之處嗎？想了解這個小山城因貓而改變的故事嗎？本書不僅收錄了可愛得讓人尖叫的貓咪照片，以及地方人士第一手陳述猴硐改變的感人過程，無論你是否拜訪過猴硐，都是一本值得細細閱讀、值得收藏的創意文化筆記本。

Introducing Quantum Theory,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/2033930140841?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Web%20API%20Design&pi=161,Mcenvoy- J. P.,Icon Books  ,9781840468502.0,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/8502/9781840468502.jpg,"

Quantum theory is one of science's most thrilling, challenging and even mysterious areas. Scientists such as Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and Schr繹dinger uncovered bizarre paradoxes in the early 20th century that seemed to destroy the fundamental assumptions of 'classical physics' - the basic laws we are taught in school. Notoriously difficult, quantum theory is nonetheless an amazing and inspiring intellectual adventure, explained here with patience, wit and clarity.

知名科學家史蒂芬．霍金所著的《大設計》為「新無神論」陣營注入一強心針，成為論戰中的最新利器，這本書聲稱宇宙乃是由物理定律而不是神所創造出來的。牛津大學的數學家也是《上帝的送葬者》（God’s Undertaker）一書的作者約翰．倫諾克斯，對此迅速而坦率的回應，仔細檢視霍金的推論邏輯。倫諾克斯以生動而淺顯的文字，帶領我們檢視霍金的主要論點，並以最新的科學和哲學方法和理論的明確解釋顯示出霍金非但未能推翻造物主的存在，實際上還讓神的存在變得更有說服力。 本書特色「對史蒂芬．霍金的《大設計》之精采回應，請務必同時看看這兩方的論點。」－－《道金斯的幻覺》作者阿立斯特．麥格拉思（Alister McGrath）「將神放逐當然是相當狂妄的主張。……有這麼多的疑點，我們當然要霍金拿出證據來證明他的說法。他的論點是否真的禁得起嚴格的審視？我想我們有權力知道。」
