New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost.While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world.This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for. Naturally, the language was received well by the programming community. Today, it is one of the most important languages for both professionals and students who aim to excel in fields like Machine Learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and so much more.With real-life examples showing a wide variety of use, Python is now living and breathing in almost every major social platform, web application, and website.

Writing and running software is now as much a part of science as telescopes and test tubes, but most researchers are never taught how to do either well. As a result, it takes them longer to accomplish simple tasks than it should, and it is harder for them to share their work with others than it needs to be.  This book introduces the concepts, tools, and skills that researchers need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Based on the practical experiences of its authors, who collectively have spent several decades teaching software skills to scientists, it covers everything graduate-level researchers need to automate their workflows, collaborate with colleagues, ensure that their results are trustworthy, and publish what they have built so that others can build on it. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of Python as a starting point, and shows readers how it, the Unix shell, Git, Make, and related tools can give them more time to focus on the research they actually want to do.  Research Software Engineering with Python can be used as the main text in a one-semester course or for self-guided study. A running example shows how to organize a small research project step by step; over a hundred exercises give readers a chance to practice these skills themselves, while a glossary defining over two hundred terms will help readers find their way through the terminology. All of the material can be re-used under a Creative Commons license, and all royalties from sales of the book will be donated to The Carpentries, an organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

Developers power their projects with Python because it emphasizes readability, ease of use, and access to a meticulously maintained set of packages and tools. The language itself continues to improve with every release: writing in Python is full of possibility. But to maintain a successful Python project, you need to know more than just the language. You need tooling and instincts to help you make the most out of what's available to you. Use this book as your guide to help you hone your skills and sculpt a Python project that can stand the test of time. No matter your experience level or background, Python's batteries-included standard library and rich third-party ecosystem provide a solid foundation to build your projects on. With the right intuition and background knowledge, you can take advantage of all the power Python offers. Take a guided tour of some of Python's high points to craft a project that you can sustain and build on for a long time. Run static analysis tools to detect and eliminate classes of bugs before you run code. Experiment with Python's concurrency model and develop patterns for using Python's thread and process abstractions to their full potential. Introduce yourself to Python's type hinting system: mypy. Download and run third-party Python packages and do so safely without compromising on security. Debug code using Python's built in debugger, and try procedures out in the interactive console. Run your code under new versions of the Python interpreter to unlock performance and usability improvements. All along the way, sharpen your Python instincts so you can keep your code clean and reduce the chance of bugs. Mine Python for all you can by playing to its strengths and embracing patterns that harness its potential. What You Need:  The books assumes you have some experience programming in any language (not necessarily Python).

These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning. Steven and Dusty provide a friendly, comprehensive tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. UML class diagrams are generously used throughout the text for you to understand class relationships. Beyond the book's focus on OOP, it features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced in this book. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem. By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs.What You Will Learn: Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methodsExtend class functionality using inheritanceUse exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanlyUnderstand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use themDiscover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in PythonUncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so importantLearn to statically type check your dynamic codeUnderstand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programsWho this book is for: If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you.

Learn to create responsive front-end web applications in Python using the React and Material-UI JavaScript libraries without having to program in JavaScript! How is this possible? By using the Transcrypt transpiler that turns your Python code into JavaScript.Let's face it, JavaScript is the way of the web, and Python doesn't run in a web browser. BUT, just like the popular TypeScript language that gets compiled into JavaScript to run in a web browser, Transcrypt does the same thing for Python. Because of the way Transcrypt maps Python data types and language constructs to JavaScript, your Python code is able to directly utilize the full ecosystem of JavaScript libraries that exist, taking advantage of existing web application technologies rather than trying to replace them.Using a Python-centric viewpoint, this book outlines the developer tools and software libraries needed to develop front-end web applications with Python, specifically focusing on the popular React library and open-source Material-UI library that includes a collection of React components based on Google's Material Design user interface specification. In addition to chapters covering how to implement specific application features, in a learn-by-doing fashion, the last section of the book walks you through building a fully functional example application from start to finish, giving you an idea of how everything fits together.While this book isn't necessarily meant for beginning programmers, if you are already familiar with Python and want to create front-end web applications but don't want to have to delve into the complexities of a full JavaScript ecosystem, don't want to have to keep switching back and forth between languages for the same full-stack application, or if you just don't care to program in JavaScript in general, the approach taken in this book gives you another option using Python.

This book provides a full presentation of the current concepts and available techniques to make ""machine learning"" systems more explainable. The approaches presented can be applied to almost all the current ""machine learning"" models: linear and logistic regression, deep learning neural networks, natural language processing and image recognition, among the others.Progress in Machine Learning is increasing the use of artificial agents to perform critical tasks previously handled by humans (healthcare, legal and finance, among others). While the principles that guide the design of these agents are understood, most of the current deep-learning models are ""opaque"" to human understanding. Explainable AI with Python fills the current gap in literature on this emerging topic by taking both a theoretical and a practical perspective, making the reader quickly capable of working with tools and code for Explainable AI.Beginning with examples of what Explainable AI (XAI) is and why it is needed in the field, the book details different approaches to XAI depending on specific context and need. Hands-on work on interpretable models with specific examples leveraging Python are then presented, showing how intrinsic interpretable models can be interpreted and how to produce ""human understandable"" explanations. Model-agnostic methods for XAI are shown to produce explanations without relying on ML models internals that are ""opaque."" Using examples from Computer Vision, the authors then look at explainable models for Deep Learning and prospective methods for the future. Taking a practical perspective, the authors demonstrate how to effectively use ML and XAI in science. The final chapter explains Adversarial Machine Learning and how to do XAI with adversarial examples.

 Description This book Computer Programming Python Machine learning Swift Golang 2021 2022Is a wonderful assortment of the absolute best languages to know for the future.It is the most optimum choice of programming languages to choose for a single book. It includes the main essential languages like Python and JavaScript, that every programmer should walk into an interview knowing. But it also includes some little know new languages that you may not have heard of, that are so easy to learn and versatile and cross plat formed that they are set to explode in popularity in the near future. More about this later. If you read this book and learn these languages then your future will be lived on your own terms. Consider going into a job interview respectfully but with zero worry. Where the potential employer is the one that's being interviewed. And he seems a little desperate and a little too accommodating, that you know this is going to be another one of those interviews where he either stands up after 20 minutes offers to shake your hand and offers you the job right there on the spot.Or the interview turns into an HR interview where your assumed to be hired based on your application and you are just going through the paperwork and company benefits and policies.Either way based on what you want to do you can take the job or not take that job, because you have a choice.Opposed to the alternative of being told that you will get a call in a few weeks or don't call us we'll call you. About these languages .Python: some of the companies that use Python are, Google, Facebook, Instagram, NASA uses python, Mozilla, Firefox, Drop box, IBM, Redit, and QuaraPython is becoming one of the worlds most popular programming languages. Java Script users include Paypal, Netflix, Uber, Group on, Facebook, Google, E-bay, Airbnb, Stack, Slack and, Instagram. Machine Learning (AI) What is it? And what is it used for? It can be used along with python, since it is used in Google search, and auto complete. It helps predict what you will search for next. Machine Learning (AI) Is used in many different fields and applications including, self driving/parking cars, facial recognition, medical x-ray image interpretation, drones and many many other applications.. Swift is also a great language to learn, because everything has to move with fund transfers. APP creation Android, and IOS is used by swift. This is also a cross plat form language.  GO Golang, ( go language) Last but defiantly not least GO is my second favorite language next to Python or JavaScript. This new programming language is not very well Know but it is designed to be super easy to learn and has many of the best features from many top languages. It is also a very user friendly cross platform language, among the many new streamlined features it has a built in garbage collector.

In this book you will unpack how these powerful models are created from relatively simple building blocks, and how you might adapt these models to your own use cases.You will begin by setting up clean containerized environments for Python and getting to grips with the fundamentals of deep neural networks, learning about core concepts like the perceptron, activation functions, backpropagation, and how they all tie together. Once you have covered the basics, you will explore deep generative models in depth, including OpenAI's GPT-series of news generators, networks for style transfer and deepfakes, and synergy with reinforcement learning.As you progress, you will focus on abstractions where useful, and understand the ""nuts and bolts"" of how the models are composed in code, underpinned by detailed architecture diagrams. The book concludes with a variety of practical projects to generate music, images, text, and speech using the methods you have learned in prior sections, piecing together TensorFlow layers, utility functions, and training loops to uncover links between the different modes of generation.By the end of this book, you will have acquired the knowledge to create and implement your own generative AI models.What You Will Learn: Implement paired and unpaired style transfer with networks like StyleGANUse facial landmarks, autoencoders, and pix2pix GAN to create deepfakesBuild several text generation pipelines based on LSTMs, BERT, and GPT-2, learning how attention and transformers changed the NLP landscapeCompose music using LSTM models, simple generative adversarial networks, and the intricate MuseGANTrain a deep learning agent to move through a simulated physical environmentDiscover emerging applications of generative AI, such as folding proteins and creating videos from imagesWho this book is for: This book will appeal to Python programmers, seasoned modelers, and machine learning engineers who are keen to learn about the creation and implementation of generative models. To make the most out of this book, you should have a basic familiarity with probability theory, linear algebra, and deep learning.

Win the Trust of Your Clients with this Professional Book  Why Python has been proclaimed by the most Professional Techs as the best Scripting Language ?  Do you want to learn Coding from scratch? Python is presumably the easiest-to-learn and nicest-to-use programming language in widespread use. Python code is clear to read and write, and it is short without being cryptic.It is a very powerful language, which means that we can generally write far fewer lines of Python code than would be needed for an equivalent application written in, say, C++ or Java. Python is typically typed in an implicit and dynamic format; hence, there is no requirement to declare variables. These types are enforced, and the variables are sensitive to cases. There is no definite array of characters used to terminate statements in Python. Any statement which expects a level of indentation is concluded using a colon sign. Multiple variables can also be used on a single line. This book covers the following topics:  - The 7 main Features of Python- Why you should use Python- What is the best Python web app framework and why- Data Types in Python- Conditional Statements- Why is Python so popular in Machine Learning- ...&Lot more! In Python Programming, the English language is mainly used in coding many keywords. The mastery of these keywords means knowledge of the fundamental aspects of python programming. However, before delving into these primary keywords, you have to understand the basic concepts associated with Python. These concepts are necessary to understand every other aspect of the scripting language. By reading this book, you're off to a great start. It is designed to ease your way into Python programming world. So, Ready to Become a Master of Python?  Get Customers Addicted to Your Store!

Data science is a process which is used to extract the knowledge from massive amount of data. The data may be structured, unstructured, machine language based, graphs, audio, video, image and streaming data. Data science is introduced to perform the statistics, data analysis in order to understand and analyses the data to get maximum insight from that. Structured data is information that relies upon an information model and dwells in a fixed field inside a record. In that capacity, it's simple to store organized information in tables inside data sets or Excel documents. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the favoured method to oversee and get the information in the table. In the unstructured data, the information not in the rows and columns. It has the information that is not easily fit into the data model for processing that.

The world of programming may have started quite some time ago; it was only a couple of decades ago that it gained attention from computer experts from across the globe. This sudden shift saw some great minds who contributed to the entire age of programming far greater than most. We saw the great GNU project take shape during this era. We came across the rather brilliant Linux. New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost. While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world. Immediately, coding became so much easier for programmers. The use of this language started gaining momentum, and today, it is set to overtake the only language that stands before it to claim the prestigious spot of being the world's most favored language. This language was the brainchild of Guido Van Rossum. Created in the year 1991, Python has become a byword for efficient and user-friendly programming. This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for. Naturally, the language was received well by the programming community. Today, it is one of the most important languages for both professionals and students who aim to excel in fields like Machine Learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and so much more. With real-life examples showing a wide variety of use, Python is now living and breathing in almost every major social platform, web application, and website. All of this sounds interesting and exciting at the same time, but what if you have no prior knowledge about programming? What if you have no understanding of basic concepts and you wish to learn Python? This book covers: Python - The First ImpressionsGetting ready for PythonThe world of Variables and OperatorsMaking Your Program InteractiveList, Tuples and dictionariesFunctions and ModulesWorking with FilesObject Oriented ProgrammingAnd much more.I am happy to report that this book will provide you with every possible chance of learning Python and allow you to jump-start your journey into the world of programming. This book is ideally meant for people who have zero understanding of programming and/or may have never coded a single line of program before.I will walk you through all the basic steps from installation to application. We will look into various aspects of the language and hopefully provide you with real-life examples to further explain the importance of such aspects. The idea of this book is to prepare you as you learn the core concepts of Python. Buy It Now and Let Your Customers Get Addicted To This Amazing Book

They collect all manner of data at each point of interaction with their customers. Data are useful in several ways. The companies learn more about their customers, thereafter clustering them according to their specific needs. Through such segmentation, the company can attend to the customers' needs better and hope to keep them satisfied for longer. But data analytics is not just about customers and the profit motive. It is also about governance. Governments are the biggest data consumers all over the world. They collect data about citizens, businesses, and every other entity that they interact with at any given point. This is important information because it helps in a lot of instances. For planning purposes, governments need accurate data on their population so that funds can be allocated accordingly. Equitable distribution of resources is something that cannot be achieved without proper Data Analysis. Other than planning, there is also the security angle. To protect the country, the government must maintain different databases for different reasons. There are high profile individuals who must be accorded special security detail, top threats who must be monitored at all times, and so forth. To meet the security objective, the government has to obtain and maintain updated data on persons of interest at all times. There is so much more to Data Analysis than the corporate and government decisions. As a programmer, you are venturing into an industry that is challenging and exciting at the same time. Data doesn't lie unless it is manipulated, in which case you need insane Data Analysis and handling skills. As a data analyst, you will come across many challenges and problems that need solutions that can only be handled through Data Analysis.

The world of programming may have started quite some time ago; it was only a couple of decades ago that it gained attention from computer experts from across the globe. This sudden shift saw some great minds who contributed to the entire age of programming far greater than most. We saw the great GNU project take shape during this era. We came across the rather brilliant Linux. New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost. While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world. Immediately, coding became so much easier for programmers. The use of this language started gaining momentum, and today, it is set to overtake the only language that stands before it to claim the prestigious spot of being the world's most favored language. This language was the brainchild of Guido Van Rossum. Created in the year 1991, Python has become a byword for efficient and user-friendly programming. This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for. Naturally, the language was received well by the programming community. Today, it is one of the most important languages for both professionals and students who aim to excel in fields like Machine Learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and so much more. With real-life examples showing a wide variety of use, Python is now living and breathing in almost every major social platform, web application, and website. All of this sounds interesting and exciting at the same time, but what if you have no prior knowledge about programming? What if you have no understanding of basic concepts and you wish to learn Python? This book covers: Python - The First ImpressionsGetting ready for PythonThe world of Variables and OperatorsMaking Your Program InteractiveList, Tuples and dictionariesFunctions and ModulesWorking with FilesObject Oriented ProgrammingAnd much more.I am happy to report that this book will provide you with every possible chance of learning Python and allow you to jump-start your journey into the world of programming. This book is ideally meant for people who have zero understanding of programming and/or may have never coded a single line of program before.I will walk you through all the basic steps from installation to application. We will look into various aspects of the language and hopefully provide you with real-life examples to further explain the importance of such aspects.

This textbook grew out of notes for the ECE143 Programming for Data Analysis class that the author has been teaching at University of California, San Diego, which is a requirement for both graduate and undergraduate degrees in Machine Learning and Data Science. This book is ideal for readers with some Python programming experience. The book covers key language concepts that must be understood to program effectively, especially for data analysis applications. Certain low-level language features are discussed in detail, especially Python memory management and data structures. Using Python effectively means taking advantage of its vast ecosystem. The book discusses Python package management and how to use third-party modules as well as how to structure your own Python modules. The section on object-oriented programming explains features of the language that facilitate common programming patterns.After developing the key Python language features, the book moves on to third-party modules that are foundational for effective data analysis, starting with Numpy. The book develops key Numpy concepts and discusses internal Numpy array data structures and memory usage. Then, the author moves onto Pandas and details its many features for data processing and alignment. Because strong visualizations are important for communicating data analysis, key modules such as Matplotlib are developed in detail, along with web-based options such as Bokeh, Holoviews, Altair, and Plotly.The text is sprinkled with many tricks-of-the-trade that help avoid common pitfalls. The author explains the internal logic embodied in the Python language so that readers can get into the Python mindset and make better design choices in their codes, which is especially helpful for newcomers to both Python and data analysis. To get the most out of this book, open a Python interpreter and type along with the many code samples.

Applied Evolutionary Algorithms for Engineers Using Python,https://www.kingstone.com.tw//basic/203c108127550?zone=english&lid=search&actid=WISE&kw=Python&pi=6,"Leonardo Azevedo,Scardua",CRC Press,https://cdn.kingstone.com.tw/english/images/product/3133/9780367263133.jpg,9780367263133.0,"

This book meant for those who seek to apply evolutionary algorithms to problems in engineering and science. To this end, it provides the theoretical background necessary to the understanding of the presented evolutionary algorithms and their shortcomings, while also discussing themes that are pivotal to the successful application of evolutionary algorithms to real-world problems. The theoretical descriptions are illustrated with didactical Python implementations of the algorithms, which not only allow readers to consolidate their understanding, but also provide a sound starting point for those intending to apply evolutionary algorithms to optimization problems in their working fields. Python has been chosen due to its widespread adoption in the Artificial Intelligence community. Those familiar with high level languages such as MATLAB(TM) will not have any difficulty in reading the Python implementations of the evolutionary algorithms provided in the book.Instead of attempting to encompass most of the existing evolutionary algorithms, past and present, the book focuses on those algorithms that researchers have recently applied to difficult optimization problems, such as control problems with continuous action spaces and the training of high-dimensional convolutional neural-networks. The basic characteristics of real-world optimization problems are presented, together with recommendations on its proper application to evolutionary algorithms. The applied nature of the book is reinforced by the presentation of successful cases of the application of evolutionary algorithms to optimization problems. This is complemented by Python source codes, giving users an insight into the idiosyncrasies of the practical application of evolutionary algorithms.

Includes 3 manuscriptsLearn Python Programming In today's Industry, Python Programming is highly recommended for developing Websites. The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it.Python Coding and ProgrammingPython is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook.It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their developmentpython codingWandering how to learn everything on Python Programming right from the beginning? The next few lines can tell you something! Learning Python is one of the 21st century specialties you can have right now. You know how to code with Python, you become one of the most relevant citizens of the computer age. You can access neural networks, interpret, understand, code and decode certain special languages of a computer. So in order to be relevant, you need a program like python. And what is Python? Python is a specialized computer program that is used to code data into a computer. It supplies information into the computer in a specialized language. The computer then works on that information to produce desired response. This is exactly what is called Coding. So, Python is a very famous program used to code a computer. It can be used to perform various activities, ranging from basic mathematical calculations to website coding and data processing. Also computing an A. I. software. This field used to be restricted to Computer scientists, Engineers, Technicians and related fields originally. But today, everyone programs a computer and you can't afford not belonging to thatclass for long. Learning Python programming is your pathway to understanding neural networks and coding information

The world of programming may have started quite some time ago; it was only a couple of decades ago that it gained attention from computer experts from across the globe. This sudden shift saw some great minds who contributed to the entire age of programming far greater than most. We saw the great GNU project take shape during this era. We came across the rather brilliant Linux. New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost.While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world. Immediately, coding became so much easier for programmers. The use of this language started gaining momentum, and today, it is set to overtake the only language that stands before it to claim the prestigious spot of being the world's most favored language.This language was the brainchild of Guido Van Rossum. Created in the year 1991, Python has become a byword for efficient and user-friendly programming. This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for.

This sudden shift saw some great minds who contributed to the entire age of programming far greater than most. We saw the great GNU project take shape during this era. We came across the rather brilliant Linux. New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost.While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world. Immediately, coding became so much easier for programmers. The use of this language started gaining momentum, and today, it is set to overtake the only language that stands before it to claim the prestigious spot of being the world's most favored language.This language was the brainchild of Guido Van Rossum. Created in the year 1991, Python has become a byword for efficient and user-friendly programming. This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for.

New programming languages were born as well, and people certainly enjoyed these to the utmost.While most of these programming languages worked, there was something that was missing. Surely, something could be done to make coding a less tedious task to do and carry out. That is exactly what a revolutionary new language, named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, did for the world. Immediately, coding became so much easier for programmers. The use of this language started gaining momentum, and today, it is set to overtake the only language that stands before it to claim the prestigious spot of being the world's most favored language.This language was the brainchild of Guido Van Rossum. Created in the year 1991, Python has become a byword for efficient and user-friendly programming. This language is what connected the dots and gave programmers the much-needed ease of coding that they have since been yearning for. Naturally, the language was received well by the programming community. Today, it is one of the most important languages for both professionals and students who aim to excel in fields like Machine Learning, automation, artificial intelligence, and so much more.This book covers: - Python - The First Impressions- Getting ready for Python- The world of Variables and Operators- Making Your Program Interactive- List, Tuples and dictionaries- Functions and Modules- Working with Files- Object Oriented ProgrammingAnd much more.Ready to get started?

From the moment you wake up, you interact with data at different levels. A lot of important decisions are made based on data analytics. Companies need data to help them meet many of their goals. As the population of the world keeps growing, its customer base keeps expanding. In light of this, they must find ways of keeping their customers happy while at the same time meeting their business goals. Given the nature of competition in the business world, it is not easy to keep customers happy. Competitors keep preying on each other's customers, and those who win have another challenge ahead - how to maintain the customers lest they slide back to their former business partners. This is one area where Data Analysis comes in handy. This book covers: What is Data AnalysisPython Crash CourseData MungingWhy Data Preprocessing Is ImportantWhat is Data Wrangling?Inheritances to Clean Up the CodeReading and writing dataThe Different Types of Data We Can Work WithThe Importance of Data VisualizationIndexing and selecting arraysCommon Debugging ToolsNeural Network and What to Use for?And much more.To understand their customers better, companies rely on data. They collect all manner of data at each point of interaction with their customers. Data are useful in several ways. The companies learn more about their customers, thereafter clustering them according to their specific needs. Through such segmentation, the company can attend to the customers' needs better and hope to keep them satisfied for longer. But data analytics is not just about customers and the profit motive. It is also about governance. Governments are the biggest data consumers all over the world. They collect data about citizens, businesses, and every other entity that they interact with at any given point. This is important information because it helps in a lot of instances. For planning purposes, governments need accurate data on their population so that funds can be allocated accordingly. Equitable distribution of resources is something that cannot be achieved without proper Data Analysis. Other than planning, there is also the security angle. To protect the country, the government must maintain different databases for different reasons. There are high profile individuals who must be accorded special security detail, top threats who must be monitored at all times, and so forth. To meet the security objective, the government has to obtain and maintain updated data on persons of interest at all times. There is so much more to Data Analysis than the corporate and government decisions. As a programmer, you are venturing into an industry that is challenging and exciting at the same time. Data doesn't lie unless it is manipulated, in which case you need insane Data Analysis and handling skills. As a data analyst, you will come across many challenges and problems that need solutions that can only be handled through Data Analysis. The way you interact with data can make a big difference, bigger than you can imagine. Buy It Now and Let Your Customers Get Addicted To This Amazing Book

Writing and running software is now as much a part of science as telescopes and test tubes, but most researchers are never taught how to do either well. As a result, it takes them longer to accomplish simple tasks than it should, and it is harder for them to share their work with others than it needs to be.This book introduces the concepts, tools, and skills that researchers need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Based on the practical experiences of its authors, who collectively have spent several decades teaching software skills to scientists, it covers everything graduate-level researchers need to automate their workflows, collaborate with colleagues, ensure that their results are trustworthy, and publish what they have built so that others can build on it. The book assumes only a basic knowledge of Python as a starting point, and shows readers how it, the Unix shell, Git, Make, and related tools can give them more time to focus on the research they actually want to do.Research Software Engineering with Python: Building software that makes research possible can be used as the main text in a one-semester course or for self-guided study. A running example shows how to organize a small research project step by step; over a hundred exercises give readers a chance to practice these skills themselves, while a glossary defining over two hundred terms will help readers find their way through the terminology. All of the material can be re-used under a Creative Commons license, and all royalties from sales of the book will be donated to The Carpentries, an organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

Develop your Python Skills, Unlock Opportunities  You may be a beginner Python programmer looking to upgrade your skills, or a seasoned professional brushing up on what you already know. Whatever your level of expertise, this book was written with you in mind. I recall looking for a simply-written Python programming guide when I needed it. Despite my best effort, I couldn't find one. The books that I did find catered to just one category of programmers whether they be novices or experts. Or it focused on a singular theme, such as web development or networking. Almost all programmers I knew faced the same dilemma. As they say, ""Need is the mother of invention."" It was then that I decided to write a book on Python myself. In this 2-in-1 book, you will find:  - Simplicity:  It is written in a very concise and approachable way - Coaching:  All instructions are presented in a linear, step-by-step format- Detail:  Its scope is to comprehensively address both novices and experts- Structure:  Information is clearly organized into chapters and sections - Two Books:  A Python crash course and a Python data analysis course  Python is an amazing programming language. Its code syntax is so simple that it almost reads like a natural language. It is relatively easier to deploy, debug and maintain.  You might assume that a book on Python, one equally tailored for beginners as well as experts, would be filled with jargon and code. While the code must still be present, I have spent an inordinate amount of time making the book as simple and easy to read as possible. You may want to launch your programming career, start a software development business or work for a large corporation and impress them with your Python skills. In any case, you need to get this book.

Why should you start learning Python? Is Python the only way to go if you are interested in programming?  Python programming has become a must-learn skill in the Data Science domain. It has evolved as the most preferred programming language for data-driven development because it is suitable for many data science tasks and is easy to learn compared to other programming languages.In short, Python is the closest programming language to fit the goal of a beginner and a great starting place. However, Python is not the silver bullet for all problems. It certainly fits good for many purposes but it less fits for others.

We, all in all, understand that Siri, Google Now, and Cortana are generally adroit propelled individual accomplices on various stages (iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). Basically, they help discover important information when you demand it is using your voice; you can say ""Where's the nearest Indian restaurant?"", ""What's on my schedule today?"" ""Remind me to call Mom or Dad at eight o'clock,"" and the partner will respond by finding information, giving off information from your phone, or sending headings to various applications. Reproduced knowledge is noteworthy in these applications, as they accumulate information on your sales and use that information to all the more probable see your talk and serve you results that are specially designed to your tendencies. Microsoft says that Cortana ""determinedly gets some answers concerning its customer"" and that it will, at last, develop the ability to imagine customers' needs. Virtual individual associates process a huge proportion of data from an arrangement of sources to get some answers concerning customers and be progressively convincing in helping them sort out and track their information. Your mobile phone, analyst, PC games, vehicle, bank, and your home all usage man-made thinking each day; every so often, it's prominent what it's doing, like when you ask Siri to get your orientation to the nearest administration station. To a great extent it's increasingly unobtrusive, like when you make a peculiar purchase on your Mastercard and don't get a deception alert from your bank. Man-made consciousness is everywhere, and it's created a huge complexity in our lives every day. Thusly, we can say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the piece of PC sciences that underlines the headway of knowledge machines, thinking, and working as individuals. For example, talk affirmation, basic reasoning, learning, and orchestrating. Today, Artificial Intelligence is an outstanding subject that is by and large inspected in the advancement and business circles. Various masters and industry specialists battle that AI or AI is the future - yet in case we look around, we are induced that it's not the future - it is the present.

Lіkе оthеr іntеrрrеtаtіvе lаnguаgеѕ, it іѕ more flexible than соmріlеd lаnguаgеѕ, аnd іt can bе used tо tіе disparate ѕуѕtеmѕ tоgеthеr. Indeed, Python is a versatile lаnguаgе with mаnу applications іn grоwіng fіеldѕ. Fоr example, Python іѕ a рорulаr рrоgrаmmіng language fоr educational ѕоftwаrе. Raspberry Pi, thе ѕіnglе-bоаrd соmрutеr project fоr tеасhіng ѕtudеntѕ соmрutеr рrоgrаmmіng, uses Python as іtѕ рrіmаrу рrоgrаmmіng language. In addition, much оf thе ѕоftwаrе for thе One Laptop per Child XO іѕ wrіttеn in Pуthоn. At thе оthеr еnd оf the educational spectrum, Pуthоn іѕ аlѕо a very еffесtіvе language for scientific соmрutіng аnd mathematical ѕоftwаrе fоr theoretical mathematics.

Are you looking for a crash course about Python for Data Science? Do you also want to come up easily with your first project in no time? Are you constantly looking for information on social networks (like FB groups) and you don't know where to start with Python programming? If so, then keep on reading!Python is nowadays often used in data science because it is a mature programming language that has excellent properties for beginning programmers. Some of the most notable of these properties are the easy-to-read password, suppression of optional delimiters, dynamic writing, and use of dynamic memory.Data science uses science strategies to process data and separate information from it. It moves away from an idea similar to Big Data and Data Mining. It requires innovative equipment along with useful calculation and programming to deal with data problems or process data to gain substantial learning from them.The improvement and highly useful research in the world of Computing and Technology have increased the importance of its most basic and essential concepts in a thousand aspects. This notion of principle is what we continuously refer to as data, and that data is the only thing that ""opens the way"" for everything in the world. The world's largest organizations and companies have built their creation and their philosophies and determine a unique portion of their pay through data.

	．逐步說明的實戰範例，輕鬆學會網站爬蟲技巧。
	．清楚分類網站類型，系統性了解網站全貌。
	．多語言開發技巧，快速提升程式開發能力。
	．多元開發技巧，節省自行搜尋與研究時間。

	本書著重多語言操作應用（Excel VBA、Python、JavaScript）與多解法開發爬蟲程式、網路封包側錄分析、網站資料尋找分析，有別於坊間爬蟲書籍僅以Python作為爬蟲操作語言與單一方式解決問題的作法。

著重原理與觀念，多角度學習，效果更佳
	承襲《Excel VBA 實戰技巧｜金融數據x網路爬蟲》中提過的觀念，「爬蟲原理與觀念通了，任何程式語言都可以做爬蟲程式」與多元開發的精神。本書在加入Python後，並以Python常見的爬蟲模組來解決同一個爬蟲問題，讓讀者可從多角度去學習Python與爬蟲程式的開發技巧。

JavsScript加密混淆破解技法大公開
	JavaScript對於網頁是非常重要的腳本語言，而讀者遇到以JavaScript做加密、混淆、美化等技巧的網頁，往往就望之興嘆無法再進行分析與開發爬蟲，藉由Excel VBA、Python對JavaScript操作範例練習，讓讀者面對相關網頁不再裹足不前。

針對封包側錄與發送過程進行詳細的探討與解說
	封包分析是開發爬蟲程式最重要的一環，若封包側錄、分析、發送等環節出錯，將會導致開發爬蟲程式出現嚴重錯誤，陷入「一步錯步步錯」的窘境，要解決此問題就必須對封包發送內容能清楚掌握，本書針對封包側錄與發送過程進行詳細的探討與解說，透過工具設定與操作，明確封包內容資訊，進一步提升爬蟲分析能力。

	分析網站資料產生的流程，分成網頁操作、封包側錄與分析、連線測試等階段，將每個階段的特徵記錄、整理、歸納而成「網頁操作分析表」，讓讀者在分析網站能一目了然網頁全貌，可避免分析了後面忘了前面的分析，導致開發爬蟲程式遺漏了關鍵步驟而造成無法抓取網頁資料。

We, all in all, understand that Siri, Google Now, and Cortana are generally adroit propelled individual accomplices on various stages (iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). Basically, they help discover important information when you demand it is using your voice; you can say ""Where's the nearest Indian restaurant?"", ""What's on my schedule today?"" ""Remind me to call Mom or Dad at eight o'clock,"" and the partner will respond by finding information, giving off information from your phone, or sending headings to various applications. Reproduced knowledge is noteworthy in these applications, as they accumulate information on your sales and use that information to all the more probable see your talk and serve you results that are specially designed to your tendencies. Microsoft says that Cortana ""determinedly gets some answers concerning its customer"" and that it will, at last, develop the ability to imagine customers' needs. Virtual individual associates process a huge proportion of data from an arrangement of sources to get some answers concerning customers and be progressively convincing in helping them sort out and track their information. Your mobile phone, analyst, PC games, vehicle, bank, and your home all usage man-made thinking each day; every so often, it's prominent what it's doing, like when you ask Siri to get your orientation to the nearest administration station. To a great extent it's increasingly unobtrusive, like when you make a peculiar purchase on your Mastercard and don't get a deception alert from your bank. Man-made consciousness is everywhere, and it's created a huge complexity in our lives every day. Thusly, we can say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the piece of PC sciences that underlines the headway of knowledge machines, thinking, and working as individuals. For example, talk affirmation, basic reasoning, learning, and orchestrating. Today, Artificial Intelligence is an outstanding subject that is by and large inspected in the advancement and business circles. Various masters and industry specialists battle that AI or AI is the future - yet in case we look around, we are induced that it's not the future - it is the present.

In the early 1980s, Python was designed. Initially, Python did not make its mark in the industry as intended due to the absence of adequate marketing. It also had some inbuilt problems relating to the key idea, which worked as an obstacle in its successful route.With renovation by Google within the twentieth century, improvements were seen in Python, as some needed modifications where made in its set-up and settings.As a consequence, it has acquired the authority and efficiency within itself. Google altered the language's key logic and also removed all of the library's repeated modules and techniques to make it smoother and lighter.Its efficiency has now improved more than three times than before. It, therefore, becomes one of the industry's most powerful languages,  gaining tremendous popularity among developers and tech experts over the past decade, turning out to be a gem in the IT industry.Today, many programming languages exist. Some are being used, and some are now deemed outdated. The programming situation has altered dramatically over the past few years as designers and programmers are looking for more universal and accessible languages, and this is why the language of Python has lately become so popular.The Python community is increasing day by day, as many programmers find it one of the most user-friendly programming languages.Python's development today involves different individuals with a broad spectrum of backgrounds, ages, and instructional levels - whether you're a student, a computer designer, a housewife, or a retiree, you can be a part of the process.There are always some thorough guidelines to make your introduction to the subject easier and more sustainable to ensure your success. Much guidance can be found on the Internet.If you are starting with programming and have no knowledge about computers and programming, this book is written for you.You will find initial chapters easier to understand and as you progress to later chapters, you will have better skills and we will cover more advanced topics.This book is written in one flow and it's better not to skip any topic, let alone an entire chapter.This book gives a comprehensive guide on the following: The basic background of pythonData types in pythonOperators - the types and their usesLoops and functionsException handlingVariable scope and lifetime in python functionsModulesWorking with filesObject-oriented programmingReal-world examples of pythonGetting started; python tips and tricksCommon programming challenges... AND MORE!!!However, you can get to know some starting points and steps once you purchase this book.

Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython? SettingiUp the Environment in PythonK - Nearest Neighbor AlgorithmsMeans ClusteringNeural Networks - Linear ClassifiersWhile most books focus on advanced predictive models, this book begins to explain the basic concepts and how to correctly implement Data Science and Machine Learning, with practical examples and simple coding scripts. This guide provides the necessary knowledge in a practical way.

Do you want to learn the basics concepts of Phyton coding? Do you want to know more about Phyton and make things work in no time? Then this book is for you!The first thing we need to look at here is the keywords. These seem pretty straightforward, but it is so important to understand that they tell the compiler how it needs to act and behave with the projects that you are doing. These keywords are ones that are reserved to tell the compiler what it needs to do. Since they are reserved, the computer programmer needs to remember to use them properly so that the compiler can take that command and get things done. You need only to use them in the specified parts of the code, or it leads to error messages and other problems. If you properly use them, the compiler will be given command of what you want it to do, and it can then execute the code in the right way. These words are essential to the whole code and learning what they are is going to make code writing more comfortable as well. You will be able to notice a lot of these keywords as we progress through this guidebook and write some of our codes. This book contains: Python Programming BasicsWhat Is Scikit-Learn, And Why Should I Learn About It?Essential Libraries And Tools In PythonModulesMachine Learning DatasetsTraining Simple Machine Learning Algorithms For ClassificationUnsupervised Machine LearningLearning In Artificial Neural NetworksAnd many more!Learning to code can seem complicated but it is not!

This book is the perfect guide for people who want to learn about Phyton programming, in particular its application for data science.There are so many great ways that you can use the data you have been collecting for some time now, and being able to complete the process of data visualization will ensure that you get it all done, when you are ready to get started with Python data science.This guide book contains: What Is Data Science And Why Should You Learn It Using PythonCan I Use Probability And Statistics To Help Me With Machine Learning?Work With NumpyWork With PandasLearning About FunctionsIdentifying The Nearest NeighborsLearning About FunctionsDeep Learning Vs Machine LearningApplications Of Big Data AnalysisAnd many more!Loops are going to be next on the list of topics we need to explore when we are working with Python.These are going to be a great way to clean up some of the code that you are working on so that you can add in a ton of information and processing in the code, without having to go through the process of writing out all those lines of code. For example, if you would like a program that would count out all of the numbers that go from one to one hundred, you would not want to write out that many lines of code along the way. Or if you would like to create a program for doing a multiplication table, this would take forever as well. But doing a loop can help to get all of this done in just a few lines of code, saving you a lot of time and code writing in the process. Want to know more about this book?

It has become extremely popular over the past decade, thanks to its intuitive nature, flexibility, and versatility. Python can be used on a wide variety of operating systems, and its clean, readable code style makes it relatively beginner-friendly, while not as fast as other languages, such as C++ or JAVA, Python code is often much shorter and simpler than other languages. Python also supports several packages and modules created by other developers to make the development of Python applications quicker and easier. There are hundreds of different programming languages out there in the world, with Wikipedia listing over 700 notable languages. Given how many languages you could potentially learn, why learn Python? Python has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years, driven by several aspects that make it an incredibly versatile and intuitive language. A huge selling point of Python is the cleanliness and readability of its syntax and structure. Commands in Python can often be carried out using simple English keywords, which makes the language much more intuitive than many other languages. Python is also quite versatile in the sense that it supports both structured programming and object-oriented programming approaches. Python even allows the use of certain aspects of functional programming. This Book Covers: Understanding PythonWhy the name ""Python""?Python GlossaryPython InstallationPython Data TypesAnd much more!!Despite its simplicity, Python is also sturdy and robust enough to carry out complex scientific and mathematical tasks.

Are you new to software development? Are you curious about learning what artificial intelligence is? Do you want to master the Phyton programming language? Well, this book is your best choice! There may be a lot of different languages that you can work with when it comes to the coding that you would like to work with, but none are going to provide you with the benefits that you are working with. This language is so popular and used so often that there are a few different operating systems that already have some version of Python found on them for you to use. This can make it easier to get some of the coding done that you would like, and will ensure that you will get the best benefits out of it in no time. This book covers:  - What Is Python and His History and Why Learn Python- Getting Started with Python- Variables and Operators- Basic Operators- Data Types in PythonAnd so much more!!The Python language is more natural to read: If you take a look through some of the codes that we have later on in this guidebook, you will find that this is an easy task to read through some of the different parts of the law. Even if you have not been able to work with this language before, you will still be able to look at some of the systems and notice that you recognize the parts as well. The program is open source. This means that you won't have to worry about someone taking over the code and ruining it. It also means that the original Python is free and available to anyone who wants to download it. If you are curious about this world, get this book today!

Bachelorarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Informatik - K羹nstliche Intelligenz, Note: 1,0, Fachhochschule Amberg-Weiden, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: In dieser Arbeit sollte mittels Deep Learning ein Modell erstellt werden, mit dem sich die Auslastung eines Servers in einem Rechenzentrum vorhersagen l瓣sst. Daf羹r sollte evaluiert werden, welche Modell-Architektur f羹r diese Zeitreihenvorhersage am besten geeignet sind. Daf羹r wurde zun瓣chst eine theoretische Untersuchung durchgef羹hrt und anschlie?end ein Vergleich der geeigneten Modell-Architekturen angestellt. Es stellte sich heraus, dass ein Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) mit einer Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Schicht die besten Prognosen erzeugt. Es wurde untersucht, wie sich die Hauptkomponentenanalyse zur Dimensionsreduktion auf die Modelle auswirkt. Dies zeigte, dass die Effekte stark von der Architektur abh瓣ngen. Die System-Architektur einer Webanwendung wurde so erweitert, dass es m繹glich ist, neben der historischen Serverauslastung auch Prognosen anzuzeigen. Die Visualisierungen der aufgezeichneten Daten wurden um die Vorhersagen erweitert. Die Arbeit stellt schlie?lich eine M繹glichkeit dar, wie der Lebenszyklus des Prognosemodells in einem produktiven System mit stetiger Auslastungsmessung integriert werden kann.

Do you Want to learn more about Python Machine Learning ?.... then read on.Machine learning stems from this question: Can a computer go beyond anything we can order to do and learn by itself to do a specific task? Can a laptop surprise us? Instead of having programmers carefully and manually writing a set of data processing rules, can a computer automatically learn these rules by merely looking at the data?This question paves the way for a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, on which symbolic artificial intelligence is based, human beings insert rules (the program) and the data to be processed according to these rules and obtain answers. Humans enter data and expected responses based on that data with machine learning, and the computer identifies the practices. These rules can then be applied to other data to produce different, original answers.A machine learning system is trained and not programmed. He is presented with numerous examples relevant to a given task. In these examples, he finds a statistical structure that ultimately allows him to produce the rules for the task's automation. For example, to automate tagging vacation photographs, many examples of images already tagged by humans could be presented to a machine learning system. The system would be tasked with learning the statistical rules based on associating individual images with specific tags.  Machine learning is closely related to statistics, but it differs from them in many important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to operate with large and complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would not be usable. . As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits somewhat limited mathematical theory - sometimes too much - and is more technical than mathematical. It is a practical discipline in which ideas often prove more empirically than theoretical.In this Book you will learning: What is Data Science and Deep Learning?Data Science and ApplicationsProbability - Fundamental - Statistics Understanding the Fundamentals of iMachine LearningTypes of MachineiLearningWhat is iPython? SettingiUp the Environment in PythonK - Nearest Neighbor AlgorithmsMeans ClusteringNeural Networks - Linear ClassifiersWhile most books focus on advanced predictive models, this book begins to explain the basic concepts and how to correctly implement Data Science and Machine Learning, with practical examples and simple coding scripts.

Do you want a job in Data? You shouldn't think twice about it. Learn SQL!Knowing the fundamentals of a more general-purpose language like Python or R is critical, BUT ignoring SQL will make it much harder to get a data related job. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems. It's in high demand because so many companies are using it. And it's not just tech companies: companies big and small use SQL. For instance, a quick job search on LinkedIn will show you that more companies are looking for SQL skills than are looking for Python or R skills. SQL may have been existing for a long time, but it's still found everywhere.All you need to know about Structured Query Language (SQL) - The first language of data analysis is in this book!If you learn SQL, you are not likely to spend a lot of time on the job searching market. A good place to start will be to dig into some Database theory, then this book is a good starting point. This will provide you with the set of tools you'll need when dealing with various SQL tasks in the future.Here are some previews what you'll learn in this book: The fundamentals of SQLBasic Commands That Work Well in SQLRelational Database Management SystemsDatabases, Syntax and Datatypes in SQLWorking with Indexing, Views and QueriesOperatorsManaging objectsHow to use SQL in real world situationsAnd much, much more!Now that you have seen a few of the many perks of becoming a dab hand at working with SQL, you probably want to begin your journey as soon as possible!

Your program needs to be written differently to take advantage of that.Modern Tkinter shows you the right way to do it.You'll learn all the modern best practices. You'll build your user interface the right way the first time, without having to learn anything extra or irrelevant. It starts at the beginning, shows you what you need to know, and covers all the essential elements of building your modern user interface. This includes: all the standard GUI widgetsattractively laying out your user interfacemanaging menus, windows, and standard dialogsorganizing more complex user interfacesTkinter's powerhouse widgets: canvas and textcustomizing the look of your user interfacemaking it all work on Mac, Windows, and LinuxYou may have been using older documentation, or are trying to update a Tkinter program written years ago. If so, you'll find warnings of what to avoid using, and how to replace it with a modern solution. There's even a full case study of modernizing the user interface of a seriously out-of-date Tkinter application you may be familiar with.Who this book is forThis book is for everyday Python programmers looking to quickly create desktop user interfaces. You may be new to Tkinter, or want to bring your knowledge up to date. You don't need to be an expert on OOP, MVC architecture, multithreading or any other advanced topics. In fact, you're not going to see any of those things in this book.This book uses Python 3.9, but everything you learn will apply (with small tweaks) to any Python 3.x version. It won't help you if you're using Python 2.x.Let veteran software developer Mark Roseman show you the right way to build user interfaces with Python and Tkinter. He's been using and Tk (the technology behind Tkinter) since its early days and has shipped dozens of open source tools and commercial applications based on it.He's also the author of the multi-lingual TkDocs website, the de facto reference for building modern Tk user interfaces. This book brings together Python-specific information from that site and supports its further development.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site.The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal deﬁnition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's ﬂavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index. The Glossary is also worth going through. This fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time.

Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.

This book builds on basic Python tutorials to explain various Python language features that aren't routinely covered: from reusable console scripts that play double duty as micro-services by leveraging entry points, to using asyncio efficiently to collate data from a large number of sources. Along the way, it covers type-hint based linting, low-overhead testing and other automated quality checking to demonstrate a robust real-world development process.Some powerful aspects of Python are often documented with contrived examples that explain the feature as a standalone example only. By following the design and build of a real-world application example from prototype to production quality you'll see not only how the various pieces of functionality work but how they integrate as part of the larger system design process. In addition, you'll benefit from the kind of useful asides and library recommendations that are a staple of conference Q&A sessions at Python conferences as well as discussions of modern Python best practice and techniques to better produce clear code that is easily maintainable.Advanced Python Development is intended for developers who can already write simple programs in Python and want to understand when it's appropriate to use new and advanced language features and to do so in a confident manner. It is especially of use to developers looking to progress to a more senior level and to very experienced developers who have thus far used older versions of Python. What You'll Learn Understand asynchronous programmingExamine developing plugin architecturesWork with type annotationsReview testing techniquesExplore packaging and dependency managementWho This Book Is ForDevelopers at the mid to senior level who already have Python experience.

This book provides the tools for analyzing data in Python: different types of filters are introduced and explained, such as FIR-, IIR- and morphological filters, as well as their application to one- and two-dimensional data. The required mathematics are kept to a minimum, and numerous examples and working Python programs are included for a quick start. The goal of the book is to enable also novice users to choose appropriate methods and to complete real-world tasks such as differentiation, integration, and smoothing of time series, or simple edge detection in images. An introductory section provides help and tips for getting Python installed and configured on your computer. More advanced chapters provide a practical introduction to the Fourier transform and its applications such as sound processing, as well as to the solution of equations of motion with the Laplace transform. A brief excursion into machine learning shows the powerful tools that are available with Python. This book also provides tips for an efficient programming work flow: from the use of a debugger for finding mistakes, code-versioning with git to avoid the loss of working programs, to the construction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the visualization of data. Working, well-documented Python solutions are included for all exercises, and IPython/Jupyter notebooks provide additional help to get people started and outlooks for the interested reader.

Discover the concepts of creating dynamic web pages (HTML) with Python. This book reviews several methods available to serve up dynamic HTML including CGI, SSI, Django, and Flask. You will start by covering HTML pages and CSS in general and then move on to creating pages via CGI. It is easy to use and can serve as a foundation for the more advanced services available for launching dynamic web pages. Next you'll explore the SSI (Server Side Interface) method. This is a slightly more advanced interface included in mots web servers that adds functionality to modify static HTML pages to add such things as the current date or time, include additional HTML, and other features to a static web page before it is delivered to the user. The book also covers some of the key the Django module features, which must be added to the web server. These features include creating dynamic web pages and calling a database to provide additional information to the web page. Lastly you will explore the Flask module. While it has limited functionality on its own, it provides a very flexible environment to create a self designed system for delivery of dynamic web pages.By the time you finish this book, you will be able to choose the appropriate methodology for delivering dynamic information using fast HTML creation services.What You'll LearnUse HTML pages and CSS together to control the style of your web site.Install and configure SSI, Django, and Flask for Apache.Create dynamic web pages using CGI and creating a library of partial HTML pages to use in this task.Build dynamic web pages using SSI and auxiliary Python programs to enhance the SSI functionality.Develop dynamic web pages using Django.Who This Book Is ForSoftware Developers with basic Python programming skills interested in learning Web Development

Other benefits of python are: Good quality documentation, Platform agnostic, Easy and fast to learn in comparison to any other OOP (object oriented programming) language. Python has many image intensive libraries like Python Imaging Library, VTK and Maya 3D Visualization Toolkits, Numeric Python, Scientific Python and many other tools available for numeric and scientific applications.Python is very well designed, fast, robust, portable, and scalable. These are evidently the most important factors for AI applications. Useful for a really broad range of programming tasks from little shell scripts to enterprise web applications to scientific uses. Last but not the least, it is Open Source! Good community support available for the same.

This book, fully updated for Python version 3.6+, covers the key ideas that link probability, statistics, and machine learning illustrated using Python modules in these areas. All the figures and numerical results are reproducible using the Python codes provided. The author develops key intuitions in machine learning by working meaningful examples using multiple analytical methods and Python codes, thereby connecting theoretical concepts to concrete implementations. Detailed proofs for certain important results are also provided. Modern Python modules like Pandas, Sympy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras are applied to simulate and visualize important machine learning concepts like the bias/variance trade-off, cross-validation, and regularization. Many abstract mathematical ideas, such as convergence in probability theory, are developed and illustrated with numerical examples. This updated edition now includes the Fisher Exact Test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test. A new section on survival analysis has been included as well as substantial development of Generalized Linear Models. The new deep learning section for image processing includes an in-depth discussion of gradient descent methods that underpin all deep learning algorithms. As with the prior edition, there are new and updated *Programming Tips* that the illustrate effective Python modules and methods for scientific programming and machine learning. There are 445 run-able code blocks with corresponding outputs that have been tested for accuracy. Over 158 graphical visualizations (almost all generated using Python) illustrate the concepts that are developed both in code and in mathematics. We also discuss and use key Python modules such as Numpy, Scikit-learn, Sympy, Scipy, Lifelines, CvxPy, Theano, Matplotlib, Pandas, Tensorflow, Statsmodels, and Keras.This book is suitable for anyone with an undergraduate-level exposure to probability, statistics, or machine learning and with rudimentary knowledge of Python programming.

好評推薦

	 

	English only documentation is starting to be a major problem for the scientific python ecosystem. This book provides an introduction to the basic usage of Matplotlib, the underlying structure of the architecture, and several of the high-level libraries built on top of matplotlib. Hopefully, this book will provide the context needed for Chinese speakers to better approach and understand the canonical English documentation of the projects.

	 

	Python語言生態圈有一個很主要的問題就是只有英文參考文件。本書介紹了matplotlib套件的基本用法和底層架構，以及建構在Matplotlib套件上幾個高水準的套件(Plotnine、Seaborn和Basemap等)。希望這本書能給中文讀者提供所需的學習內容，更好地幫助讀者學習與了解這些經典的英文技術文件。

	When trying to understand or communicate information one usually asks, what is the best visualization(s) I can make? If this question often comes to you and that you tend not to have an answer, then ""Beautiful Visualizations with Python"" is meant for you. Python is an excellent language for data analysis and visualization. Secondly, the book helps you build a practical toolbox for most visualizations that you may want to create. It strikes a delicate balance between a book that introduces and teaches and a gallery that you can always come back to for ideas. It is not one to throw away after reading. As it is titled, you will learn how to turn data in into beautiful visualizations by making the best choices at every step. Most important for me is that it covers the biggest idea in data visualization in the last 20 years, that is, ""The Grammar of Graphics"".

	 

	當盡力去理解與溝通某人常問的資料資訊時，什麼才是我可以實現的資料視覺化?如果你也經常遇到這個問題，而又沒有答案時，這本書就是專門為你準備的。Python是一門用於資料分析與可視化非常優秀的語言，而這本書可以幫你建立你的工具箱，進一步可以實現你想做的大部分的資料視覺化。這本書不僅能給你介紹、教你資料視覺化，而且能幫你尋找資料視覺化的靈感，兩者兼得。這不是一本你看完就可以束之高閣的書。正如這本書名，你會透過本書一步步的教學模式，學習到如何將資料轉換成優美的圖表。更重要的是，這本書涵蓋了近20年來資料視覺化的核心理念，即「圖形語法」。

Python is one of the most popular of all the computer programming languages, simply because it is one of the easiest to learn. It is an all-purpose language that has a range of different applications, such as:  Web development Mathematical and Scientific Computing Graphical user interface for the desktopPython has a very clean syntax and short code which makes it ideal for the beginner. Not only that, Python is fun because, rather than spending all your time worrying about the syntax, you get to spend time thinking about what your code is going to do instead.Python is an old language, developed in the 1980's and being released for the first time in 1991. It was developed because Guido van Rossum wanted to create a language that was easy to understand and that could access the Amoeba system he was working on. That led to Python, an interpreted and extensible language that was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus for no reason other than the creator was a fan!Python is so much easier to write and to read than many other languages and is one of the most feature-packed. Benefits include:  It's free and its open source - anyone can use Python and anyone can make changes to the source code and distribute it for themselves.  Portable - Python programs can move from one platform to another can be run without the need to make any changes Embeddable and Extensible - Python code can be combined with bits of another computer language to produce a high-performance code and scripting abilities which are not always available with other languages out of the box Interpreted Language - Python does a lot of jobs, like garbage collection, memory management and so on automatically. Also, when your code is run, it will automatically be converted into a code that is understood by your computer system Libraries - Python contains a lot of libraries with much of the code needed to perform common tasks and cut down on the amount of code you need to write Object-Oriented - because everything that is in Python is an object, it is far easier to solve complex problems - each can be broken down into smaller problems through the creation of objects.Python is backed up with a large active community who are constantly striving to improve the language for beginners and experts alike. Use this community as they are of invaluable help to you.If you are quite ready, we are going to look at the basics of Python programming now. First, I will show you how to install it on your computer and then we will go through the basic concepts. There are going to be plenty of examples for you to input into Python and try or yourself. This is the best way to learn so I urge you to get your Python environment set up and work along with this book - you will learn so much more than if you just read it.

What is Python?Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.What can Python do?Python can be used on a server to create web applications.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.Why Python?Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.Good to knowThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.Python Syntax compared to other programming languagesPython was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

What is Python?Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.What can Python do?Python can be used on a server to create web applications.Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.Why Python?Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.Good to knowThe most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.Python Syntax compared to other programming languagesPython was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Introduction to Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB and Python is intended for students and professionals in science, social science, and engineering that wish to learn the principles of computer modeling, as well as basic programming skills. The book content focuses on meeting a set of basic modeling and simulation competencies that were developed as part of several National Science Foundation grants. Even though computer science students are much more expert programmers, they are not often given the opportunity to see how those skills are being applied to solve complex science and engineering problems and may also not be aware of the libraries used by scientists to create those models.The book interleaves chapters on modeling concepts and related exercises with programming concepts and exercises. The authors start with an introduction to modeling and its importance to current practices in the sciences and engineering. They introduce each of the programming environments and the syntax used to represent variables and compute mathematical equations and functions. As students gain more programming expertise, the authors return to modeling concepts, providing starting code for a variety of exercises where students add additional code to solve the problem and provide an analysis of the outcomes. In this way, the book builds both modeling and programming expertise with a ""just-in-time"" approach so that by the end of the book, students can take on relatively simple modeling example on their own.Each chapter is supplemented with references to additional reading, tutorials, and exercises that guide students to additional help and allows them to practice both their programming and analytical modeling skills. In addition, each of the programming related chapters is divided into two parts - one for MATLAB and one for Python. In these chapters, the authors also refer to additional online tutorials that students can use if they are having difficulty with any of the topics.The book culminates with a set of final project exercise suggestions that incorporate both the modeling and programming skills provided in the rest of the volume. Those projects could be undertaken by individuals or small groups of students.The companion website at http: //www.intromodeling.com provides updates to instructions when there are substantial changes in software versions, as well as electronic copies of exercises and the related code. The website also offers a space where people can suggest additional projects they are willing to share as well as comments on the existing projects and exercises throughout the book. Solutions and lecture notes will also be available for qualifying instructors.

Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2018 im Fachbereich Informatik - Computerlinguistik, Note: 13, Justus-Liebig-Universit瓣t Gie?en, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Der Schwerpunkt dieser Hausarbeit liegt auf einem bestimmten Untersuchungsgegenstand, der f羹r eine eigene Sentiment-Analyse herangezogen werden soll. Bei diesem Untersuchungsgegenstand handelt es sich um das bisweilen kontroverse Videospiel The Sims 4, welches insbesondere in j羹ngerer Zeit auf unterschiedlichen sozialen Plattformen im Internet diskutiert worden ist. Im Vordergrund steht dabei die Annahme, dass es aufgrund seiner mitunter kontroversen Natur vor allem h瓣ufig aus einer kritischen, wenn nicht sogar negativen Perspektive heraus diskutiert und bewertet wird; daraus schlie?t sich die Hypothese, dass sich entsprechend eine wesentliche Anzahl von negativ besetzten Meinungen und Gef羹hlen auf der ausgew瓣hlten sozialen Plattform, n瓣mlich Twitter, wiederfinden lassen sollte. Die Frage danach, wie sich Menschen 羹ber bestimmte Ereignisse, Themen, Personen und dergleichen auf einer Meinungs- und Gef羹hlsebene 瓣u?ern, ist vor allem heutzutage, da theoretisch jedermann 羹ber eine 繹ffentliche Stimme dank des Internets und seiner diversen sozialen Plattformen verf羹gt, besonders spannend und aufschlussreich. Unter anderem davon inspiriert ist das Forschungsfeld der Sentiment Analysis, welches sich eben damit auseinandersetzt, auf welche Arten und Weisen Meinungen, Gef羹hle und Stimmungen von Menschen zu den unterschiedlichsten Dingen zum Ausdruck gebracht werden, und wie sie sich ggf. kategorisieren und quantifizieren lassen - sowohl f羹r wissenschaftlich gepr瓣gte Zwecke als auch f羹r diverse Marketing-Absichten.

從無標籤資料應用機器學習解決方案 “研究人員、工程師與學生將會喜歡這本書，因為本書充滿務實的非監督式學習技術，採用平鋪直述的方式，以及囊括了可快速練習的Python範例。” –Sarah Nagy Senior Data Scientist at Edison 許多專家認為非監督式學習是人工智慧的下一個前沿技術，並且是邁向強人工智慧的關鍵。由於世界上大多數資料都沒有標籤，因此無法應用傳統的監督式學習。從另一方面來說，非監督式學習則可以應用在無標籤的資料集，用以發現埋藏在資料深處裡有意義的樣式，而這些樣式幾乎不可能被人類發現。 作者Ankur Patel藉由使用兩個簡單且已經可實際運用於業務開發(production-ready)的Python框架：Scikit-learn和Keras來示範如何應用非監督式學習。透過程式碼和實際操作範例，數據科學家將從資料中識別難以發現的樣式，獲得更深入的商業洞見、檢測異常、執行自動特徵工程和特徵選擇，以及生成合成資料集。你所需要的只是程式能力和一些機器學習經驗。 ‧比較不同機器學習方法的優點和缺點：監督、非監督和強化學習 ‧完整地設置和管理機器學習項目 ‧為信用卡詐欺建立偵測系統 ‧按照相同與不相同將使用者進行分群 ‧實作半監督式學習 ‧使用受限玻爾茲曼機(restricted Boltzmann machine, RBM)開發電影推薦系統 ‧使用生成對抗網路建立合成影像

 可以同時學數學與Python，一石二鳥的書！

 大家常說數學有助於程式設計，不過，很多人在高中時都曾對數學感到挫折吧？

 資料科學、機器學習、區塊鏈......這些以數學理論支撐的領域，正處於百花齊放的狀態。雖然撐過了數學不好的階段，但往後寫程式卻是越來越需要數學。而許多寫給程式設計師的數學書都比較艱深，超過了高中程度。

 如果對數學沒自信，何不從高中程度開始認真複習呢？數學的積累是很重要的，用了程度不適合的教材，反而會欲速則不達。所以，何不就從高中數學開始，循序漸進地站穩腳步呢？

 本書不僅解說數學理論，還搭配了Python的程式來解說，並用來驗證所提到的計算、證明和理論。讀了理論，就能立刻用Python試試。所以不只是讀過而已，還要實際動手，也能培養數學計算的程式設計關鍵能力。

 本書讓你一舉兩得，同時穩固數學與Python的基礎。除了適合數學不在行的文科程式設計師外，也能幫助理工出身卻已忘光數學的程式設計師重拾信心。

 雖然本書是給對Python有大略了解的人，但末尾準備了相關指引，從沒學過的讀者也能安心開始。

Develop a greater intuition for the proper use of cryptography. This book teaches the basics of writing cryptographic algorithms in Python, demystifies cryptographic internals, and demonstrates common ways cryptography is used incorrectly. Cryptography is the lifeblood of the digital world's security infrastructure. From governments around the world to the average consumer, most communications are protected in some form or another by cryptography. These days, even Google searches are encrypted. Despite its ubiquity, cryptography is easy to misconfigure, misuse, and misunderstand.Developers building cryptographic operations into their applications are not typically experts in the subject, and may not fully grasp the implication of different algorithms, modes, and other parameters. The concepts in this book are largely taught by example, including incorrect uses of cryptography and how ""bad"" cryptography can be broken. By digging into the guts of cryptography, you can experience what works, what doesn't, and why. What You'll LearnUnderstand where cryptography is used, why, and how it gets misusedKnow what secure hashing is used for and its basic propertiesGet up to speed on algorithms and modes for block ciphers such as AES, and see how bad configurations breakUse message integrity and/or digital signatures to protect messagesUtilize modern symmetric ciphers such as AES-GCM and CHACHAPractice the basics of public key cryptography, including ECDSA signaturesDiscover how RSA encryption can be broken if insecure padding is usedEmploy TLS connections for secure communicationsFind out how certificates work and modern improvements such as certificate pinning and certificate transparency (CT) logs         Who This Book Is For IT administrators and software developers familiar with Python. Although readers may have some knowledge of cryptography, the book assumes that the reader is starting from scratch.

『數學 ╳ 深度學習 ╳ Python 三效合一』

 深度學習用一句話就可以講完：『用訓練的方式找出一個數學函數，將輸入的資料映射到正確的答案』。重點就在於你如何找出那個對的數學函數！本書將深度學習的數學模型與運算式推導出來之後，還能實際執行 Python 程式幫助瞭解整個運算的過程。

『打開機器學習的黑箱，才發現裏面全都是數學！』

 我們常在機器學習 / 深度學習的文章或書中看到線性迴歸、二元分類、多類別分類、和深度學習等名詞，好像要學很多東西！當然，對不懂數學的人確實如此。不過，一旦您理解深度學習底層的數學原理，就會發現原來架構稍微變一下，函數換一下，其實都是系出同門，一通百通啊。

 要具備這種能力，你必須會微積分、向量/矩陣運算、多變數函數偏微分、指數/對數函數、以及機率/統計。這些在學校都要花很長的時間學習，然而本書考量到您並非想成為數學家或統計學家，因此從中摘取對深度學習最重要的部分濃縮在前半部，幫助您用最短的時間快速掌握數學能力。

 本書是由施威銘研究室監修，適時加上「編註」補充內容幫助理解。如果您行有餘力，還可以繼續閱讀《機器學習的數學基礎：AI、深度學習打底必讀》一書，裏面有更詳細的數學公式推導。

『真正循序漸進，不會一下跳太快』

 本書的一大特色就是每一步只增加一點差異，不會跳得太快。從線性迴歸模型開始，加入 Sigmoid 激活函數 (啟動函數) 就變成二元分類模型，然後將 Sigmoid 換成 Softmax 函數就擴展到多類別分類模型。然後在深度學習，先從一層隱藏層開始推導與實作，並因應需要調整學習率、改用 ReLU 函數等方法改善準確率。並進而擴展到兩層隱藏層，讓模型更加準確。小編真心認為，這樣的編排方式，讓讀者從既有的基礎逐步墊高實力，相當有利於學習，等您跟著本書走過一遍，自然就能心領神會。

 本書隨附『數學快查學習地圖』彩色拉頁，將書中用到的各項數學基礎之間的關係整理成表，幫助您用一張圖看懂本書架構，甚至可裁剪下來隨時參考。作者在 Github 提供 Jupyter Notebook 格式的範例程式，另外您也可以從旗標官網下載 Python 範例程式。

為您的程式穿上美麗的新裝

	 

	自從本書上市以來銷售屢創佳績，畢竟為寫好的程式配上直觀好用且美觀的圖形化介面（GUI，Graphical User Interface），一直是所有程式設計師必要的需求。而書中含有大量繁體中文的視窗截圖，也方便讀者們按圖索驥，且所有程式碼都經由專業的審校老師親自執行驗證，只要直接引用或稍作修改，就能快速達到讀者們對圖形化介面的需求，同時也有助於提昇UX，難怪這段期間以來銷售成績一直持續亮眼。此次，為答謝讀者們對此書的愛好及肯定，特別在新春推出它的暢銷回饋版。想要快速讓自己的程式換上美麗的新裝嗎？拿起這本書，立即施展PyQt5的神奇魔法吧！

	 

從入門到實作應用

帶領您走進圖形化介面的世界

	 

	PyQt是Python用來撰寫圖形化使用者介面（GUI）的解決方案，可以用來代替Python內建的Tkinter。Python可以說是世界上極為廣泛、也非常簡單的程式語言，Qt則是最好的開發程式庫之一，而Python與Qt結合的產物就是PyQt。

	 

	它既能利用Python強大又簡潔的語法，又不會失去Qt的強大功能。從Python的角度來說，凡是Python內含的所有簡潔、易用的語法，都可以應用至PyQt。從Qt的角度來看，以Qt開發出來的功能，在理論上改用PyQt也沒有問題。有些程式邏輯在Qt實作起來會比較複雜，但在PyQt卻很簡單，這才是PyQt最大的魅力之處。

	 

	此外，PyQt5與PyQt4並不相容。Qt開發團隊已經明確宣佈，從2015年開始就放棄Qt4（對應至PyQt4）的支援，因此，對於想要瞭解PyQt的朋友來說，一開始就學習PyQt5是一個最好的選擇。

	 

	＊具備Python與PyQt的入門知識，即使初學者也能夠有所助益。

	＊摒棄已不再被支援的PyQt4，直接學習大幅改版後的PyQt5。

	＊介紹Qt Designer的用法，帶領您快速進入PyQt圖形化介面的世界。

	＊PyQt5的佈局管理、訊號與槽的應用、圖形和特效的美化技巧盡在本書。

	＊以實際案例，使讀者理解PyQt5在軟體專案和金融領域裡要如何應用。

在Python裡，最重要的套件應該是pandas。非資訊專長的初學者要學Python，一定要學pandas，因為它容易入手，而且功能強大。pandas具有強大的資料分析、繪圖能力，甚至能做網路爬蟲。將pandas分析結果回存到Excel也是輕而易舉！本書就是著重在pandas的介紹。而本書的另一特色是，筆者會設計許多用Python來解決的問題。研究發現，問題導向學習有助提升學習熱情和學習成效。藉由在實際問題中引發學習動機和熱情，並且親自操作，來尋找問題答案並解決問題！Boud（1987）就主張，學習的起點應該始於學習者想要解決的問題、疑問或困擾。因此，我設計的這些問題只是起點，更希望讀者能將這些知識與生活或工作遭遇的問題做連結，進一步提出屬於自己的問題，並累積解決問題的技巧。

Python makes machine learning easy for beginners and experienced developers With computing power increasing exponentially and costs decreasing at the same time, there is no better time to learn machine learning using Python. Machine learning tasks that once required enormous processing power are now possible on desktop machines. However, machine learning is not for the faint of heart--it requires a good foundation in statistics, as well as programming knowledge. Python Machine Learning will help coders of all levels master one of the most in-demand programming skillsets in use today.  Readers will get started by following fundamental topics such as an introduction to Machine Learning and Data Science. For each learning algorithm, readers will use a real-life scenario to show how Python is used to solve the problem at hand. - Python data science--manipulating data and data visualization - Data cleansing - Understanding Machine learning algorithms - Supervised learning algorithms - Unsupervised learning algorithms - Deploying machine learning models  Python Machine Learning is essential reading for students, developers, or anyone with a keen interest in taking their coding skills to the next level.

Machine Learning with Spark and Python Essential Techniques for Predictive Analytics, Second Edition simplifies ML for practical uses by focusing on two key algorithms. This new second edition improves with the addition of Spark--a ML framework from the Apache foundation. By implementing Spark, machine learning students can easily process much large data sets and call the spark algorithms using ordinary Python code.  Machine Learning with Spark and Python focuses on two algorithm families (linear methods and ensemble methods) that effectively predict outcomes. This type of problem covers many use cases such as what ad to place on a web page, predicting prices in securities markets, or detecting credit card fraud. The focus on two families gives enough room for full descriptions of the mechanisms at work in the algorithms. Then the code examples serve to illustrate the workings of the machinery with specific hackable code.

Many industry experts consider unsupervised learning the next frontier in artificial intelligence, one that may hold the key to general artificial intelligence. Since the majority of the world's data is unlabeled, conventional supervised learning cannot be applied. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, can be applied to unlabeled datasets to discover meaningful patterns buried deep in the data, patterns that may be near impossible for humans to uncover.Author Ankur Patel shows you how to apply unsupervised learning using two simple, production-ready Python frameworks: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow using Keras. With code and hands-on examples, data scientists will identify difficult-to-find patterns in data and gain deeper business insight, detect anomalies, perform automatic feature engineering and selection, and generate synthetic datasets. All you need is programming and some machine learning experience to get started.Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different machine learning approaches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learningSet up and manage machine learning projects end-to-endBuild an anomaly detection system to catch credit card fraudClusters users into distinct and homogeneous groupsPerform semisupervised learningDevelop movie recommender systems using restricted Boltzmann machinesGenerate synthetic images using generative adversarial networks

聶Practical Python聶 offers a highly useful guide to the Python programming language. In disarmingly readable prose, author Magnus Lie Hetland guides readers through those concepts of most importance to the budding Python developer. Following a succinct overview of the installation process, Hetland brings the reader up to speed regarding the general programming precepts common to every high-level language, including datatypes, conditionals and looping, abstractions, and modularity. Notably, Hetland takes great care to provide a thorough introduction to Python聶s potentially confusing datatype offering, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries, providing numerous examples aimed towards familiarizing the reader with their subtle, yet important differences. Primed with the language's foundational knowledge, readers are then introduced to Python聶s file-handling, database, GUI, and string-handling capabilities. Additionally, readers are treated to an excellent review of Python聶s object-oriented, functional, and exception-handling capabilities. All chapters are peppered with references to Python's useful built-in functions, which are done with the intention of demonstrating the considerable features offered by the default Python distribution. Hetland devotes the second half of the book to project development, taking great care to choose a series of ten increasingly complex applications that are of timely and wide-ranging interest to burgeoning and expert developers alike. Project focus includes automated document conversion, newsgroup administration, graphical PDF document generation, remote document maintenance, the creation of a peer-to-peer system with XML-RPC, database integration, and GUI and game development. Magnus Lie Hetland is a Ph.D. student at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology where he works with algorithms for knowledge discovery in sequences. He has been a devoted Python fan for years and is well known for his online tutorials, 聶Instant Python聶 and 聶Instant Hacking聶. He is the founder and lead developer of Anygui (http: //www.anygui.org), a respected Python GUI unification project

	本書以條列式介紹常用的 python 語法，避免冗長文字陳述，
	使你能快速抓住重點，縮短語法學習的時間，即使重新閱讀時也能很快回復記憶。
	然而，程式語法不等於程式設計，撰寫程式首先要有明確的解題步驟，才能由之轉為程式碼。
	若沒有解題步驟，縱使有滿肚子的程式語法，也無法完成程式設計。
	程式設計之所以讓許多人學而無功，往往是因為忘了在程式設計過程中利用數學。
	許多程式問題表面上看不到數學，但並不表示數學不存在，
	數學善於偽裝，經常隱身於問題之後，若要完成程式設計，就得將隱藏於幕後的數學問題抓出來解決。
	本書特別教授如何在面對程式問題時利用「數學思維」來分析問題，找出解題步驟，
	再由之轉為程式碼以完成程式設計。
	當你能善用「數學思維」於程式設計中，就經常能「突然間」找到程式問題的解題步驟，
	學習成效即會大增，同時學習過程充滿著成就感，撰寫程式就會變成一種享受。

加強版馬力升級，學習更有效率！

 本書介紹竊取傳遞檔案功能的設計，以及偷取密碼的鍵盤記錄功能。整個木馬以Python寫成，適合已學習並對Python具有最基本編寫能力的讀者。

 除了傳遞檔案、鍵盤記錄功能外，本書最為特別的地方在於靈活運用Python語法的巧思，例如：運用類別即物件的特性，依類別改變程式流程；巧用dict讓Python具有類似C語言的switch。另外，駭客製作木馬時，為了躲避除錯器的追踪，發展出運用exception來改變程式的走向的技巧。本書將這種運用exception的手法以Python實作出來呈現給大家，讓大家對於駭客的思路和程式設計的技巧有更多的認識。

 本加強版在程式做了些許修正，增加自動化產生參數設定檔，測試程式時不再需要手動修改原始碼，增加讀者們學習及測試的效率。也因為這樣的修正，使得本書所有附錄也做了整體的更新。除此之外，還增加了一個全新的章節來教導讀者如何做木馬的設定。

This book is for people with no experience with machine learning and who are looking for an intuition-based, hands-on introduction to deep learning using Python. Deep Learning for Complete Beginners: A Python-Based Introduction is for complete beginners in machine learning. It introduces fundamental concepts such as classes and labels, building a dataset, and what a model is and does before presenting classic machine learning models, neural networks, and modern convolutional neural networks. Experiments in Python--working with leading open-source toolkits and standard datasets--give you hands-on experience with each model and help you build intuition about how to transfer the examples in the book to your own projects. You'll start with an introduction to the Python language and the NumPy extension that is ubiquitous in machine learning. Prominent toolkits, like sklearn and Keras/TensorFlow are used as the backbone to enable you to focus on the elements of machine learning without the burden of writing implementations from scratch. An entire chapter on evaluating the performance of models gives you the knowledge necessary to understand claims on performance and to know which models are working well and which are not. The book culminates by presenting convolutional neural networks as an introduction to modern deep learning. Understanding how these networks work and how they are affected by parameter choices leaves you with the core knowledge necessary to dive into the larger, ever-changing world of deep learning.

This book is a course on Django for Python developers. The better you know Python, the easier it will be to learn Django. Conversely, one of the great things about learning Django is that it will help you improve your Python skills. The Django framework is written beautifully and you have full access to the source code. I encourage you to dig into that code to see why things work the way they do and to learn how you can customize your site to work exactly how you want it to work.What You Will LearnThrough more than 80 exercises and 100s of demos, you will learn to build a fully functional website using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Amazon S3 (for media storage), SendGrid, and Heroku.To get a feel for all you will learn...Visit the home page at djangojokes.com. Refresh the page a couple of times and notice it outputs a random joke each time.You will create a basic home page and about-us page.On the About page (accessible from the footer), click the Work for us link. This takes you to an application form, which will generate an email letting us know that someone has applied. Notice that it includes a Resume field. The user will be able to upload a resume. We will teach you to make sure uploaded files aren't dangerous and to protect private files like resumes.Click the Jokes link in the header. You will see a tabular list of jokes, each of which has a category, zero or more tags, a creator's username, and a rating with the number of votes.Click on the Joke, Creator, or Category heading to sort by those fields. Click again on the same field to sort in the opposite direction.Use the Order By form at the top to sort by other fields.Click on a category, a tag, or a username to filter jokes.Use the Search form at the top to search for jokes.Open a joke and try voting on it. You will get a message saying only logged-in users can vote.Back on the Jokes list, click the New Joke button. Notice that you are taken to a login form. Only logged-in users can create jokes.Click the Register link below the login form or the Sign up link in the header to create an account and complete the registration process, which includes confirming your email address.When you log in, notice that you have the chance to reset your password if you forgot it.Now that you are logged in, click the New Joke button again. Add a really funny (but clean) joke. Because this site is live, we have a joke approval process, so your joke won't immediately be public. Only you will see it, and there will be a ""Pending Approval"" note at the bottom.Notice the Update button. You can update jokes you create.Go back to the Jokes list, and open a joke (not the one that you created). Notice that you can now vote on it. Vote a few times on the same joke. Notice that it lets you change your vote, but doesn't register multiple votes by the same user for the same joke.From the Me menu in the header, click My Django Jokes. It will show your added jokes.From the Me menu, click My Account. Notice that you can update your profile and add an avatar. You will learn to allow users to upload profile pictures. You will also learn to validate the uploaded file.You will also learn to use and customize Django admin, Django's built-in administration interface.Other technologies used, but not taught, in the book include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and SQL. Experience with those technologies will serve you well, both in becoming a Django programmer, and in working through this book.

	從入門到實作應用
	帶領您走進圖形化介面的世界

	PyQt是Python用來撰寫圖形化使用者介面（GUI）的解決方案，可以用來代替Python內建的Tkinter。Python可以說是世界上極為廣泛、也非常簡單的程式語言，Qt則是最好的開發程式庫之一，而Python與Qt結合的產物就是PyQt。

	它既能利用Python強大又簡潔的語法，又不會失去Qt的強大功能。從Python的角度來說，凡是Python內含的所有簡潔、易用的語法，都可以應用至PyQt。從Qt的角度來看，以Qt開發出來的功能，在理論上改用PyQt也沒有問題。有些程式邏輯在Qt實作起來會比較複雜，但在PyQt卻很簡單，這才是PyQt最大的魅力之處。

	此外，PyQt5與PyQt4並不相容。Qt開發團隊已經明確宣佈，從2015年開始就放棄Qt4（對應至PyQt4）的支援，因此，對於想要瞭解PyQt的朋友來說，一開始就學習PyQt5是一個最好的選擇。

	＊具備Python與PyQt的入門知識，即使初學者也能夠有所助益。
	＊摒棄已不再被支援的PyQt4，直接學習大幅改版後的PyQt5。
	＊介紹Qt Designer的用法，帶領您快速進入PyQt圖形化介面的世界。
	＊PyQt5的佈局管理、訊號與槽的應用、圖形和特效的美化技巧盡在本書。
	＊以實際案例，使讀者理解PyQt5在軟體專案和金融領域裡要如何應用。

Learn how to program in Python while making and breaking ciphers--algorithms used to create and send secret messages! After a crash course in Python programming basics, you'll learn to make, test, and hack programs that encrypt text with classical ciphers like the transposition cipher and Vigen癡re cipher. You'll begin with simple programs for the reverse and Caesar ciphers and then work your way up to public key cryptography, the type of encryption used to secure today's online transactions, including digital signatures, email, and Bitcoin. Each program includes the full code and a line-by-line explanation of how things work. By the end of the book, you'll have learned how to code in Python and you'll have the clever programs to prove it! You'll also learn how to: - Combine loops, variables, and flow control statements into real working programs- Use dictionary files to instantly detect whether decrypted messages are valid English or gibberish- Create test programs to make sure that your code encrypts and decrypts correctly- Code (and hack!) a working example of the affine cipher, which uses modular arithmetic to encrypt a message- Break ciphers with techniques such as brute-force and frequency analysis There's no better way to learn to code than to play with real programs. Cracking Codes with Python makes the learning fun!

Scientific Python is a significant public domain alternative to expensive proprietary software packages. This book teaches from scratch everything the working scientist needs to know using copious, downloadable, useful and adaptable code snippets. Readers will discover how easy it is to implement and test non-trivial mathematical algorithms and will be guided through the many freely available add-on modules. A range of examples, relevant to many different fields, illustrate the language's capabilities. The author also shows how to use pre-existing legacy code (usually in Fortran77) within the Python environment, thus avoiding the need to master the original code. In this new edition, several chapters have been re-written to reflect the IPython notebook style. With an extended index, an entirely new chapter discussing SymPy and a substantial increase in the number of code snippets, researchers and research students will be able to quickly acquire all the skills needed for using Python effectively.

This book provides readers with an in-depth discussion of circuit simulation, combining basic electrical engineering circuit theory with Python programming. It fills an information gap by describing the development of Python Power Electronics, an open-source software for simulating circuits, and demonstrating its use in a sample circuit. Unlike typical books on circuit theory that describe how circuits can be solved mathematically, followed by examples of simulating circuits using specific, commercial software, this book has a different approach and focus. The author begins by describing every aspect of the open-source software, in the context of non-linear power electronic circuits, as a foundation for aspiring or practicing engineers to embark on further development of open source software for different purposes. By demonstrating explicitly the operation of the software through algorithms, this book brings together the fields of electrical engineering and software technology.

	學習CAE軟體最大的問題絕對不會是操作或概念，一般CAE使用者的強項通常都是在設計或理論，當遇到需要控制時，往往必須依靠程式語言來處理。程式語言本身就是一門大學問，再加上要和CAE整合，往往被使用者視為畏途。Abaqus Python就是解決這個問題的最佳答案。Python易學易用功能強大，語法簡單清楚直覺，已儼然成為程式語言的王者，現在跨足CAE，更是學習者的一大福音。

	 

	本書作者結合自己多年Abaqus使用經驗，採用語言API說明+實例說明的方法來介紹Abaqus/Python使用過程中比較有意思的一些基礎知識，希望能幫助讀者進入Abaqus/Python的領域。

""This book is so good. I wish I'd written it."" -- Tim Hopper (@tdhopper)""Highly recommended: a grand tour of computer science theory and practical software engineering, explored through the lens of 10 Fizz Buzz solutions in Python. Outstanding."" -- Paco Nathan (@pacoid)""I'd never have thought a book about Fizz Buzz would make me a better programmer, but I was wrong. Joel in the course of 10 chapters does a broad survey of core Python concepts, software design and testing, mathematics, and more (including deep learning) using Fizz Buzz as the guiding example. It's that rare technical book that remains engaging, entertaining, and accessible."" -- Binal Patel (@binalkp91)More real Python tips than any ""Python tricks"" book! From a Python beginner to an experienced ML practitioner, you're bound to learn something about the language and its application to a progressive level of algorithmic applications. Recommended for the anyone looking to ""level up"" their Python or problem solving skills! -- Tom Marthaler (@tmarthal)Fizz Buzz is the following (simple) problem: Print the numbers from 1 to 100, except that if the number is divisible by 3, instead print ""fizz""; if the number is divisible by 5, instead print ""buzz""; and if the number is divisible by 15, instead print ""fizzbuzz"".It originated as a children's game, but has since taken on a new life as a lowest-common-denominator litmus test for assessing computer programmers.If you are an experienced programmer, it is an extremely easy problem to solve. Because of this, it has taken on a third life as the prototypical bad interview problem. Everyone knows that it's the question you ask people to make sure that they're not completely incompetent as programmers. Accordingly, if your interviewer asks you to solve it, he's suggesting he thinks it possible that you're completely incompetent as a programmer. You would not be wrong to feel insulted!My association with this problem began in 2016, when I wrote a blog post called Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow, the (possibly fictional) story of one such insulted programmer who decided to show up his interviewer by approaching Fizz Buzz as a deep learning problem. This post went modestly viral, and ever since then I have been seen as a thought leader in the Fizz Buzz space.Accordingly, over the years I have come up with and/or collected various other stupid and/or clever ways of solving Fizz Buzz. I have not blogged about them, as I am not the sort of person who beats a joke to death, but occasionally I will tweet about them, and recently in response someone suggested that I write a book on ""100 Ways of Writing Fizz Buzz in Python.""Now, I could probably come up with 100 ways of solving Fizz Buzz, but most of them would not be very interesting. Luckily for you, I was able to come up with 10 that are interesting in various ways, each of which turned out to be a good launching-off point for (sometimes meandering) discussions of various aspects of coding, Python, Fizz Buzz, mathematics, software design, technical interviewing, and various other topics.Hence ""Ten Essays on Fizz Buzz"".In many ways this is a strange book. Its goal is not to teach you a specific field or a specific technology. I hope you will learn a lot from reading it, but it's not really a book that you'd read in order to learn anything in particular. Most technical books are about specific technical topics; this one sort of isn't.Nonetheless, it is a technical book. Each essay contains code that implements a different solution of Fizz Buzz. Each essay uses code to illustrate its ideas. Each essay represents my current best thinking about how to solve problems using code. If you have a coding job, you should feel no reluctance to expense this book to your employer

For courses in Python ProgrammingIntroduces Python programming with an emphasis on problem-solvingNow in its Third Edition, Practice of Computing Using Python continues to introduce both majors and non-majors taking CS1 courses to computational thinking using Python, with a strong emphasis on problem solving through computer science. The authors have chosen Python for its simplicity, powerful built-in data structures, advanced control constructs, and practicality. The text is built from the ground up for Python programming, rather than having been translated from Java or C++.Focusing on data manipulation and analysis as a theme, the text allows students to work on real problems using Internet-sourced or self-generated data sets that represent their own work and interests. The authors also emphasize program development and provide both majors and non-majors with a practical foundation in programming that will be useful in their respective fields. Among other changes, the Third Edition incorporates a switch to the Anaconda distribution, the SPYDER IDE, and a focus on debugging and GUIs.MyProgrammingLabot included. Students, if MyProgrammingLab is a recommended/mandatory component of the course, please ask your instructor for the correct ISBN and course ID. MyProgrammingLab should only be purchased when required by an instructor. Instructors, contact your Pearson representative for more information.MyProgrammingLab is an online learning system designed to engage students and improve results. MyProgrammingLab consists of a set of programming exercises correlated to specific Pearson CS1/Intro to Programming textbooks. Through practice exercises and immediate, personalized feedback, MyProgrammingLab improves the programming competence of beginning students who often struggle with the basic concepts of programming languages.

◆本書淺顯易懂的原理說明
◆Step by Step實機操作
◆範例程式詳細解說
◆大幅降低機器學習與大數據技術的學習門檻

機器學習正熱門
	機器學習是近20多年興起的多領域學科，機器學習演算法可從大量數據中建立模型，並利用模型對未知數據進行預測。近年來各大公司google、 facebook、microsoft、IBM…等，全力投入機器學習研究與應用，以Google為例，Google早已將機器學習，運用在垃圾郵件判 斷、自動回覆、照片分類與搜尋、翻譯、語音辨識等功能。在你在不知不覺中，機器學習已經讓日常生活更便利。

「大數據」與「機器學習」相輔相成
	大數據的特性: 大量資料、多樣化、速度快。因此如何從大量資料中擷取出有用的資訊，是大數據的主要課題。機器學習需要大量資料進行訓練，並且訓練過程需大量運算。正好大 數據的興起帶來大量資料，以及可儲存大量數據的分散式儲存技術，例如:Hadoop HDFS、NoSQL..。還有分散式運算可進行大量運算，例如Spark 基於記憶體內的分散式運算框架，可以大幅提升效能。

Python與Spark與Hadoop的完美結合
	本書的主題是Python+Spark+Hadoop機器學習與大數據分析：使用Python開發Spark應用程式，具有多重好處，既可以享有 Python語言特性所帶來的好處：程式碼簡明、易學習、高生產力的特質。再加上Spark基於記憶體內的分散式運算框架，非常適合需多次重覆運算的機器 學習演算法，可以大幅提升效能。Spark可輕易讀取Hadoop分散式儲存技術HDFS。Spark也可以在Hadoop 新MapReduce架構YARN執行。

Python與Spark機器學習與資料視覺化
	Python資料分析的相 關模組如NumPy、Matplotlib、Pandas、Scikit-learn，讓Python成為資料分析主要語言之一。使用Python開發 Spark機器學習應用時，你仍然可以繼續使用這些模組，這對於Python開發者帶來很大的方便，例如：你可以使用Spark ML Pipeline機器學習、訓練、預測。並且可以將Spark DataFrames轉換為Pandas DataFrame。轉換後你就可以運用Python豐富的資料視覺化套件，例如matplotlib、Bokeh…等，進行資料視覺化。

本書特色

	實機操作建置Spark+Hadoop機器學習與大數據平台
	一般人學習大數據的困難是，沒有多台機器建立分散式系統，但是透過本書介紹使用Virtual Box虛擬機器的方法，就能在自家電腦演練建立Hadoop叢集，並且建立Python Spark機器學習開發環境。

	以實務範例程式學會Python+Spark機器學習與大數據
	以 大數據實務案例MovieLens(電影喜好推薦引擎)、StumbleUpon (網頁二元分類)、Covtype（森林覆蓋多元分類），BikeSharing(類Ubike租借數量迴歸分析)，介紹如何使用Python Spark運用機器學習演算法：決策樹、邏輯迴歸、支持向量機器SVM、單純貝氏。進行資料處理、訓練、建立模型、訓練驗證找出最佳模型、預測結果。

You're already a smart person, you don't need a 1000+ page book to get you started on the web's fastest growing programming platform. Instead, Learn Python in One Hour delivers on the promise of code literacy while saving your most precious commodity - time itself. Volkman's innovative programming-by-example approach means you focus on usage, not mindless detail. Based on the author's sold-out live seminars, you'll see Python's flexible coding technique in action as we refactor from script to procedural to object-oriented during actual problem solving. In a twelve-lesson progression, you'll be exposed to this and more:   Basic file input and output operations, incuding exceptions Using functions to compute and return multiple values Basic elements of a class definition and how to call methods Lists, dictionaries, sets, and other collections Iteration through collections, files, sorted sets Searching strings with regular expressions (regex) Client and server programs for REST methods Using threads in Python for multiple tasks CGI-BIN programming for simple HTML Forms processing Six most common Python pitfalls  Take the One Hour challenge and see if you too can pick up 90% of syntax and semantics in less time than you probably spend commuting each day.  About the Author Victor R. Volkman graduated cum laude from Michigan Technological University with a BS in Computer Science in 1986. Since then, he has written for numerous publications, including The C Gazette, C++ Users Journal, Windows Developers Journal,  and many others. He has taught college-level programming courses at Washtenaw Community College and has served on its Computer Information Science (CIS) Faculty Advisory Board for more than a decade.

Acknowledgments I wouldn't have even started this project if not for the endless encouragement from my lovely wife, Angel. She's been my sounding board, my task manager, my copy editor and my own personal cheerleader. There's no way I could do anything like this without her help and support. I'd also like to thank my technical reviewer, George, for everything he's done to help me out. He's gone above and beyond the limits of his role, helping with everything from code to grammar and even a good bit of style. After enjoying his help on Pro Django, I wouldn't have even signed on for another book without him by my side. Lastly, I never would've considered a book like this if not for the wonderful community around Python. The willingness of Python programmers to open their minds and their code is, I believe, unrivaled among our peers. It's this spirit of openness that encourages me every day, leading me to discover new things and push myself beyond the limits of what I knew yesterday. We learn by doing and by seeing what others have done. I hope that you'll take the contents of this book and do more with it than what I've done. There's no better reward for all this hard work than to see better programmers writing better code.

As you've seen, text is integral to most Python programs, and you saw how often of our examples use it. We take text input from users, manipulate that text, and display messages in response. This is why Python comes with so many text-related features. In this chapter, you learned how to split and join strings; format, edit, and search for strings; use regular expressions to search for patterns within strings; and work with the files on your file system. We then applied much of this in our example application. 160 C H A P T E R 8 ? ? ? Executable Files, Organization, and Python on the Web Up to this point, you've been running your scripts via the python interpreter. This is all well and good, but it would be nice if we could get the scripts to run by themselves, just like real programs, so that's just what we'll look at first. I'll then cover how to organize and spruce up your code, because clean, organized code makes you more efficient and gives you time to write even more lovely Python code. This leads us onto some of the dynamic features of Python: modules and the exec() and eval() functions. These features give you more flexibility and choice when writing Python applications.

It provides the answers to questions such as: What is the best way to convert from binary to ASCII?; How do I work with full text indexing?; How do I find a URL or an email address in text?; What are the different levels of pattern matching?; How do I process a report with a concrete state machine?; How do I parse, create and manipulate HTML documents?; How do I handle a lossless and lossy compression?; And what is the most efficient way to find codepoints in Unicode?

Python Standard Library is an essential guide for serious Python programmers. Python is a modular language that imports most useful operations from the standard library (basic support modules; operating system interfaces; network protocols; file formats; data conversions; threads and processes; and data storage). You can't really program in Python without using it. In this book, author Fredrik Lundh, creator of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), delivers tested, accurate documentation of all the modules in the Python Standard Library, along with over 300 annotated example scripts using the modules.Python Standard Library renders this valuable information in a clean, easy-to-read format, yet doesn't talk down to readers. This accurate and complete reference documentation is for the Python programmer who wants the facts and little else.The book is based on the author's work with the Python newsgroup: he reviewed more than 2500 questions and answers to that newsgroup in order to make sure the book covered what Python users really wanted to know. An earlier version of this book has been available electronically for over a year, so the material has been tested by Python programmers in real-life applications.This version of Python Standard Library covers all the new modules and related information for Python 2.0, the first new major release of Python in four years.
